Artificial Intelligence (AI) may offer solutions to the current challenges involved in mental health care. We therefore explored PCPs’ challenges in addressing adolescents’ mental health, along with their attitudes towards using AI to assist them in their tasks. We used purposeful sampling to recruit PCPs for a virtual Focus Group (FG). The virtual FG lasted 75 minutes and was moderated by two facilitators. A life transcription was produced by an online meeting software. Transcribed data was cleaned, followed by a priori and inductive coding and thematic analysis. We reached out to 35 potential participants via email. Seven agreed to participate, and ultimately four took part in the FG. PCPs perceived that AI systems have the potential to be cost-effective, credible, and useful in collecting large amounts of patients’ data, and relatively credible. They envisioned AI assisting with tasks such as diagnoses and establishing treatment plans. However, they feared that reliance on AI might result in a loss of clinical competency. PCPs wanted AI systems to be user-friendly, and they were willing to assist in achieving this goal if it was within their scope of practice and they were compensated for their contribution. They stressed a need for regulatory bodies to deal with medicolegal and ethical aspects of AI and clear guidelines to reduce or eliminate the potential of patient harm.

Yıldız,2025.0,2025-03-31,Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing,3,Semantic Scholar,"ABSTRACT Background Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are increasingly being integrated into mental health nursing, presenting opportunities alongside challenges. Aim This article aims to examine the complex balance between leveraging AI for clinical efficiency and preserving indispensable human elements such as empathy and the therapeutic relationship in mental health nursing. Method Utilizing a review of literature, theoretical approaches, and insights from field observations, this debate essay explores the integration of AI, focusing on potential benefits, risks, and ethical considerations. Results Findings indicate that while AI offers undeniable contributions to diagnostic processes and care coordination, its role should be complementary, not substitutive. Excessive reliance on algorithms risks damaging the patient‐nurse relationship, potentially reducing individuals to data points. Significant ethical issues, including data privacy and algorithmic bias, require careful consideration. Conclusion AI should be implemented to enhance, not replace, human interaction in mental health nursing. A new synthesis is proposed where AI systems support efficiency, thereby allowing nurses more time to address patients’ complex emotional needs. Key recommendations include restructuring nursing education, creating robust feedback channels, and establishing comprehensive ethical principles to preserve the essential human dimension of care.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad35f379bd5d9154a4c4877768d9fbff24ab157c,None

McKee; Nenad Tomasev,2024.0,2024-03-01,BMJ Open,4,Semantic Scholar,"Introduction For artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve mental healthcare, the design of data-driven technologies needs to be fair, safe, and inclusive. Participatory design can play a critical role in empowering marginalised communities to take an active role in constructing research agendas and outputs. Given the unmet needs of the LGBTQI+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex) community in mental healthcare, there is a pressing need for participatory research to include a range of diverse queer perspectives on issues of data collection and use (in routine clinical care as well as for research) as well as AI design. Here we propose a protocol for a Delphi consensus process for the development of PARticipatory Queer AI Research for Mental Health (PARQAIR-MH) practices, aimed at informing digital health practices and policy. Methods and analysis The development of PARQAIR-MH is comprised of four stages. In stage 1, a review of recent literature and fact-finding consultation with stakeholder organisations will be conducted to define a terms-of-reference for stage 2, the Delphi process. Our Delphi process consists of three rounds, where the first two rounds will iterate and identify items to be included in the final Delphi survey for consensus ratings. Stage 3 consists of consensus meetings to review and aggregate the Delphi survey responses, leading to stage 4 where we will produce a reusable toolkit to facilitate participatory development of future bespoke LGBTQI+–adapted data collection, harmonisation, and use for data-driven AI applications specifically in mental healthcare settings. Ethics and dissemination PARQAIR-MH aims to deliver a toolkit that will help to ensure that the specific needs of LGBTQI+ communities are accounted for in mental health applications of data-driven technologies. The study is expected to run from June 2024 through January 2025, with the final outputs delivered in mid-2025. Participants in the Delphi process will be recruited by snowball and opportunistic sampling via professional networks and social media (but not by direct approach to healthcare service users, patients, specific clinical services, or via clinicians’ caseloads). Participants will not be required to share personal narratives and experiences of healthcare or treatment for any condition. Before agreeing to participate, people will be given information about the issues considered to be in-scope for the Delphi (eg, developing best practices and methods for collecting and harmonising sensitive characteristics data; developing guidelines for data use/reuse) alongside specific risks of unintended harm from participating that can be reasonably anticipated. Outputs will be made available in open-access peer-reviewed publications, blogs, social media, and on a dedicated project website for future reuse.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a91e31c4e4e0102b425f1d3edc45cebb9684fefd,None

With a doctor-patient ratio of 1:834 in India, AI has the potential to alleviate a significant health care burden. Public perception plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes that can facilitate the adoption of new technologies. Similarly, the acceptance of AI-driven mental health interventions is crucial in determining their effectiveness and widespread adoption. Therefore, it is essential to study public perceptions and usage of existing AI-driven mental health interventions by exploring user experiences and opinions on their future applicability, particularly in comparison to traditional, human-based interventions. Objective This study aims to explore the use, perception, and acceptance of AI-driven mental health interventions in comparison to traditional, human-based interventions. Methods A total of 466 adult participants from India voluntarily completed a 30-item web-based survey on the use and perception of AI-based mental health interventions between November and December 2023. Results Of the 466 respondents, only 163 (35%) had ever consulted a mental health professional. Additionally, 305 (65.5%) reported very low knowledge of AI-driven interventions. In terms of trust, 247 (53%) expressed a moderate level of Trust in AI-Driven Mental Health Interventions, while only 24 (5.2%) reported a high level of trust. By contrast, 114 (24.5%) reported high trust and 309 (66.3%) reported moderate Trust in Human-Based Mental Health Interventions; 242 (51.9%) participants reported a high level of stigma associated with using human-based interventions, compared with only 50 (10.7%) who expressed concerns about stigma related to AI-driven interventions. Additionally, 162 (34.8%) expressed a positive outlook toward the future use and social acceptance of AI-based interventions. The majority of respondents indicated that AI could be a useful option for providing general mental health tips and conducting initial assessments. The key benefits of AI highlighted by participants were accessibility, cost-effectiveness, 24/7 availability, and reduced stigma. Major concerns included data privacy, security, the lack of human touch, and the potential for misdiagnosis. Conclusions There is a general lack of awareness about AI-driven mental health interventions. However, AI shows potential as a viable option for prevention, primary assessment, and ongoing mental health maintenance. Currently, people tend to trust traditional mental health practices more. Stigma remains a significant barrier to accessing traditional mental health services. Currently, the human touch remains an indispensable aspect of human-based mental health care, one that AI cannot replace. However, integrating AI with human mental health professionals is seen as a compelling model. AI is positively perceived in terms of accessibility, availability, and destigmatization.

Access to care is hindered by multiple factors that create or contribute to delays; psychosocial support is limited, and long-term follow-up programs are scarce. With the rising awareness and utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, this project explored the possible applications of AI-driven tools to enhance the experiences of AYA cancer survivors in SSA. Led by a young adult brain tumor survivor and cancer advocate, this work aimed to examine how AI can be leveraged to address psychosocial, informational, and care coordination gaps for AYA survivors in low-resource settings. Using a survivor-led, qualitative approach, we conducted informal interviews with AYA cancer survivors in Nigeria. Emerging themes were reviewed to identify feasible opportunities for AI use in the African AYA cancer space. Three main themes emerged: (1) Critical need for AYA mental health and peer-support resources, (2) Need for culturally sensitive, youth-friendly digital tools that are co-designed with AYA survivors. (3) AI is a potential bridge to care, especially in resource-limited SSA. AI-enabled symptom tracking and chatbots were seen as promising tools to improve follow-up and emotional support. Survivorship support for AYA brain tumor patients in SSA is underexplored and inadequate. Survivor-led insights suggest that AI has the potential to improve outcomes, engagement, and quality of life. The integration of AI into survivorship protocols could improve long-term care in SSA.

Health,79,Semantic Scholar,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots have the potential to substantially increase access to affordable and effective mental health services by supplementing the work of clinicians. Their 24/7 availability and accessibility through a mobile phone allow individuals to obtain help whenever and wherever needed, overcoming financial and logistical barriers. Although psychological AI chatbots have the ability to make significant improvements in providing mental health care services, they do not come without ethical and technical challenges. Some major concerns include providing inadequate or harmful support, exploiting vulnerable populations, and potentially producing discriminatory advice due to algorithmic bias. However, it is not always obvious for users to fully understand the nature of the relationship they have with chatbots. There can be significant misunderstandings about the exact purpose of the chatbot, particularly in terms of care expectations, ability to adapt to the particularities of users and responsiveness in terms of the needs and resources/treatments that can be offered. Hence, it is imperative that users are aware of the limited therapeutic relationship they can enjoy when interacting with mental health chatbots. Ignorance or misunderstanding of such limitations or of the role of psychological AI chatbots may lead to a therapeutic misconception (TM) where the user would underestimate the restrictions of such technologies and overestimate their ability to provide actual therapeutic support and guidance. TM raises major ethical concerns that can exacerbate one's mental health contributing to the global mental health crisis.

Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain.

Participatory design can play a critical role in empowering marginalised communities to take an active role in constructing research agendas and outputs. Given the unmet needs of the LGBTQI+ community in mental health care, there is a pressing need for participatory research to include a range of diverse queer perspectives on issues of data collection and use (in routine clinical care as well as for research) as well as AI design. Here we propose a protocol for a Delphi consensus process for the development of PARticipatory Queer AI Research for Mental Health (PARQAIR-MH) practices, aimed at informing digital health practices and policy. Methods and Analysis: The development of PARQAIR-MH is comprised of four stages; In Stage 1, a review of recent literature and fact-finding consultation with stakeholder organisations will be conducted to define a terms-of-reference for Stage 2, the Delphi process. Our Delphi process consists of three rounds, where the first two rounds will iterate and identify items to be included in the final Delphi survey for consensus ratings. Stage 3 consists of consensus meetings to review and aggregate the Delphi survey responses leading to Stage 4 where we will produce a reusable toolkit to facilitate participatory development of future bespoke LGBTQI+ adapted data collection, harmonisation and use for data-driven AI applications specifically in mental health care settings. Ethics and Dissemination: The PARQAIR-MH aims to deliver a toolkit that will help to ensure that the specific needs of LGBTQI+ communities are accounted for in mental health applications of data-driven technologies. Participants in the Delphi process will be recruited by snowball and opportunistic sampling via professional networks and social media (but not by direct approach to healthcare service users, patients, specific clinical services or via clinicians' caseloads). Participants will not be required to share personal narratives and experiences of healthcare or treatment for any condition. Before agreeing to participate, people will be given information about the issues considered to be in-scope for the Delphi (e.g. developing best practices and methods for collecting and harmonizing sensitive characteristics data; developing guidelines for data use/re-use) alongside specific risks of unintended harm from participating that can be reasonably anticipated.

Hurlemann,2024.0,2024-04-15,JMIR Formative Research,1,Semantic Scholar,"BACKGROUND
Depression is a serious mental health condition that can have a profound impact on the individual experiencing the disorder and those providing care. While psychotherapy and medication can be effective, there are gaps in current approaches, particularly in outpatient care. This phase is often associated with a high risk of relapse and readmission, and patients often report a lack of support. Socially interactive agents represent an innovative approach to the provision of assistance. Often powered by artificial intelligence, these virtual agents can interact socially and elicit humanlike emotions. In health care, they are used as virtual therapeutic assistants to fill gaps in outpatient aftercare.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to explore the expectations of patients with depression and health care professionals by conducting a qualitative survey. Our analysis focused on research questions related to the appearance and role of the assistant, the assistant-patient interaction (time of interaction, skills and abilities of the assistant, and modes of interaction) and the therapist-assistant interaction.


METHODS
A 2-part qualitative study was conducted to explore the perspectives of the 2 groups (patients and care providers). In the first step, care providers (n=30) were recruited during a regional offline meeting. After a short presentation, they were given a link and were asked to complete a semistructured web-based questionnaire. Next, patients (n=20) were recruited from a clinic and were interviewed in a semistructured face-to-face interview.


RESULTS
The survey findings suggested that the assistant should be a multimodal communicator (voice, facial expressions, and gestures) and counteract negative self-evaluation. Most participants preferred a female assistant or wanted the option to choose the gender. In total, 24 (80%) health care professionals wanted a selectable option, while patients exhibited a marked preference for a female or diverse assistant. Regrading patient-assistant interaction, the assistant was seen as a proactive recipient of information, and the patient as a passive one. Gaps in aftercare could be filled by the unlimited availability of the assistant. However, patients should retain their autonomy to avoid dependency. The monitoring of health status was viewed positively by both groups. A biofeedback function was desired to detect early warning signs of disease. When appropriate to the situation, a sense of humor in the assistant was desirable. The desired skills of the assistant can be summarized as providing structure and emotional support, especially warmth and competence to build trust. Consistency was important for the caregiver to appear authentic. Regarding the assistant-care provider interaction, 3 key areas were identified: objective patient status measurement, emergency suicide prevention, and an information tool and decision support system for health care professionals.


CONCLUSIONS
Overall, the survey conducted provides innovative guidelines for the development of virtual therapeutic assistants to fill the gaps in patient aftercare.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a32f3f88f4be0e31d93a21473b7eb2f437e8f24,None

For the first objective, users who completed two PHQ-9 self-reported assessments (n = 51) were grouped as either higher engaged users (n = 28) or lower engaged users (n = 23) based on their number of active session-days with the CA between two screenings. A non-parametric Mann–Whitney test (M–W) and non-parametric Common Language effect size was used to evaluate group differences in self-reported depressive symptoms. For the second objective, a Braun and Clarke thematic analysis was used to identify engagement behavior with the CA for the top quartile of higher engaged users (n = 10 of 51). Feedback on the app and demographic information was also explored. Results Results revealed a significant reduction in self-reported depressive symptoms among the higher engaged user group compared to lower engaged user group (M–W p = .004) with a high effect size (CL = 0.736). Furthermore, the top themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis revealed users expressed concerns, hopes, need for support, reframing their thoughts and expressing their victories and gratitude. Conclusion These findings provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness and engagement and comfort of using this AI-based emotionally intelligent mobile app to support mental health and wellbeing across a range of maternal events and experiences.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09243eb36a129e85b6c18bcc637a095270ad5d09,None

The objective of this paper is to complement current research on the ethics of AI for mental health by proposing a holistic, ethical, and epistemic analysis of CAI adoption. First, we focus on the question of whether CAI is rather a tool or an agent. This question serves as a framework for the subsequent ethical analysis of CAI focusing on topics of (self-) knowledge, (self-)understanding, and relationships. Second, we propose further conceptual and ethical analysis regarding human-AI interaction and argue that CAI cannot be considered as an equal partner in a conversation as is the case with a human therapist.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging.

Gunathilaka; A. d’Elia; Simon George Morris; Sheila M Greenfield,2025.0,2025-01-31,Journal of Medical Internet Research,0,Semantic Scholar,"Background Managing multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) is complex. Clinical management guidelines are typically focused on individual conditions and lack a robust evidence base for patients with MLTC. MLTC management is largely delivered in primary care, where health care professionals (HCPs) have identified the need for more holistic yet efficient models of care that can address patients’ medical, pharmacological, social, and mental health needs. Artificial intelligence (AI) has proven effective in tackling complex, data-driven challenges in various fields, presenting significant opportunities for MLTC care. However, its role in managing patients with multifaceted psychosocial needs remains underexplored. The implementation of AI tools in this context introduces opportunities for innovation and challenges related to clinical appropriateness, trust, and ethical considerations. Understanding HCPs’ experiences of MLTC management and the factors influencing their attitudes toward using AI in complex clinical decision-making is crucial for successful implementation. Objective We aimed to explore the perspectives of primary care HCPs on managing MLTC and their attitudes toward using AI tools to support clinical decision-making in MLTC care. Methods In total, 20 HCPs, including general practitioners, geriatricians, nurses, and pharmacists, were interviewed. A patient case study was used to explore how an AI tool might alter the way in which participants approach clinical decision-making with a patient with MLTC. We derived concepts inductively from the interview transcripts and structured them according to the 5 categories of the model by Buck exploring determinants of attitudes toward AI. These included the concerns and expectations that contributed to the minimum requirements for HCPs to consider using an AI decision-making tool, as well as the individual characteristics and environmental influences determining their attitudes. Results HCPs’ perspectives on managing MLTC were grouped into three main themes: (1) balancing multiple competing factors, including accounting for patients’ social circumstances; (2) managing polypharmacy; and (3) working beyond single-condition guidelines. HCPs typically expected that AI tools would improve the safety and quality of clinical decision-making. However, they expressed concerns about the impact on the therapeutic clinician-patient relationship that is fundamental to the care of patients with MLTC. The key prerequisites for clinicians adopting AI tools in this context included improving public and patient trust in AI, saving time and integrating with existing systems, and ensuring that the rationale behind a recommendation is apparent to enable a final decision made by an experienced human clinician. Conclusions This is the first study to examine the attitudes of HCPs toward using AI decision-making tools in the context of managing MLTC. HCPs were optimistic about AI’s potential to improve decision-making safety and quality but emphasized that the human touch remains essential for patients with complex needs. We identified critical requirements for AI adoption, including addressing patients’ perceptions, time efficiency, and the preservation of clinician and patient autonomy.

Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have thoroughly transformed health care–related mobile apps, offered more effective mental health support, and alleviated the psychological stress that may have emerged during the pandemic. Early reviews outlined the use of mobile apps for dealing with depression and insomnia separately. However, there is now an urgent need for a systematic evaluation of mobile apps that address both depression and insomnia to reveal new applications and research gaps. Objective This study aims to systematically review and evaluate mobile apps targeting depression and insomnia, highlighting their features, effectiveness, and gaps in the current research. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2017 and 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies that (1) focused on mobile apps addressing both depression and insomnia, (2) involved young people or adult participants, and (3) provided data on treatment efficacy. Data extraction was independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Title and abstract screening, as well as full-text screening, were completed in duplicate. Data were extracted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer, and risk of bias assessments were completed accordingly. Results Of the initial 383 studies we found, 365 were excluded after title, abstract screening, and removal of duplicates. Eventually, 18 full-text articles met our criteria and underwent full-text screening. The analysis revealed that mobile apps related to depression and insomnia were primarily utilized for early detection, assessment, and screening (n=5 studies); counseling and psychological support (n=3 studies); and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; n=10 studies). Among the 10 studies related to depression, our findings showed that chatbots demonstrated significant advantages in improving depression symptoms, a promising development in the field. Additionally, 2 studies evaluated the effectiveness of mobile apps as alternative interventions for depression and sleep, further expanding the potential applications of this technology.

Recent advances in understanding people's emotions expressed through verbal and non-verbal communication are particularly noteworthy in the clinical context for the assessment of patients’ health and well-being. Facial expression recognition (FER) plays an important and vital role in healthcare, providing communication with a patient’s feelings and allowing the assessment and monitoring of mental and physical health conditions. However, the subtle and rapid nature of facial expressions poses a challenge to swift recognition and interpretation. Previous research collaboration between North Middlesex Hospital and the GMPR group has demonstrated for the first time that human recognised patterns of facial action units can be used to predict admission to intensive care. This thesis shows that automatic machine learning methods may predict health deterioration accurately and robustly, independent of human subjective assessment. Methods are developed to create a facial database mimicking the underlying muscular structure of the face, whose Action Unit motions can then be transferred to human face images, thus displaying animated expressions of interest. To detect and recognize expressions, five models are proposed and tested. The first model combined face detection method with a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), using raw generated data coordinates as input. Results show 99.74% accuracy in predicting patient deterioration. The second model combines 1D-CNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with different data pre-processing methods with an overall accuracy of 99.89%. The third and fourth models, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine methods yield accuracies of 100% and 60% respectively. Finally, the Transformer model yields a low accuracy of 20%. The main contributions to knowledge from this thesis can be summarized as 1) the generation of visual datasets mimicking real-life samples of facial expressions indicating health deterioration; 2) to improve understanding and communication with patients at risk of deterioration through facial expression analysis, and 3) developing state-of-the-art models to recognize such facial expressions based on simulated facial expressions. Hence, the significance of the investigation and prediction model designs is to directly support clinical systems in detecting and assessing early signs of health deterioration directly from the analysis of patients’ facial expressions. As such, the outcomes of this PhD thesis may help to improve assessment of health deterioration by introducing real-time, health trend analysis and early warning systems to support timely interventions.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e15d27d4e9d85d05c8cc628492e587cb3359a0d,Transformer

With already millions of users worldwide, CAI is likely to change the landscape of psychological help. Most researchers agree that existing CAIs are not “digital therapists” and using them is not a substitute for psychotherapy delivered by a human. But if they are not therapists, what are they, and what role can they play in mental health care? To answer these questions, we appeal to two well-established and widely discussed concepts: cognitive and affective artifacts. Cognitive artifacts are artificial devices contributing functionally to the performance of a cognitive task. Affective artifacts are objects which have the capacity to alter subjects’ affective state. We argue that therapeutic CAIs are a kind of cognitive-affective artifacts which contribute to positive therapeutic change by (i) simulating a (quasi-)therapeutic interaction, (ii) supporting the performance of cognitive tasks, and (iii) altering the affective condition of their users. This sheds new light on why virtually all existing mental health CAIs implement principles and techniques of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy — a therapeutic orientation according to which affective change and, ultimately, positive therapeutic change is mediated by cognitive change. Simultaneously, it allows us to conceptualize better the potential and limitations of applying these technologies in therapy.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/493ed01a70773171eec96996208441ded4030932,None

Clark,2025.0,2025-02-17,arXiv.org,7,Semantic Scholar,"How we should design and interact with social artificial intelligence depends on the socio-relational role the AI is meant to emulate or occupy. In human society, relationships such as teacher-student, parent-child, neighbors, siblings, or employer-employee are governed by specific norms that prescribe or proscribe cooperative functions including hierarchy, care, transaction, and mating. These norms shape our judgments of what is appropriate for each partner. For example, workplace norms may allow a boss to give orders to an employee, but not vice versa, reflecting hierarchical and transactional expectations. As AI agents and chatbots powered by large language models are increasingly designed to serve roles analogous to human positions - such as assistant, mental health provider, tutor, or romantic partner - it is imperative to examine whether and how human relational norms should extend to human-AI interactions. Our analysis explores how differences between AI systems and humans, such as the absence of conscious experience and immunity to fatigue, may affect an AI's capacity to fulfill relationship-specific functions and adhere to corresponding norms. This analysis, which is a collaborative effort by philosophers, psychologists, relationship scientists, ethicists, legal experts, and AI researchers, carries important implications for AI systems design, user behavior, and regulation. While we accept that AI systems can offer significant benefits such as increased availability and consistency in certain socio-relational roles, they also risk fostering unhealthy dependencies or unrealistic expectations that could spill over into human-human relationships. We propose that understanding and thoughtfully shaping (or implementing) suitable human-AI relational norms will be crucial for ensuring that human-AI interactions are ethical, trustworthy, and favorable to human well-being.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64c2bb56fe73814e4ebc9995187943fc0256a88f,Large Language Model

Chooralil; Niby Babu,2025.0,2025-03-01,ICTACT Journal on Data Science and Machine Learning,0,Semantic Scholar,"The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is transforming patient care by enabling real-time monitoring and personalized treatment. Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a vital role in identifying emotional states, which can improve mental health diagnosis and patient engagement. However, existing FER systems face limitations in accuracy and responsiveness due to insufficient data processing capabilities and lack of adaptive learning models. This study proposes an IoT-driven FER system using a Convolutional Neural Network with Attention Mechanism (CNN-AM) to enhance emotion detection accuracy and system adaptability. IoT devices, including wearable sensors and smart cameras, capture real-time facial data, which is processed using the CNN-AM model to identify emotional states. The attention mechanism improves the model''''s ability to focus on critical facial features, reducing false detection rates. The system was tested on the FER-2013 dataset, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.6%, outperforming existing methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and ResNet by 3.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Results demonstrate that the proposed model enhances both detection speed and accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for personalized healthcare in Industry 5.0.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2abc8c161fd4b53ae84a774cb02ee3b93cf24f52,None

Interact.,8,Semantic Scholar,"Social service providers play a vital role in the developmental outcomes of underprivileged youth as they transition into adulthood. Educators, mental health professionals, juvenile justice officers, and child welfare caseworkers often have first-hand knowledge of the trials uniquely faced by these vulnerable youth and are charged with mitigating harmful risks, such as mental health challenges, child abuse, drug use, and sex trafficking. Yet, less is known about whether or how social service providers assess and mitigate theonline risk experiences of youth under their care. Therefore, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program, we conducted interviews with 37 social service providers (SSPs) who work with underprivileged youth to determine what (if any) online risks are most concerning to them given their role in youth protection, how they assess or become aware of these online risk experiences, and whether they see value in the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution for online risk detection. Overall, online sexual risks (e.g., sexual grooming and abuse) and cyberbullying were the most salient concern across all social service domains, especially when these experiences crossed the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds. Yet, SSPs had to rely heavily on youth self-reports to know whether and when online risks occurred, which required building a trusting relationship with youth; otherwise, SSPs became aware only after a formal investigation had been launched. Therefore, most SSPs found value in the potential for using AI as an early detection system and to monitor youth, but they were concerned that such a solution would not be feasible due to a lack of resources to adequately respond to online incidences, access to the necessary digital trace data (e.g., social media), context, and concerns about violating the trust relationships they built with youth. Thus, such automated risk detection systems should be designed and deployed with caution, as their implementation could cause youth to mistrust adults, thereby limiting the receipt of necessary guidance and support. We add to the bodies of research on adolescent online safety and the benefits and challenges of leveraging algorithmic systems in the public sector.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f42f2e756bcf3683431af97f36527231117edcda,None

The Impact of Comorbidity Patterns on Clinical Outcomes in Heart Failure: A Machine Learning-Based Cluster Analysis,Liu B.,2026,American Journal of Cardiology,"Heart failure (HF) is a major global health burden, and complex comorbidity patterns can worsen clinical outcomes and complicate patient care. This study aimed to identify distinct comorbidity-based clusters among HF patients and evaluate their associations with short-term clinical outcomes. We analyzed electronic health records from 1,010,573 HF patients in China between 2021 and 2024 and classified into 5 distinct clusters using the Clustering Large Applications (CLARA) algorithm. Cluster 5, characterized by the highest comorbidity burden, was associated with an increased risk of 30-day readmission (adjusted OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.25 to 1.33), whereas Clusters 2 and 3 demonstrated lower risks compared with the reference group. XGBoost achieved the best predictive performance among multiple machine learning models (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.76; Brier score 0.17). Age and Charlson Comorbidity Index score were the most influential predictors, and features derived from the comorbidity clusters provided additional predictive value. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate substantial heterogeneity among HF patients, highlight the clinical relevance of comorbidity-based clustering, and suggest its potential to improve risk stratification and personalized care strategies.",10.1016/j.amjcard.2025.09.044,0,Scopus,105019979100,2-s2.0-105019979100,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019979100

Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Predicting Mental Health States from Digital Media Content,Haoues M.,2026,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"The increasing integration of technologies into our daily activities offers a great opportunity to enhance individual quality of life. However, it can also have negative effects, which can lead to mental health issues and raise the risk of suicide. In fact, mental health issues among adolescents and young adults have risen significantly in recent years. Therefore, the early detection of these issues is crucial to reduce the risk of suicide. Digital media platforms offer an anonymous space, allowing users to express themselves on various topics, including their mental health status. This paper investigates the use of machine learning and deep learning models to predict mental health states and identify individuals with suicide ideation. For this purpose, we propose analyzing digital media content, such as posts and tweets, collected from two distinct datasets: SuicideIdeation Tweet and SuicideDetection. The best results were achieved by combining RNN and LSTM models in a hybrid RNN-LSTM architecture, yielding accuracy rates of 91.34% and 92.04%, with AUC values of 95.26% and 95.94% for the SuicideIdeation Tweet and SuicideDetection datasets, respectively.",10.1007/978-3-031-93598-5_12,0,Scopus,105011694320,2-s2.0-105011694320,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105011694320
The secrets of medical students’ psychological resilience: a dual perspective of machine learning and path analysis,Su W.,2026,International Journal of Medical Informatics,"Background: As future healthcare workers, if medical students can enhance their psychological resilience, it will help them better cope with the pressures and challenges of their future work, thereby improving the overall mental health of healthcare personnel. We aim to identify high-risk individuals among medical students with low psychological resilience and to explore the potential mechanisms for improving psychological resilience. Methods: We developed an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model using basic characteristics and health behavior information of medical students, and compared its performance with that of Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) models. Additionally, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpretability analysis of the model. After identifying the key predictive variables, we conducted mediation analysis to explore intervention pathways for enhancing psychological resilience among medical students. Results: Among the four machine learning models, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best predictive performance, with an accuracy of 0.822 (95%CI: 0.775–0.866), an AUC value of 0.856 (95%CI: 0.799–0.905), sensitivity of 0.609 (95%CI: 0.492–0.722), specificity of 0.902 (95%CI: 0.857–0.943), and an F1 score of 0.700 (95%CI: 0.547–0.739). Smartphone addiction and sleep disturbances are negatively correlated with psychological resilience in medical students, while perceived social support is positively correlated with it. Additionally, smartphone addiction and sleep disturbances can serve as either independent mediators or chain mediators between perceived social support and psychological resilience in medical students. Limitations: We have only analyzed the dataset from a single institution and have not yet validated our model on an external dataset, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, some important predictors of Psychological Resilience may have been overlooked, potentially affecting the model's performance. Conclusions: Perceived social support, smartphone addiction, and sleep disturbance are important factors in predicting medical students’ psychological resilience. Additionally, perceived social support can directly influence psychological resilience, as well as indirectly affect it through smartphone addiction and sleep disturbance.",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.106111,0,Scopus,105014924955,2-s2.0-105014924955,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014924955
The Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools in Analyzing the Impact of Social Media on Adolescents’ Mental Health,Mohammed R.N.,2026,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"This study uses AI tools to explore social media use data and adolescent mental health outcomes. Using a mixed-method analysis of sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, we examined public social media data from adolescents aged 13–18 years on three major platforms: Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. The study applied VADER and BERT for sentiment analysis, as well as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms on predictive approaches. The analysis showed that 42% of analyzed posts were negative, compared to a significant increase to 65% in the presence of keywords related to mental health. Children scoring behavioral pattern analysis as both active posters (more than 10 posts per week) but passive consumers were significantly more likely to demonstrate markers of emotional distress. Negative sentiment posts attracted 35% more engagement than neutral or positive content, with the risk of entrenched negative behavioral patterns. The predictive models were able to identify the mental health risk factor with great accuracy, achieving 85% accuracy using Random Forest and 83% using SVM. Analysis over time revealed elevated negativity during periods of high stress such as examination, indicating that looming environmental triggers could contribute to psychological malaise. This study will provide the evidence-based required to formulate early intervention strategies and mental health support systems. This study is the first to use social media behavior to assess in real time if AI tools can monitor and predict risk of mental illness in adolescents, together with the implications for balanced interventions that take into account social media benefits as well as risks.",10.1007/978-3-031-90893-4_76,0,Scopus,105020567895,2-s2.0-105020567895,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020567895
Discovery of factors associated with smartphone addiction among high school adolescents: Using machine learning and network analysis,Li Z.,2026,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background and aims: Nowadays, smartphone addiction (SA) has become a widespread issue; however, research specifically targeting high school adolescents remains limited. To address this gap, this study aimed to identify important predictive factors of SA among high school students using machine learning and to explore the relationships among these factors through network analysis, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for targeted interventions. Methods: A total of 14,036 high school students aged 15–18 years (M = 16.40) were included for model training and internal validation. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was applied to evaluate the importance of 20 candidate variables, ranked using SHAP values, from which the top nine predictors were selected. Network analysis was then employed to examine the connections among these predictors. Results: The XGBoost model achieved the highest predictive performance among tested approaches. Network analysis revealed that anxiety was the most central factor, showing positive associations with interpersonal sensitivity and mood swings. Conclusions: XGBoost combined with network analysis is an effective approach for identifying and exploring SA-related factors among high school adolescents. The identified predictors provide valuable insights for designing targeted and evidence-based interventions for SA in this population.",10.1016/j.jad.2025.120096,0,Scopus,105014333526,2-s2.0-105014333526,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014333526
Predicting Problematic Internet Use Severity: A Machine Learning Approach Using Physical Activity and Behavioral Data,Karigar A.,2026,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"Problematic internet use (PIU) is a growing concern, especially among adolescents, with significant impacts on mental and physical health. This study aims to predict the severity of PIU, measured by the Severity Impairment Index (SII), using a combination of physical activity, demographic, and behavioral data. Machine learning models, including XGBoost, CatBoost, TabNet, and LightGBM, were employed to classify participants into SII categories: none, mild, moderate, and severe. Data were sourced from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset, which includes accelerometer data, internet usage, fitness assessments, and physiological measures from over 3000 participants aged 5–22 years. Key feature engineering steps included creating interaction terms (e.g., BMI × Age) and applying autoencoders for dimensionality reduction on the high-dimensional actigraphy data. The results indicated that CatBoost performed best in predicting minority SII categories, handling imbalanced data effectively. XGBoost and LightGBM demonstrated stable performance, while TabNet provided interpretability but lower overall predictive power. Evaluation metrics, particularly Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK), were used to assess model performance, with QWK offering insights into the ordinal nature of misclassifications. This study highlights the value of combining physical activity and behavioral data in predicting PIU severity. The findings underscore the potential of machine learning in identifying individuals at risk for severe PIU and suggest avenues for future interventions to reduce the negative impacts of excessive internet use.",10.1007/978-981-96-7514-2_41,0,Scopus,105020264007,2-s2.0-105020264007,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020264007
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with borderline personality disorder: Real-world insights from a retrospective observational study,White C.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Current treatment modalities demonstrate variable effectiveness across patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Here, we describe the presenting clinical characteristics of patients with BPD based on approximately 20 years of real-world data. Methods: This retrospective, observational study was based on de-identified MindLinc electronic health records of individuals (aged ≥12 years with ≥1 diagnosis of BPD) receiving mental healthcare between 1999 and 2020 across 15 US states using the NeuroBlu database (vRel21R2). Demographic and clinical characteristics at first recorded BPD diagnosis (index date), baseline (index date ±14 days), and in the 12 months prior to diagnosis were described. BPD symptoms were derived by natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured clinician-documented mental state examination (MSE) data. Results: Across the 13,444 patients analysed at baseline (mean [SD] age 33 [12.8] years; 83.6 % female; 97.5 % with psychiatric comorbidities), the most frequent comorbid psychiatric conditions were major depressive disorder (45.7 %), substance use disorder (34.6 %) and post-traumatic stress disorder (29.2 %). Emotional dysregulation (35.8 %) and suicidal intent/ideation (31.3 %) were the most frequent NLP-derived BPD symptoms. Emotional dysregulation was more common in older patients, whereas suicidal intent/ideation/attempt/self-injury were more prevalent in younger patients. Mean (SD) length of hospitalisation was 2.9 (4.2) days, with 46.5 % of patients requiring ≥1 psychiatric hospitalisation. At diagnosis, 67.7 % of patients were prescribed pharmacological treatment, including antidepressants (51.1 %), second-generation antipsychotics (34.0 %) and anticonvulsants (33.7 %). Conclusion: BPD symptoms varied according to patient characteristics, including age and gender. These insights may enable patient-specific treatment planning in the future and improve therapeutic outcomes.",10.1016/j.jad.2025.120008,0,Scopus,105013659904,2-s2.0-105013659904,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013659904
Exploring the preferences of college students for horticultural therapy activities based on a new classification framework,Sun Y.,2025,Scientific Reports,"To reveal college students' preferences for types of horticultural therapy (HT) activities and the influence ofbiopsychosocial factors, an online questionnaire with AI-generated illustrations was administered to assess 622respondents’ preferences for 21 HT activities and their biopsychosocial characteristics. Confirmatory factor analysisconfirmed a four-dimensional model consisting of Making (MA), Planting (PL), Active Perception (AP), and PassivePerception (PP) with good fit and reliability. The preference means ranked as MA (M = 4.065) > AP (M = 3.829) > PL(M = 3.797) > PP (M = 3.646). Biologically, females exhibit a significantly stronger preference for MA (t = − 4.32) and PP(t = − 2.18) compared to males, as evidenced by t-test results. Psychologically, natural connectedness was strongly andpositively correlated with preferences for all types of HT (r = 0.522–0.648), whereas psychological well-being showed onlya weak positive correlation with PL (r = 0.146) through correlation analysis. Individuals with more experience in HT showeda significantly higher preference for PL (F = 6.80), AP (F = 8.42), and PP (F = 3.81) according to ANOVA results. Socially, theANOVA results indicated that there was no significant difference in the preferences for HT types among students ofdifferent educational backgrounds. This study validates a novel framework for classifying HT activities grounded inhuman-plant interactions and, by examining the influence of biopsychosocial factors on preferences for HT, providesstronger evidence for personalized design of HT programs tailored to college students.",10.1038/s41598-025-16589-y,0,Scopus,105014926171,2-s2.0-105014926171,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014926171
A randomized controlled trial of Internet-delivered guided and unguided cognitive behaviour therapy for treating depression and anxiety in UK university students: study protocol for the Nurture-U Internet CBT trial,Watkins E.R.,2025,Trials,"Background: Tackling poor mental health in university students is a priority in higher education. Although major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are highly prevalent among university students and predict impaired university and later life outcomes, most students do not receive evidence-based treatment. Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy (iCBT) is increasingly offered to UK university students in guided or unguided formats. Our aim is to compare the effects of guided versus unguided scalable iCBT for university students with elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety and to investigate the feasibility of creating individual treatment rules (ITR) to predict for whom which variant of iCBT is more effective as well as for whom neither is effective. Methods: An online single-blind, two-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial to examine symptoms of depression and anxiety across 3 months in university students aged over 16 who screen into the study with self-reported high levels of anxiety (GAD-7 > 9) and/or depression (PHQ-9 > 9). Eligible participants will be randomized to guided transdiagnostic iCBT supported by a psychological wellbeing practitioner or to the same transdiagnostic iCBT content as unguided self-help. In total, 720 participants with no current bipolar disorder or psychosis will be recruited from UK universities. Assessments will take place at baseline (pre-randomization) and 3 months post-randomization. Primary endpoints and outcomes are self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms at 3-month follow-up, adjusting for baseline scores. Well-being, health-related quality of life, functioning and academic outcomes are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events, and potentially mediating variables will be monitored. We will use machine learning to estimate heterogeneity of treatment effects and develop an ITR to optimize the allocation of students to either unguided or guided iCBT. Discussion: The trial aims to provide a better understanding of the relative benefits of guided and unguided iCBT for anxiety and depression in university students with considerable implications for treatment coverage and service planning and delivery. We will provide innovative information to optimize treatment assignment, guide university mental health treatment planning and support evidence-based and scalable interventions for the most common mental health problems in university students.

Utilizing CBNet to effectively address and combat cyberbullying among university students on social media platforms,Abbasi I.A.,2025,Scientific Reports,"Cyberbullying can profoundly impact individuals’ mental health, leading to increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and social isolation. Psychological research suggests that cyberbullying victims may experience long-term psychological consequences, including diminished self-esteem and academic performance. The widespread use of social media platforms among university students has raised major concerns over cyberbullying, which can have detrimental effects on student mental well-being and academic performance. The purpose of this study is to develop Cyberbullying Network (CBNet), a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model, and a comprehensive dataset to enhance cyberbullying detection accuracy and real-world applicability in student social media interactions. We designed CBNet, a CNN-based model for detecting cyberbullying among student social media groups. We developed a comprehensive dataset collected from several social media platforms popular among university students. Our results demonstrate that CBNet notably outperforms both the traditional machine learning approaches and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based model and presents an outstanding value of precision, recall, and F1-score overall, with an Area Under the ROC Curve significantly higher than 0.99. Combined with the fact that the issue of cyberbullying always remains relevant, these results suggest the high feasibility of our suggested approach to the detection of incidents. Given our results, CBNet could be used as a preventative tool for educators, administrators, and community managers to combat cyberbullying behavior and make the online community safer and more welcoming for students. This work suggests the high importance of advanced machine learning approaches to real-world social problems and contributes to the creation of greater digital well-being in university students’ communities. By employing CBNet, institutions can take proactive measures to mitigate the harmful effects of cyberbullying and cultivate a positive online culture conducive to student success and flourishing.",10.1038/s41598-025-09091-y,0,Scopus,105010637575,2-s2.0-105010637575,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010637575
Comparing ChatGPT and validated questionnaires in assessing loneliness and online social support among college students: a cross-sectional study,Gu J.,2025,Scientific Reports,"The capability of ChatGPT to understand and generate human-readable text has prompted the investigation of its potential as mental health assessment tools. This study aims to explore the validity of ChatGPT in assessing loneliness and online social support among college students by comparing scoring consistency between ChatGPT and the validated questionnaires. This was a cross-sectional study between June and August 2024. We pre-trained ChatGPT-4 based on the validated University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-6 (ULS-6) and Chinese Youth Version of the Online Social Support Scale (OSSS-CS), creating a structured interview questionnaire. Participants were invited to complete both the ChatGPT-created questionnaire and the validated questionnaires. We used Spearman correlation analysis, Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), and Bland–Altman plots to assess the agreement between the scores from ChatGPT and the validated questionnaires. In addition, we evaluated ceiling and floor effects. A total of 216 college students participated the survey. The results demonstrated a good consistency between the scores obtained from ChatGPT and the validated questionnaires, with ICC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.75–0.85, p < 0.001) for ULS-6 and 0.95 (95% CI 0.94–0.96, p < 0.001) for OSSS-CS. The Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.64 (p < 0.001) for ULS-6 and 0.89 (p < 0.001) for OSSS-CS, indicating a moderate correlation. No ceiling or floor effects were observed. The ChatGPT-created questionnaire demonstrated acceptable consistency with the validated questionnaires. Future studies can further explore the performance of ChatGPT in different populations and domains, as well as how to integrate it with validated questionnaires to enhance the accessibility of assessments.",10.1038/s41598-025-06358-2,0,Scopus,105009736242,2-s2.0-105009736242,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009736242
AI-Driven Mobile Application for Self-Monitoring Personalized Premenstrual Symptoms and Risk Assessment of Depressive Crises in Female University Students,Nuankaew P.,2025,Journal of Applied Data Sciences,"Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and depressive symptoms are common concerns for female university students, often triggered by hormonal fluctuations before menstruation. These conditions can severely impact academic performance, interpersonal relationships, and overall well-being, particularly when symptoms escalate into severe depressive episodes. Even though the prevalence, awareness, and self-management strategies among students are on the rise, they remain limited, particularly in cultural contexts where women's health and emotional well-being receive little attention. This study presents the development of an AI-driven mobile application designed to facilitate personalized tracking of premenstrual symptoms and assess the risk of depressive episodes. The application integrates machine learning models trained on self-reported psychological and physiological data, using validated instruments such as DASS-21 and PSST-A. The research adopted a mixed-methods approach, involving survey-based symptom identification, model training and validation, system design, and user satisfaction evaluation. This research contributes to the development of artificial intelligence-assisted self-care technology for the purpose of monitoring personal health and taking preventative psychological measures. The findings indicate that the application that was developed is beneficial in terms of forecasting the likelihood of someone suffering from depression and fostering self-awareness regarding mental health among college students. Considering this, the system has the potential to develop into a useful tool for providing aid to female students attending universities.",10.47738/jads.v6i4.881,0,Scopus,105016559925,2-s2.0-105016559925,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016559925
Mental health of university students twenty months after the beginning of the full-scale Russian-Ukrainian war,Polyvianaia M.,2025,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Russia’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 led to an increase of anxiety and depressive states, psychosomatic manifestations, and a tendency to abuse alcohol and psychoactive substances in the population. The aim of this paper is to examine the mental health burden among university students twenty months after war and to identify risk and protective factors for mental health problems. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Ukrainian students in October 2023 (n = 1398). The online survey included sociodemographic data collection, evaluation of psychological well-being and measured depression, anxiety, PTSD symptoms and insomnia. Normality of included variables was verified by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. An independent-samples t-test, Mann–Whitney U-test, χ2 test and analysis of variance were used to compare the data. Differences in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 levels based on sociodemographic characteristics were analyzed using ANOVA. Correlation between variables was calculated with Pearson correlation, adjusted with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. To develop the predictive model the XGBoost algorithm was employed, additionally, the SHAP algorithm was utilized. Results: Symptoms of PTSD, as well as moderate and severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, were reported by 48.1%, 34.1%, 33.6%, and 19.3% of students, respectively. The severity of these symptoms varied based on factors such as sex, age, prior trauma experiences, and living conditions. Additionally, the type of relocation (within Ukraine or abroad) significantly influenced mental health outcomes. A majority of participants (68.5%) reported the experience of war-related traumatic events. Factors linked to higher depression symptom scores included lower initial well-being, greater social media use, female gender, exposure to multiple traumatic events, experiences of assault or sexual violence, the loss of a loved one, pre-existing and ongoing mental health treatment during the war, and the use of psychotropic medications. Conclusions: Ukrainian university students face a significant mental health burden due to the ongoing war, with high rates of reported PTSD, anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of tailored mental health interventions through different stakeholders that take into account individual needs, past experiences, burdens and social media usage.",10.1186/s12888-025-06654-1,1,Scopus,105000113467,2-s2.0-105000113467,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000113467
Modeling student satisfaction in online learning using random forest,Li J.,2025,Scientific Reports,"The rapid expansion of online education has intensified the need to investigate the multifactorial determinants of university students’ satisfaction with digital learning platforms. While prior studies have often examined technical or pedagogical components in isolation, limited attention has been paid to their interaction with students’ psychological well-being, particularly through nonlinear mechanisms. To address this gap, this study employs a Random Forest–based framework to model satisfaction using a multidimensional dataset from 782 university students. Measured variables included platform usability, content quality, emotional experience, and self-regulation. Data were standardized via Z-scores, and class imbalance was addressed using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results identified platform stability and content update frequency as the most influential predictors, with AUC values exceeding 0.95 across most satisfaction levels. Psychological factors—especially perceived enjoyment and emotional stability—also contributed significantly. Partial dependence plots revealed threshold and saturation effects, highlighting complex nonlinear patterns missed by traditional linear models. However, performance declined in predicting low-satisfaction cases (AUC = 0.70), likely due to subgroup underrepresentation. This study contributes theoretically by integrating cognitive-affective dimensions, methodologically by demonstrating the utility of machine learning in modeling nonlinear interactions, and practically by providing actionable insights for platform optimization. Future research should incorporate additional psychological constructs, such as cognitive load and resilience, and apply the model across more diverse learner populations to enhance generalizability and support inclusive, user-centered digital education.",10.1038/s41598-025-06686-3,0,Scopus,105010166583,2-s2.0-105010166583,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010166583
"Cancers missed, women dismissed yet persist: natural language processing of online forums",Ulanday K.T.,2025,Breast Cancer Research,"Objective: To identify gaps and delays in the detection of early onset cancer. Methods: We examined firsthand experiences shared on an online discussion board hosted by the Young Survival Coalition—an advocacy group for young adults diagnosed with breast cancer—spanning the years 2009 to 2019. We used natural language processing to detect codes: “first signs and symptoms,” “steps to diagnosis,” “healthcare interactions,” “patient-provider-system feelings,” and “staging/type.” In the training dataset, we used qualitative content analysis to code text from 750 of the forum’s 571,914 posts. We developed and evaluated automated approaches to quantify the proportion of codes in all posts. Lastly, we qualitatively reviewed the classified posts to identify areas for improvement along the clinical pathway. Results: The vast majority (81%) of young adults self-detected their breast cancer rather than the cancer being detected through a clinical breast exam. Young adults (70%) were dissatisfied with their care because they encountered delays at three crossroads along the clinical pathway: 1) whether the clinician ordered tests or dismissed the individual as too young; 2) whether imaging modalities were sensitive or not; 3) whether a biopsy confirmed or missed the cancer. Mental health challenges and parenting pressures compounded these delays. True positive cases who experienced these delays strongly encouraged their peers to self-advocate, persist and insist on further testing until diagnosed accurately. Conclusion: Dismissal and delays in diagnosis of early onset breast cancer mean potentially worse prognosis since later stage cancers are more aggressive with fewer treatment options. The perspectives from survivors highlight the need for more research informing early detection in young adults by considering breast awareness, use of MRI and ultrasound, biopsy referrals for exhibited breast symptoms in the absence of positive imaging, and sociomedical support for individuals in their role as current or future parent.",10.1186/s13058-025-01985-z,0,Scopus,105005099582,2-s2.0-105005099582,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005099582
Digital positive affect intervention (PAI) versus self-monitoring placebo in the treatment of anxiety and depression: a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT),Zainal N.H.,2025,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders are highly prevalent, common mental disorders globally, but access to efficacious, high-reach treatment remains scarce. Although digital cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) demonstrate efficacy and scalability, they remain limited in enhancing positive affect (PA) and reward processing, which are core deficits underlying anhedonia, a key transdiagnostic symptom. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluates a locally tailored, guidance-on-demand, low-intensity Digital Positive Affect Intervention (PAI) developed to improve positive valence systems while alleviating symptoms in adults and university students in Singapore. Methods: This single-blind, two-arm, pragmatic RCT will recruit 1,200 community-dwelling adults with mild-to-moderate symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 allocation to either the Digital PAI or the Self-Monitoring Placebo as the placebo control across six weeks. Digital PAI comprises six weekly 30-minute self-guided online sessions coupled with thrice-daily ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) focusing on PA regulation. The Self-Monitoring Placebo offers non-therapeutic mood-tracking instructions three times daily. The same ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) are administered in both groups after each EMI prompt. Clinical outcome assessments are administered at baseline, mid-treatment (Week 3), post-treatment (Week 6), and 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups. Primary outcomes are changes in anxiety and depression severity (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7] and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Secondary outcomes comprise anhedonia, emotion regulation, reward processing, and sleep quality. Randomly selected subsamples will provide wearable data. Analyses will harness multilevel modeling, generalized estimating equations, causal mediation, structural equation modeling, and precision medicine methods to evaluate treatment efficacy, change mechanisms, and moderators. Discussion: This RCT examines the proximal (immediate) and distal (long-term) efficacy of a locally tailored PAI, aligned with cultural values and context, that combine PA improvement strategies with scalable digital delivery to integrate skills into daily routines and settings. It fills essential knowledge gaps in digital mental health research by addressing the positive valence system and incorporating prospective EMA and wearable assessments in real-time. If successful, the Digital PAI may inform stepped-care and stratified care models as well as AI-triaging approaches. These efforts may contribute to more extensive implementation of data-driven, patient-centered care in culturally diverse, resource-limited contexts.

"GymBuddy and Elomia, AI-integrated applications, effects on the mental health of the students with psychological disorders",Jiang J.,2025,BMC Psychology,"Background: Digital mental health interventions, including AI-integrated applications, are increasingly utilized to support individuals with elevated symptoms of psychological distress. However, a gap exists in understanding their efficacy specifically for student populations. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effects of GymBuddy, an AI-powered fitness and accountability app, and Elomia, an AI-based mental health chatbot, on the mental health of students at risk for psychological distress. Methodology: A quasi-experimental study was conducted involving 65 participants who exhibited heightened psychological distress but did not have a formal diagnosis of a psychological disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which utilized GymBuddy and Elomia for structured mental health support, or the control group. Mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and stress levels were assessed using standardized baseline, midpoint, and endpoint measures. Data were analyzed using Mixed ANOVA. Results: The mixed ANOVA analysis revealed significant improvements across all measured mental health outcomes, including somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression. Significant main effects of time and group membership were observed for all variables, indicating overall symptom reduction and baseline differences between groups. Moreover, significant interaction effects for somatic symptoms (F(2, 70) = 59.96, p < 0.0001, η² = 0.63), anxiety and insomnia (F(2, 70) = 32.05, p < 0.0001, η² = 0.48), social dysfunction (F(2, 70) = 59.96, p < 0.0001, η² = 0.63), and severe depression (F(2, 70) = 32.05, p < 0.0001, η² = 0.48) indicated that participants in the intervention group experienced significantly greater reductions in psychological distress compared to the control group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AI-integrated interventions like GymBuddy and Elomia may serve as effective tools for reducing psychological distress in student populations. Integrating AI technology into mental health interventions offers personalized support and guidance, addressing a crucial need in student populations. Further research is warranted to explore long-term outcomes and optimize the implementation of these interventions in educational settings.",10.1186/s40359-025-02640-0,1,Scopus,105003009370,2-s2.0-105003009370,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003009370
"The role of prompt, voice, and personality factors in the acceptance and evaluation of AI-generated mindfulness exercises",Alexander D.,2025,Scientific Reports,"AI-generated mindfulness exercises have the potential to provide tailored mindfulness interventions. However, the role of quality of AI-generated mindfulness exercises on their acceptance and evaluation is as of yet underexplored. The present work investigates effects of prompting (tailored versus non-tailored versus human), voice (trained versus non-trained versus human), and matching voice personality factors on the uncanniness, human likeness, and acceptance of AI-generated mindfulness exercises. In two experiments, n = 143 participants rated real and different variations of AI-generated mindfulness exercises. It was found that trained AI voices significantly improve the evaluation of AI-generated mindfulness exercises comparable to human controls, while no significant effects of prompting were found. A categorization task further showed that exercises by trained AI voices were indistinguishable from human mindfulness exercises. Furthermore, a mismatch of voice personality and setting (mindfulness) significantly decreased voice evaluation. The results demonstrate the importance of using trained and matching AI voices for the implementation of AI-generated mindfulness interventions.",10.1038/s41598-025-21290-1,0,Scopus,105017937101,2-s2.0-105017937101,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017937101

How mental health status and attitudes toward mental health shape AI Acceptance in psychosocial care: a cross-sectional analysis,Fritz B.,2025,BMC Psychology,"Introduction: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become part of our everyday lives and is also increasingly applied in psychosocial healthcare as it can enhance it, make it more accessible, and reduce barriers for help seeking. User behaviour and readiness for AI can be predicted by various factors, such as perceived usefulness (PU) of AI, personality traits and mental health-related variables. Investigating these factors is essential for understanding user acceptance and the future use of AI tools in mental health. This study examines the individual factors that influence the PU of AI in mental health care. In addition, it examines how PU of AI affects the use of mental health apps. For ethical and practical reasons, these apps were considered independently of their AI integration, aiming to support the development of AI-driven mental health applications. Method: In a German-speaking convenience sample N = 302 participants socio-demographic information, personality factors, mental health status, mental health literacy, and various aspects concerning the integration of AI into psychosocial care (PU, AI awareness, digital skills, app use in general) were assessed. Two linear, stepwise regression analyses were conducted, with PU of AI and the participants’ use of mental health apps in general as dependent variables, respectively, and the above-mentioned variables as predictors. Profession, gender, own experience with mental impairments, AI awareness and digital skills were included as covariates. Finally, we performed two moderation analyses to investigate mental health problems and psychological distress as moderators for the relationship between PU and frequency of mental health-related app use—irrespective of AI integration—with working field and digital capabilities as covariates. Results: Higher openness, pessimism and conscientiousness predicted lower PU, whereas higher agreeableness, lower levels of stigma and social distance predicted higher PU. The covariates psychological/ pedagogical training, digital capabilities and experience had a significant influence on PU. Higher frequency of app use in general was predicted by better digital capabilities, higher psychological distress, and more help seeking behaviour. The relationship between PU and the overall use of mental health apps was moderated by psychological distress but not by mental health problems. Discussion: Our study identified individual factors influencing PU for integrating AI into psychosocial care and the frequency of using mental health apps—irrespective of AI integration—and thereby underlines the necessity to tailor AI interventions in psychosocial care to individual needs, personality, and abilities of users to enhance their acceptance and effectiveness.",10.1186/s40359-025-02954-z,1,Scopus,105007470338,2-s2.0-105007470338,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007470338
"A machine learning approach to investigate the role of fear of pain, personal experience, and vicarious learning in dental anxiety",Zsido A.N.,2025,BMC Oral Health,"Background: Dental anxiety is a pervasive problem worldwide, leading to avoidance of dental care, resulting in oral health problems and impacting daily life through social withdrawal and work absenteeism. Addressing this fear is an important public health concern. This study aimed to identify factors that are negatively (e.g., regular dental visits) and positively (e.g., receiving injections, social transmission of fear, anxiety) associated with dental anxiety. Methods: We examined the relationship between dental anxiety and state anxiety, fear of pain associated with injections and other bodily harm, personal experience, and social transmission of fear using a machine learning approach. Participants (N = 802, 625 women, M age = 28.74, SD = 9.15) completed an online survey. Results: Results showed that higher regularity of dental visits was negatively associated (coefficient range: − 0.055 to − 0.097) with dental anxiety. Conversely, we found positive associations between higher levels of anxiety (coefficient range: 0.130 to 0.168), subjectively more painful and distressing last dental visit (coefficient range: 0.322 to 0.343), social transmission of fear (hearing a scary story from friends [coefficient range: 0.024 to 0.128] or the media [coefficient range: 0.024 to 0.027]), and higher fear of pain associated with injections (coefficient range: 0.020 to 0.260) and dental anxiety. Conclusions: These findings highlight the important role of fear of pain associated with injections in dental anxiety, and support that prior benign exposures are protective, while negative experiences increase the risk of developing dental anxiety.

Integrating AI predictive analytics with naturopathic and yoga-based interventions in a data-driven preventive model to improve maternal mental health and pregnancy outcomes,Irfan N.,2025,Scientific Reports,"Maternal mental health during pregnancy is a crucial area of research due to its profound impact on both maternal and child well-being. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to predicting and monitoring psychological health risks in pregnant women using advanced machine learning techniques. The study employs a systematic methodology including data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and model implementation. Data collection was conducted at Majidia Hospital, involving a diverse sample of 70,000 pregnant women recruited through antenatal clinics, online health platforms, community outreach programs, and telephone surveys using structured questionnaires. Participants were selected across all pregnancy trimesters to ensure a representative demographic, capturing variations in age, educational background, occupational status, and parity. A diverse set of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were evaluated alongside ensemble methods to achieve robust and reliable predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that the Random Forest model consistently outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 97.82% ± 0.03%, precision of 97.82% ± 0.03%, recall of 100.00% ± 0.00%, and an F1 score of 96.81% ± 0.02%. SVM and Decision Tree classifiers also showed strong performance, with accuracy scores of 93.79% ± 0.01% and 91.82% ± 0.03%, respectively. Furthermore, ensemble methods enhanced predictive performance, highlighting their ability to balance accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

"Detecting schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis vulnerability and major depressive disorder from 5 minutes of online-collected speech",Olah J.,2025,Translational Psychiatry,"Psychosis poses substantial social and healthcare burdens. The analysis of speech is a promising approach for the diagnosis and monitoring of psychosis, capturing symptoms like thought disorder and flattened affect. Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies enable the automated extraction of informative speech features, which has been leveraged for early psychosis detection and assessment of symptomology. However, critical gaps persist, including the absence of standardized sample collection protocols, small sample sizes, and a lack of multi-illness classification, limiting clinical applicability. Our study aimed to (1) identify an optimal assessment approach for the online and remote collection of speech, in the context of assessing the psychosis spectrum and evaluate whether a fully automated, speech-based machine learning (ML) pipeline can discriminate among different conditions on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum (SSD-BD-SPE), help-seeking comparison subjects (MDD), and healthy controls (HC) at varying layers of analysis and diagnostic complexity. We adopted online data collection methods to collect 20 min of speech and demographic information from individuals. Participants were categorized as “healthy” help-seekers (HC), having a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SSD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), or being on the psychosis spectrum with sub-clinical psychotic experiences (SPE). SPE status was determined based on self-reported clinical diagnosis and responses to the PHQ-8 and PQ-16 screening questionnaires, while other diagnoses were determined based on self-report from participants. Linguistic and paralinguistic features were extracted and ensemble learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost) were used to train models. A 70–30% train-test split and 30-fold cross-validation was used to validate the model performance. The final analysis sample included 1140 individuals and 22,650 min of speech. Using 5 min of speech, our model could discriminate between HC and those with a serious mental illness (SSD or BD) with 86% accuracy (AUC = 0.91, Recall = 0.7, Precision = 0.98). Furthermore, our model could discern among HC, SPE, BD and SSD groups with 86% accuracy (F1 macro = 0.855, Recall Macro = 0.86, Precision Macro = 0.86). Finally, in a 5-class discrimination task including individuals with MDD, our model had 76% accuracy (F1 macro = 0.757, Recall Macro = 0.758, Precision Macro = 0.766). Our ML pipeline demonstrated disorder-specific learning, achieving excellent or good accuracy across several classification tasks. We demonstrated that the screening of mental disorders is possible via a fully automated, remote speech assessment pipeline. We tested our model on relatively high number conditions (5 classes) in the literature and in a stratified sample of psychosis spectrum, including HC, SPE, SSD and BD (4 classes). We tested our model on a large sample (N = 1150) and demonstrated best-in-class accuracy with remotely collected speech data in the psychosis spectrum, however, further clinical validation is needed to test the reliability of model performance.",10.1038/s41398-025-03433-0,0,Scopus,105010612966,2-s2.0-105010612966,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010612966
Prediction of suicide using web based voice recordings analyzed by artificial intelligence,Krautz A.E.,2025,Scientific Reports,"The integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning models in suicide risk assessment has advanced significantly in recent years. In this study, we utilized ML in a case-control design, we predicted completed suicides using publicly available, web-based, real-world voice data, and treating speech as a biomarker. Our model demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing between individuals who died by suicide and carefully matched controls achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74. This improved to an AUC of 0.85 and an accuracy of 76% when analyzing the subset of individuals who died by suicide within 12 months of the audio recording. The best predictive performance was observed with the Multilayer perceptron model, particularly when using the all Bene, Q + U Bene, and Q + U Raw feature sets—highlighting the importance of combining structured and unstructured paralinguistic features. The findings highlight the critical temporal proximity of voice biomarkers to suicide risk. The model’s robustness is further evidenced by its resilience to perturbations in the analytical pipeline. This is the first study to successfully predict actual suicidal behavior rather than surrogate markers, marking a major step forward in suicide prevention. By demonstrating that speech can serve as a non-invasive and objective biomarker for suicide risk, this research opens new avenues for diagnostic and prognostic applications.",10.1038/s41598-025-08639-2,0,Scopus,105010106468,2-s2.0-105010106468,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010106468
"Role of introvert and extrovert personalities in perception of COVID-19’s impact, psychological state, knowledge, infection, and preparedness preferences",Li J.,2025,BMC Public Health,"Background: The role of introversion and extraversion in shaping pandemic responses remains understudied in the field of public health. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate differences in perceptions of COVID-19’s impact, psychological status, knowledge of COVID-19, infection rate, and preferred preparations among introverts and extroverts. Methods: This study utilized a cross-sectional design. From May to June 2022, an online survey was conducted, involving 1,990 adults in Hong Kong. Regression analyses were employed to identify personality differences across 58 outcomes of interest. To account for multiplicity, adjustments were made using the Holm-Bonferroni method. Results: Extroverts reported a greater increase in having a meal at home (adjusted p [adj.p] < 0.001), while introverts’ sleep quality decreased more (adj.p < 0.001). Although no statistical difference was detected between the decrease they showed in emotional stress (adj.p = 1.000) and mental burden (adj.p = 1.000), introverts had higher levels of anxiety (adj.p = 0.006), depression (adj.p < 0.001), and fear (adj.p = 0.026), whereas extroverts had stronger out of control feelings (adj.p = 0.010). Besides, extroverts had higher self-rated knowledge on COVID-19 knowledge (adj.p = 0.016) and prevention (adj.p < 0.001). Moreover, extroverts perceived higher importance in online consultation with doctors, instant personalized health by online chatbot, online courses, instant streaming courses, medicine delivery, online shopping, and food delivery (all adj.p < 0.05). Conclusions: Introverts could benefit most from interventions addressing sleep quality, anxiety, depression, fear, and knowledge promotion about COVID-19, while extroverts could benefit most from approaches that address feeling out of control. Extroverts had higher preferences for online consultations, instant personalized health via online chatbots, streaming courses, online courses, and medicine delivery, emphasizing the importance of considering personality in field of telemedicine, e-health, and remote medicine practice.

Neurometabolic predictors of mental effort in the frontal cortex,Barakat A.,2025,Translational Psychiatry,"Motivation drives individuals to overcome costs to achieve desired outcomes, such as rewards or avoidance of punishment, with significant variability across individuals. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC/dACC) and anterior insula are key brain regions implicated in effort-based decision-making. Here, we utilized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) at 7 Tesla on 69 healthy participants in these brain regions to uncover the neurometabolic factors that influence these differences. We designed and applied an effort-based decision-making task requiring mental and physical effort to probe motivated behavior, complemented by computational modeling to extract key behavioral parameters. Gradient boosting machine learning was applied to explore the predictive role of specific metabolites in motivated behavior. Our results reveal that a model established on dmPFC/dACC metabolites explains decisions to exert high mental effort and sensitivity to mental effort. In particular, glutamate, aspartate, and lactate in dmPFC/dACC, three metabolites linked through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis, were identified as key discriminative metabolites in the dmPFC/dACC, predictive of mental effort choices, underpinning energy supply and cognitive processes. Anterior insula metabolites did not significantly relate to effort-related decisions. Notably, glutamine and lactate levels between the periphery (plasma) and the dmPFC/dACC were correlated, suggesting a metabolic link between peripheral and central biomarkers of effort. Our findings provide novel insights into the neurometabolic underpinnings of motivated behavior and propose novel biomarkers for mental effort-based decision-making.

Methods: We conducted a 2 × 2 online experiment with 513 participants in China. The experiment manipulated the healthcare provider’s algorithmic ethics approach (proactive vs. passive) and the healthcare engagement type (privacy-focused vs. utility-focused). Participants were randomly assigned to view a scenario describing a hospital’s AI diagnostic system, then completed measures of attitudes, trust, and intentions to use the AI-enabled service. Results: Proactive algorithmic ethics practices significantly increased positive attitudes, trust, and usage intentions compared to passive practices. The positive impact of proactive practices was stronger for privacy-focused healthcare (e.g., mental health services) compared to utility-focused services emphasizing care optimization. Conclusions: This study underscores the critical role of proactive, context-specific algorithmic ethics practices in cultivating patient trust and engagement with AI-enabled healthcare. To optimize outcomes, healthcare providers must strategically adapt their ethical governance approaches to align with the unique privacy-utility considerations that are most salient to patients across different healthcare contexts and AI use cases.

Acute suicidal ideation in context: highlighting sentiment-based markers through the diary entries of a clinically depressed sample,Lekkas D.,2025,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Despite major strides in conceptualizing and modeling the multifaceted nature of suicidal thought and behavior (STB) over the past few decades, the overall predictability of STB has not improved. This may be partly due to the dynamic nature of suicidal ideation (SI), which often fluctuates over hours, yet is largely overlooked in studies. Bolstered by the application and promise of natural language processing (NLP) across the mental health field, efforts toward richer operationalization of acute SI may include analyses on written data that occur alongside changes in SI, thus offering a better understanding of STB as it unfolds. Methods: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 268 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) were utilized to investigate acute changes in SI. Data consisted of thrice-daily SI severity scores measured through self-report responses to item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire mobile version (MPHQ-9) as well as free-form diary text. Using difference scores and probability of acute change thresholds, eleven acute SI phase trajectory types were defined to label change in SI over three consecutive EMAs. In total, 5,938 acute SI trajectories were paired with the temporally centered diary entries. The Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine (SEANCE) tool was applied to quantify the written content of each diary entry across eight established lexica. Entry results were grouped based on phase trajectory type, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was employed with post-hoc multiple hypothesis correction to statistically compare SEANCE features between all group pairs. Results: There were 131 statistically significant (adjusted p-value < 0.05) pairwise differences between acute SI phase trajectory groups, implicating 31 NLP features. Consistent with the literature, results highlighted qualities of writing that are generally associated with heightened SI, including personal pronoun usage, passivity, and negative valence. Patterns of significance also uncovered novel contextual nuance in terms of how characteristics such as verbosity, hostility, anger, and pleasantness present in relation to SI over short change trajectories. Conclusions: This work provides an accessible exploratory framework that capitalizes on the benefits of dense EMA sampling and NLP to profile and quantify acute SI trajectories. The use of the MPHQ’s item 9 to quantify SI is an important limitation as it is designed to also capture precursory SI, passive SI, and SI-adjacent behaviors, potentially overestimating the SI expressed by participants. Nonetheless, future research should continue to focus on short timeframes as there are likely important signals and interpretative nuances to SI expression that have yet to be fully detailed.",10.1186/s12888-025-07108-4,1,Scopus,105009535590,2-s2.0-105009535590,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009535590
Artificial intelligence-assisted chatbot: impact on breastfeeding outcomes and maternal anxiety,Kerimoglu Yildiz G.,2025,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in healthcare interventions to provide accessible, continuous, and personalized patient support. This study investigates the impact of a mobile breastfeeding counseling application developed with artificial AI on mothers’ breastfeeding self-efficacy, success, and anxiety levels. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was employed, involving 60 mothers. Participants were divided into two groups: 30 mothers received AI-based counseling, and 30 mothers were provided a booklet. Data collection tools included a personal information form, Breastfeeding Charting System and Assessment Tool (LATCH), Postnatal Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Data were collected from mothers who delivered at a state hospital’s obstetrics and gynecology department and were followed for ten days postpartum (postpartum days 1, 3, 7, and 10). Results: No significant differences were found in the demographic characteristics of the two groups (p > 0.05). Statistically significant improvements were observed in breastfeeding self-efficacy over time for both groups (AI group: f = 36.356, p = 0.000; booklet group: f = 43.349, p = 0.000). At day 10, the AI group scored significantly higher than the booklet group (Z=-2.216, p = 0.027). For breastfeeding success, as measured by the LATCH tool, significant differences were also noted over time for both groups (AI group: f = 68.466, p = 0.000; booklet group: f = 68.088, p = 0.000). At day seven, the AI group outperformed the booklet group (Z=-2.995, p = 0.003). Anxiety levels showed no significant differences between groups. Conclusions: AI-based breastfeeding counseling positively impacts breastfeeding self-efficacy and success. The findings highlight the potential of AI applications in healthcare. AI-based chatbots can serve as effective tools for breastfeeding education, offering accessible, personalized, and continuous support. The significant improvements in breastfeeding outcomes indicate that innovative AI-assisted interventions can effectively support mothers during the critical early postpartum period. This research demonstrates the feasibility of integrating AI technology into maternal care and serves as a foundation for future studies.

Analysis of sub-health status and related factors in medical students in the Chinese Mainland from the perspective of health ecology,Jiang Y.,2025,BMC Public Health,"Background: Sub-health status (SHS) refers to the physical condition in which a person falls between being healthy and having a disease. The sub-health status of medical students is related to many factors. The aim of this study is to explore the current situation and related factors of sub-health of medical students from the perspective of health ecology, to provide a basis for the formulation of intervention measures and improve the health level of medical students. Methods: The data for this study came from a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted in June-August 2022, covering 32 provinces and autonomous regions in mainland China. Multi-stage random sampling was used to recruit. 30,505 valid questionnaires were finally collected. According to the purpose of this study, the subjects were medical students. A total of 1878 subjects were included in the study. Binary stepwise logistic regression and back propagation neural network (BPNN) were used to explore the influencing factors of sub-health. Results: The prevalence of sub-health among medical students in mainland China is 57.5%. Results revealed that negative life events (odds ratio [OR] = 1.64; 95%CI = 1.31–2.04), anxiety (OR = 1.97; 95%CI = 1.27–3.10), depression (OR = 1.80; 95%CI = 1.30–2.51), second-hand smoke exposure (OR = 1.32; 95%CI = 1.06–1.64), problematic Internet use (OR = 1.15; 95%CI = 1.12–1.17), and perceived stress (OR = 1.16; 95%CI = 1.10–1.22) were identified as risk factors for sub-health among medical students, and the level of health literacy was found to be a protective factor for sub-health (OR = 0.96 (95%CI = 0.94–0.98). Sub-health risk increased with increasing smartphone use 1–2 h (OR = 1.34; 95%CI = 1.03–1.73) and ≥ 2 h (OR = 1.44; 95%CI = 1.05–1.98). Four important variables were determined according to the BPNN results: perceived stress, problematic Internet use, depression, and health literacy. Conclusions: Medical students in mainland China have a high rate of SHS, indicating it’s a pressing public health issue for them. Factors like mental health, internet use problems, and health literacy are linked to SHS occurrence in this group. This study provides a scientific basis for early identification of high-risk groups, and provides a reference for developing personalized intervention measures based on the perspective of health ecology.",10.1186/s12889-025-22708-1,3,Scopus,105002974093,2-s2.0-105002974093,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002974093
Prediction of suicidal ideation and depression in the general population with subthreshold insomnia using machine learning models,Prelog P.R.,2025,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Insomnia is a significant independent risk factor for depression and suicidality. However, these conditions often go undetected, particularly in individuals presenting with sleep complaints. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for the indirect screening of suicidal ideation (SI) and depression and to specifically evaluate their performance in a population reporting at least subthreshold insomnia. Methods: Data were obtained from a Slovenian nationwide community sample (N = 2,989) via an online questionnaire. Logistic regression models were developed to predict SI (measured by SIDAS) and moderate-to-severe depression (measured by DASS-21) via indirect predictors, including socio-demographics, life satisfaction, behavioral changes, and 14 coping strategies from the Brief COPE inventory. The model performance was tested on a validation sample, which was stratified into groups with (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] score ≥ 8; n = 917) and without (ISI < 8; n = 819) insomnia symptoms. Results: The models demonstrated strong and consistent predictive performance across both groups. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the SI model was 0.78 in the insomnia group and 0.80 in the non-insomnia group. For the depression model, the AUROCs were 0.79 and 0.82, respectively. The minimal difference in performance indicates that the models are robust and equally effective regardless of the presence of insomnia. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that ML models using indirect questions can effectively screen for both suicidality and depression simultaneously. The models' robust performance in individuals with insomnia highlights their potential as feasible, ethical, and efficient tools for early detection. Given that sleep complaints are a common reason for seeking healthcare, this approach offers a critical opportunity for timely intervention in a high-risk population, potentially reducing preventable morbidity and mortality associated with suicide and depression.",10.1186/s12888-025-07451-6,0,Scopus,105019113793,2-s2.0-105019113793,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019113793
Machine learning-based predictive model for postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder: A prospective cohort study,Chen J.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Postpartum Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a public health issue affecting both mothers and infants. Early identification of high-risk women for PTSD could mitigate its impacts. This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning (ML)-based model for predicting PTSD risk in the early postpartum period. Methods: A prospective cohort study collected sociodemographic and clinical, adverse childhood experiences, and biochemical data at 3 days postpartum, with PTSD symptoms assessed at 42 days postpartum. Five ML models were developed using Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical application in an independent validation cohort, with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (AUC). The best-performing model was deployed as a web application. Results: A total of 900 postpartum women were included in model development and 300 in the validation cohort. AUCs for the five models ranged from 0.768 to 0.850, with the LR model performing best (AUC of 0.850; 95%CI: 0.776–0.923). The LR model achieved a Brier score of 0.069, sensitivity of 0.844, specificity of 0.724, and F1 score of 0.406. A web-based calculator incorporating 8 predictors was developed for clinical use. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a ML-based model in predicting postpartum PTSD risk. The developed web-based risk calculator enables early identification of high-risk women, supporting timely and targeted interventions. These findings highlight the potential of ML tools to improve maternal mental health care, though further calibration in independent and diverse cohorts is needed.",10.1016/j.jad.2025.119935,0,Scopus,105010583310,2-s2.0-105010583310,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010583310
Evaluating a brief smartphone-based stress management intervention with heart rate biofeedback from built-in sensors in a three arm randomized controlled trial,Fuhrmann L.M.,2025,Scientific Reports,"Perceived stress is prevalent in industrial societies, negatively impacting mental health. Smartphone-based stress management interventions provide accessible alternatives to traditional methods, but their efficacy remains modest, potentially due to limited integration of smartphone sensor technology. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an 18-day smartphone-based stress management intervention, MT-StressLess with integrated heart rate (HR)-based biofeedback using built-in accelerometer sensors, compared to a waitlist control (WLC) condition. Secondary outcomes included emotion regulation skills, depressive symptoms, overall well-being, usbiality and usage data. As exploratory aims, we investigated whether the MT-StressLess version without HR-based biofeedback was also superior to the WLC condition, and whether the version with HR-based biofeedback provided additional benefits compared to the version without. In a three-arm randomized controlled trial, 166 participants were assigned to MT-StressLess with HR-based biofeedback, MT-StressLess, or the WLC condition. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze intervention effects over time (baseline, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up). At postintervention, MT-StressLess with HR-based biofeedback showed significantly greater reductions in perceived stress compared to the WLC condition (d = 0.41, 95% CI [0.03, 0.79]), whereas the version without biofeedback did not differ significantly (d = 0.14, 95% CI [−0.24, 0.51]). No significant differences were observed between the two active conditions (d = 0.29, 95% CI [−0.08, 0.66]). Both active conditions, however, led to significant improvements in the secondary outcomes of emotion regulation skills and well-being compared to the WLC (all ds = −0.58 to −0.27). These patterns persisted at the 1-month follow-up. Usability ratings were high, but overall adherence was moderate. The findings in the main comparison may reflect increased interoceptive awareness and self-regulation. Yet, the limited effects of the core intervention and the biofeedback component also suggest the influence of non-specific factors, such as placebo effects, outcome expectancy and user engagement, which highlights the need to better understand optimal intervention duration, motivation, reinforcement, and more individualized approaches to stress reactivity. Overall, the findings provide preliminary support for the potential of a smartphone-based intervention that includes HR-based biofeedback to reduce perceived stress compared to no intervention. As these interventions are still in their early stages, future research should explore how personalization driven by artificial intelligence and real-time physiological tracking can enhance engagement and efficacy.",10.1038/s41598-025-06588-4,1,Scopus,105008755259,2-s2.0-105008755259,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008755259
Facial emotion based smartphone addiction detection and prevention using deep learning and video based learning,Joseph C.,2025,Scientific Reports,"Smartphone addiction among students has emerged as a critical issue, negatively impacting their academic performance, emotional well-being, and social behavior. This paper introduces the Theory of Mind integrated with Video Modelling (TMVM) framework, a novel deep learning-based approach aimed at recognizing and mitigating smartphone addiction. The TMVM framework leverages Theory of Mind AI to analyze students’ facial emotions via smartphone cameras while watching videos. Based on detected emotions such as happiness, sadness, or anger, the system dynamically shuffles motivational videos using advanced algorithms like Fisher-Yates and Durstenfeld shuffling techniques to promote behavioral change. The framework also incorporates Behavior Parameters (BHP) evaluation, grounded in the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE) theory, to assess key behavioral metrics such as social identity, self-awareness, anonymity, responsibility, and accountability. Additionally, face emotion detection algorithms tuned with MnasNet-Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)-Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO) are employed for accurate emotion recognition. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in students’ behavior and reductions in smartphone usage post-intervention. The TMVM system achieves high accuracy in emotion detection and behavioral outcome prediction while fostering engagement in school and social activities. TMVM method is tested in 750 students with low BHP and evaluated the behavioural parameters. After the intervention of TMVM the students showed more than 90% improvement in their BHP parameters. A paired sample t-test revealed notable reductions in mean scores from pre- to post-intervention across all measured dimensions. Social identity decreased from 4.07 to 2.21 (t(55) = 16.125, p < 0.001), anonymity from 4.11 to 2.01 (t(55) = 15.699, p < 0.001), self-awareness from 3.95 to 1.93 (t(55) = 15.103, p < 0.001), loss of individuality from 4.04 to 2.07 (t(55) = 13.364, p < 0.001), while sense of responsibility and accountability improved with mean differences of 1.18 and 2.0, respectively, both statistically significant at p < 0.001.The results showed 85% improvement in students’ knowledge and attitudes.",10.1038/s41598-025-99681-7,1,Scopus,105005775694,2-s2.0-105005775694,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005775694
Comparative effectiveness and user-rated helpfulness of digital just-in-time adaptive interventions for psychological distress,Yarrington J.S.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Digital just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), or interventions that can be offered in a context when support is needed most, represent a promising development for improving scalable, personalized interventions. However, the comparative efficacy of specific JITAIs has yet to be examined. The present study examines engagement with and usefulness of JITAIs provided through a mental health application, Youper. This study uses data from Youper users (N = 8323) collected between July and October of 2020. Users were randomized to one of nine cognitive or behavioral interventions, although the present study examined interactions with only six cognitive interventions (e.g., gratitude, mindfulness, cognitive restructuring). If users engaged with the intervention, they subsequently rated its helpfulness. Engagement was examined with logistic regression and user-rated helpfulness of JITAIs was explored through a multi-level model. A secondary analysis examined whether pre-intervention emotions moderated the results. Compared to acceptance-based interventions, users had significantly greater odds of engaging with cognitive restructuring, problem-solving, self-compassion, and gratitude interventions (all ps < 0.001), but significantly lower odds of engaging with mindfulness-based interventions (p < .001). Cognitive restructuring, gratitude, mindfulness, and problem-solving were rated as more helpful than acceptance (all ps < 0.001). There was a non-significant difference between perceived helpfulness of self-compassion and acceptance (p > .05). Pre-intervention emotions did not moderate effects (p > .05). These results suggest that JITAIs, which can be implemented at the moment when users most need support, are helpful emotion regulation tools.",10.1016/j.jad.2025.119878,0,Scopus,105010587963,2-s2.0-105010587963,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010587963
"Clinical, genetic, and sociodemographic predictors of symptom severity after internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety",Kravchenko O.,2025,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) is an effective and accessible treatment for mild to moderate depression and anxiety disorders. However, up to 50% of patients do not achieve sufficient symptom relief. Identifying patient characteristics predictive of higher post-treatment symptom severity is crucial for devising personalized interventions to avoid treatment failures and reduce healthcare costs. Methods: Using the Swedish multimodal database MULTI-PSYCH, we evaluated novel and established predictors associated with treatment outcome and assessed the added benefit of polygenic risk scores (PRS) and nationwide register data in a sample of 2668 patients treated with ICBT for major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Two linear regression models were compared: a baseline model employing six well-established predictors and a full model incorporating six clinic-based, 32 register-based predictors, and PRS for seven psychiatric disorders and traits. Predictor importance was assessed through bivariate associations, and models were compared by the variance explained in post-treatment symptom scores. Results: Our analysis identified several novel predictors of higher post-treatment severity, including comorbid ASD and ADHD, receipt of financial benefits, and prior use of psychotropic medications. The baseline model explained 27%, while the full model accounted for 34% of the variance. Conclusions: The findings suggest that a model incorporating a broad array of multimodal data offered a modest improvement in explanatory power compared to one using a limited set of easily accessible measures. Employing machine learning algorithms capable of capturing complex non-linear associations and interactions is a viable next step to improve prediction of post-ICBT symptom severity.

EEG Emotion Copilot: Optimizing lightweight LLMs for emotional EEG interpretation with assisted medical record generation,Chen H.,2025,Neural Networks,"In the fields of affective computing (AC) and brain-computer interface (BCI), the analysis of physiological and behavioral signals to discern individual emotional states has emerged as a critical research frontier. While deep learning-based approaches have made notable strides in EEG emotion recognition, particularly in feature extraction and pattern recognition, significant challenges persist in achieving end-to-end emotion computation, including rapid processing, individual adaptation, and seamless user interaction. This paper presents the EEG Emotion Copilot, a system optimizing a lightweight large language model (LLM) with 0.5B parameters operating in a local setting, which first recognizes emotional states directly from EEG signals, subsequently generates personalized diagnostic and treatment suggestions, and finally supports the automation of assisted electronic medical records. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical techniques in the novel data structure of prompt, model pruning and fine-tuning training, and deployment strategies aiming at improving performance and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our optimized lightweight LLM-based copilot achieves an enhanced intuitive interface for participant interaction, superior accuracy of emotion recognition and assisted electronic medical records generation, in comparison to such models with similar scale parameters or large-scale parameters such as 1.5B, 1.8B, 3B and 7B. In summary, through these efforts, the proposed copilot is expected to advance the application of AC in the medical domain, offering innovative solution to mental health monitoring.

Interpretable machine learning approaches for children’s ADHD detection using clinical assessment data: an online web application deployment,Qin H.,2025,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent mental disorder characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. This study aims to develop a verifiable and interpretable machine learning model to identify ADHD and its subtypes in children using clinical assessment scales data. Methods: This study utilized the ADHD-200 dataset, including demographic data, Behavioral Rating Scale, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale assessments, to train and validate our models. The model’s performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation within the internal dataset, and the best model will be used for external validation. Seven machine learning models were evaluated. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed for model interpretation. Finally, a web application will deploy the prediction model to provide ADHD probabilities based on user input. Results: The Random Forest (RF) model performing best in identifying ADHD and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model excelling in distinguishing ADHD subtypes. The RF model achieved an AUC of 0.99 in 10-fold cross-validation and an AUC of 0.99 in external validation, and the SVM model achieved a micro-average AUC of 0.96 and an accuracy of 0.83 in internal validation and a micro-average AUC of 0.96 and an accuracy of 0.85 in external validation. We used SHAP to interpret the models, revealing that higher ADHD Index pushed the model towards ADHD classification. Additionally, lower IQ scores were correlated with a higher likelihood of ADHD, consistent with previous studies. The dependency analysis found that the model can identify different behavioral scales. We deployed the final model online using a web application and showed users how the model made decisions. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential of using machine learning and clinical assessment scales to support the diagnosis and subtype identification of ADHD in children, offering a practical solution for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings.",10.1186/s12888-025-06573-1,2,Scopus,85218502245,2-s2.0-85218502245,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218502245
"Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Youth Mental Health Care: Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions",Marshall N.J.,2025,Current Treatment Options in Psychiatry,"Purpose: Youth mental health challenges are on the rise. Despite significant efforts to expand access, traditional approaches are unable to keep pace with the growing demand. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution to bridge the needs-provision gap, most clinicians remain unaware of the expanding range of AI tools. To support a clearer understanding of the field, this practitioner-focused commentary uses illustrative examples to explore current and future applications of AI in youth mental healthcare; address key challenges in adoption; and provide a practical framework for safe and effective integration into clinical practice. Recent Findings: AI is becoming increasingly embedded in youth mental health care, with applications spanning early detection, diagnostic decision-making, treatment delivery, clinician training, and research acceleration. While these technologies hold significant promise, many remain insufficiently validated. For youth populations, regulatory gaps, algorithmic biases, digital inequities, and the potential for technological overdependence present distinct barriers to widespread adoption. Summary: AI is the future of youth mental health care. However, given the nascency of the field and the rapid proliferation of new tools, these technologies should be approached with thoughtful caution. To ensure safe and effective integration, clinicians are advised to use AI tools only within their area of expertise, apply them strictly within their defined therapeutic scope, and ensure alignment with legal and professional standards. Crucially, AI should serve as a complement – not a replacement – for traditional care, and may be unsuitable for youth with severe, complex, or rare clinical profiles.",10.1007/s40501-025-00348-x,0,Scopus,105002712030,2-s2.0-105002712030,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002712030
Co-designing an online educational resource to help adolescents improve their digital health literacy,Aloi M.A.,2025,BMC Public Health,"Background: Digital media is ubiquitous in adolescents’ lives and provides many opportunities to engage with health information. However, there is an increased risk of engaging with inaccurate or biased health information on the internet, resulting in poor health-related behaviours. As such, adolescents would benefit from improving their digital health literacy (DHL). There are limited education tools in DHL that are interactive and relatable for adolescents. A co-design approach can incorporate adolescents’ perspectives in designing an education tool to ensure its relevance. Aims: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the co-design approach in creating an educational resource designed to improve adolescents’ DHL. Methods: Three workshops were conducted with adolescents (12–17 years) to explore their DHL habits and education needs, evaluate an existing DHL educational app, co-design new storylines to better meet their needs and beta test the expanded resource. Data was collected through creation of storyboards, annotated posters and worksheets. Data analysis of these artefacts was undertaken through content analysis to identify themes and sub-themes. Results: Forty-four participants attended two co-design workshops. Participants preferred using video-based social media and considered using artificial intelligence (AI) tools for extracting online health information. They designed storylines involving health topics such as dietary supplements, fitness and mental health. Storylines focused on identifying trustworthy online health information sources and dealing with concerns regarding scams, social media influencers and misinformation conveyed by parents. Eight participants who attended the beta-testing workshop positively evaluated the app as engaging and relatable. Discussion: This study clarified the DHL educational needs of adolescents. In particular, it demonstrated the need to include other media literacies, the use of AI tools and interactions with family in the resource to maximise relevance to adolescents. Conclusion: The co-design methodology was useful for understanding adolescents’ DHL lived experiences and developing an engaging educational resource to help them navigate and appraise online health information.",10.1186/s12889-025-22949-0,1,Scopus,105005577323,2-s2.0-105005577323,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005577323

Qualitative framework analysis was conducted on the interview data using a predefined sampling framework. Results: Four themes were identified. Two themes were established a priori: (1) user interaction with the app; and (2) perceived mechanism of change. Two themes were data-driven: (3) benefits of using the app; and (4) perceived barriers to app use. Conclusions: Participants viewed the Actissist app as acceptable and beneficial. Participants perceived two elements, a sense of support and normalisation and increased awareness of mental health, as the key that enabled Actissist to positively impact their mental health. Future developments of DHIs should increase the level of human support and explore the potential of adaptive sampling methods and generative AI technology to improve personalisation in frequency of prompts and content of the intervention.

Machine Learning-Based predictive model for adolescent metabolic syndrome: Utilizing data from NHANES 2007–2016,Zhang Y.Z.,2025,Scientific Reports,"Metabolic syndrome (Mets) in adolescents is a growing public health issue linked to obesity, hypertension, and insulin resistance, increasing risks of cardiovascular disease and mental health problems. Early detection and intervention are crucial but often hindered by complex diagnostic requirements. This study aims to develop a predictive model using NHANES data, excluding biochemical indicators, to provide a simple, cost-effective tool for large-scale, non-medical screening and early prevention of adolescent MetS. After excluding adolescents with missing diagnostic variables, the dataset included 2,459 adolescents via NHANES data from 2007–2016. We used LASSO regression and 20-fold cross-validation to screen for the variables with the greatest predictive value. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio, and SMOTE was used to expand the training set with a ratio of 1:1. Based on the training set, we built eight machine learning models and a multifactor logistic regression model, evaluating nine predictive models in total. After evaluating all models using the confusion matrix, calibration curves and decision curves, the LGB model had the best predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.969, a Youden index of 0.923, accuracy of 0.978, F1 score of 0.989, and Kappa value of 0.800. We further interpreted the LGB model using SHAP, the SHAP hive plot showed that the predictor variables were, in descending order of importance, BMI age sex-specific percentage, weight, upper arm circumference, thigh length, and race. Finally, we deployed it online for broader accessibility. The predictive models we developed and validated demonstrated high performance, making them suitable for large-scale, non-medical primary screening and early warning of adolescent Metabolic syndrome. The online deployment of the model allows for practical use in community and school settings, promoting early intervention and public health improvement.",10.1038/s41598-025-88156-4,1,Scopus,85216996792,2-s2.0-85216996792,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216996792
Entropy-based risk network identification in adolescent self-injurious behavior using machine learning and network analysis,Zhang Z.,2025,Translational Psychiatry,"Adolescent Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB) is a significant global public health issue, with a lifetime prevalence rate of approximately 13.7%. As awareness of SIB rises, there is an urgent need for effective prediction mechanisms to enable early identification and intervention, reducing the risk of suicide and self-harm attempts. This study, grounded in Psychopathological Network Theory, uses machine learning and network analysis to explore the multidimensional structure of risk factors for adolescent SIB. A survey of 2047 adolescents aged 11 to 17 years in China analyzed 19 variables across physiological, psychological, and social domains. The Entropy Weight Method (EWM) was applied to combine network analysis and machine learning outcomes for a comprehensive risk evaluation. The study identified key risk factors for SIB, including loneliness, ADHD symptoms, Internet addiction, anxiety, depression, affinity for solitude, autistic traits, being bullied. These factors interact within a complex network structure, influencing the occurrence of SIB both directly and indirectly. The integration of EWM, network analysis, and machine learning provides a more precise risk assessment approach for adolescent SIB. The findings offer valuable insights into the causal mechanisms of SIB and emphasize the importance of targeted prevention and intervention strategies.",10.1038/s41398-025-03511-3,1,Scopus,105013644763,2-s2.0-105013644763,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013644763
Depression in left-behind adolescents from single-parent families: a nomogram based on multidimensional risk factors,Cen W.C.,2025,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,"Background: Depression is a significant issue affecting adolescents’ mental health. While depression research is relatively extensive, studies focusing on left-behind adolescents from single-parent families remain limited. Due to their unique family structure, this group is more susceptible to multiple stressors, increasing their risk of depression. Objective: This study aims to construct a predictive model based on a nomogram to identify the multidimensional characteristics of depression risk among left-behind adolescents from single-parent families, providing theoretical and practical evidence for early screening and targeted mental health interventions. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the China Psychological Health Guardian Project (CPHG) were utilized to select samples of left-behind adolescents aged 12–20 years from single-parent families (N = 3731). Key variables were identified using Lasso regression, followed by the optimization of the model through binary logistic regression. A nomogram prediction model was then constructed based on significant variables. Results: The study identified gender, age, duration of parental separation, family satisfaction, parental education levels, substance dependence, weekday sleep duration, weekend mobile phone use duration, and chronic diseases as key predictors of depression risk. The nomogram model demonstrated good discriminatory and predictive accuracy, with AUC values of 0.771 and 0.759 in the training and validation sets, respectively. Conclusion: By integrating multidimensional variables, this study developed a predictive model for depression risk among left-behind adolescents from single-parent families, providing scientific evidence for the early identification and intervention of high-risk individuals.",10.1186/s13034-025-00894-5,0,Scopus,105001718277,2-s2.0-105001718277,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001718277
"Study protocol for the Rainbow Austrian Longitudinal Family (RALF) study: a longitudinal, multi-method, multi-rater investigation of risk and resilience factors in Austrian LGBTQ+ parent families",Geidel B.,2025,BMC Psychology,"Background: Research on LGBTQ+ parent families is evolving to include a growing range of family systems, identities, methodologies, and topics. However, studies that examine minority-specific risk and resilience factors and their associations with within-family processes remain scarce, particularly outside a US-American context. Addressing these research gaps quantitatively poses challenges for researchers, because traditional modelling techniques based on (generalized) linear models are not ideally suited to capture the complexity and intersectionality of family experiences. Within this study protocol, we introduce the Rainbow Austrian Longitudinal Family (RALF) study. Its main goal is to comprehensively investigate general and minority-specific factors that affect the well-being of LGBTQ+ parent family members in Austria. Methods: RALF is a three-wave, longitudinal study over two years that examines risk and resilience factors at the individual, couple, and family level using a multi-method, multi-rater approach. We will assess child adjustment outcomes across three child cohorts, parental mental health, and family processes across three annual data waves through online questionnaires. We aim to recruit N = 150 LGBTQ+ parent families from a variety of family forms and with various identities residing in Austria. A focal sample (target n = 60) will additionally participate in observational, video-based assessments. Our participatory research approach aims to actively engage community members and stakeholders throughout the study. A community advisory board ensures that the study reflects the lived experiences of LGBTQ+ parent families adequately, while community events and accessible dissemination strategies for study results, such as the open access data explorer ExploRALF, support community engagement and facilitate the dissemination and discussion of results. Data will be analyzed using machine learning-based approaches designed to capture complex, non-linear interactions, which are ideally suited to model intersectional experiences of LGBTQ+ parent families. Discussion: The RALF study is the first prospective study to comprehensively investigate minority-specific risk and resilience factors in Austrian LGBTQ+ parent families. Findings have the potential to fill key research gaps, inform policy, and guide clinical practices that support LGBTQ+ parent families.",10.1186/s40359-025-02828-4,0,Scopus,105006803012,2-s2.0-105006803012,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006803012
A review of the scope of non-suicidal self-injury behavior in adolescents with depressive disorders: an analysis of related influencing factors,Ling Y.,2025,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behavior is one of the major causes of death and disability in adolescents with depressive disorders, and this behavior has a high detection rate among adolescents globally, which seriously affects their physical and mental health and quality of life. Given the high prevalence and severity of NSSI behavior, this study provides a reference for the future construction of a risk-grading-based preventive intervention framework for NSSI in adolescents with depressive disorders by systematically sorting out the factors affecting non-suicidal self-injury. Methods: This study adopted Arksey and O'Malley's methodology and the scoping review framework. The search took place from the creation of the database until November 12, 2024, in professional guideline websites like NICE and GIN and databases like China Knowledge, Wanfang, CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science. The topics searched for were adolescent depressive disorder, NSSI and behavioral influencing factors in relevant Chinese and English literature. We identified the research questions, completed the literature screening and quality assessment, extracted the data, summarized it, and analyzed it. Results: The study included a total of 15 papers, comprising 1 guideline, 3 systematic evaluations, 1 Literature review, and 10 cross-sectional studies. Study topics focused on four categories: individual characteristics and psychological factors (e.g., gender, age, sexual orientation), illness and treatment factors (duration of illness, degree of depression), behaviors and lifestyles (Internet addiction, stressful events), and family and social environment (family functioning, social support). Conclusion: Factors affecting NSSI behaviors in adolescent patients with depression are intricate and complex, covering multiple dimensions such as personal traits, family environment. The findings of this review emphasize that when conducting NSSI risk assessment for depressed adolescents in clinical practice, in addition to the depressive symptoms themselves, it is also necessary to systematically evaluate those individual psychological traits, behavioral patterns, and environmental factors. We should integrate relevant risk factors to create personalized prevention plans. We aim to decrease the frequency of NSSI behaviors in teenage patients suffering from depressive disorders and halt the progression of additional suicidal actions. Future research can focus on verifying the role of these risk factors in the predictive model and the effectiveness of intervention measures.",10.1186/s12888-025-07361-7,0,Scopus,105017756315,2-s2.0-105017756315,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017756315
Identification of depressive symptoms in adolescents using machine learning combining childhood and adolescence features,Liu X.,2025,BMC Public Health,"Background: Depressive symptoms in adolescents can significantly affect their daily lives and pose risks to their future development. These symptoms may be linked to various factors experienced during both childhood and adolescence. Machine learning (ML) has attracted substantial attention in the field of adolescent depression; however, studies establishing prediction models have primarily considered childhood or adolescent features separately, resulting in a lack of analyses that incorporate factors from both stages. Methods: We collected 39 features related to childhood and adolescence. Using the maximum relevance-minimum redundancy method and four ML algorithms, we determined the optimal feature subset for identifying depressive symptoms and constructed child-adolescent models. Stepwise logistic regression and four ML methods were employed to create demographic and combined models, respectively. The performance of each model was evaluated using a test set, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were utilized to interpret the models’ prediction results. Results: The proposed child-adolescent models exhibited superior performance on the test set than the demographic and combined models (AUC: 0.835–0.879 versus 0.530 and 0.840–0.876, respectively). The optimal feature subset included two childhood features (relationship quality with peers and parental absence) and four adolescence features (social trust, academic pressure, importance of the internet for entertainment, and positive parenting behaviour). These features were found to be more effective than demographic characteristics in distinguishing depressive symptoms in adolescents. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the correlation between adolescence depressive symptoms and specific factors from both childhood and adolescence, as well as the potential of ML to predict it. These findings may serve as a reference for future intervention studies.",10.1186/s12889-025-21506-z,0,Scopus,85216608215,2-s2.0-85216608215,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216608215
Impaired neural activity and functional connectivity in the hippocampus of adolescents with non-suicidal self-injury addiction,Lin X.,2025,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) addiction is prevalent among adolescents, but its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the neural activity and functional connectivity characteristics associated with NSSI addiction using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Methods: A prospective collection of 62 adolescents was completed for this study, including 33 adolescents with self-injury behaviors and 29 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls. The addiction component of the Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory (OSI) was used to assess the degree of NSSI addiction. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analysis was employed to detect changes in local neural activity. Differential brain regions were considered regions of interests (ROIs). Whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis based on ALFF was used to further explore potential changes in functional connections between ROIs and other brain areas in the NSSI group, and to analyze the relationship between these neural changes and addiction characteristics. Results: ALFF analysis revealed decreased ALFF values in the bilateral hippocampus and increased ALFF values in the right supplementary motor area of NSSI adolescents compared to healthy controls. Significantly reduced FC values was observed between the left hippocampus and the left precuneus, right middle temporal gyrus, and right inferior temporal gyrus, and between the right hippocampus and the right middle temporal gyrus. Additionally, increased FC values was observed between the left hippocampus and the left thalamus. Furthermore, ALFF values in the bilateral hippocampus were negatively correlated with the total score of addiction characteristics in NSSI adolescents. Conclusions: This study highlights reduced local neural activity and functional connectivity in the bilateral hippocampus of NSSI adolescents, and demonstrates that these alterations are associated with heightened addictive features in self-injuring individuals.

Depression intervention using AI chatbots with social cues: a randomized trial of effectiveness,Xu S.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Depression is a serious problem among college students, and chatbots are a popular intervention tool. Social cues are used in chatbot design, but their effectiveness in depression treatment remains to be verified. This study aimed to compare the effects of chatbots with high-social-cue (HSC) versus low-social-cue (LSC) designs on depressive symptoms. Methods: An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted over 16 weeks. Eighty-four college students with baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores ≥9 were randomly assigned to either an HSC group (text + voice + animations) or LSC group (text-only). Clinical outcomes, including PHQ-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scores, were collected every 4 weeks. Secondary measures included user satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8, CSQ-8), therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised, WAI-SR), and self-reported adherence. Results: Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that the HSC group achieved greater reductions in PHQ-9 (d = 0.63, P < 0.01) and GAD-7 (d = 0.50, P = 0.003) scores compared to the LSC group. The HSC group also demonstrated higher adherence rates (d = 0.82, P < 0.01), CSQ-8 (P = 0.02), and WAI-SR scores (P < 0.001). LSC group.

Profiles of AI anxiety among Chinese public administration students and the predictive role of resilience: A self-determination theory perspective,Liu P.,2025,Learning and Motivation,"As generative artificial intelligence tools increasingly permeate higher education, students face new psychological challenges alongside technological opportunities. Guided by Self-Determination Theory, this study examined patterns and predictors of AI anxiety among 1247 Chinese university students majoring in public administration. Using Latent Profile Analysis, four distinct anxiety profiles were identified: Minimally Affected, Societal Risk-Oriented, Sociotechnical Sensitive, and Hypervigilant. Chi-square tests revealed significant group differences by gender, age, and AI usage frequency. Multinomial logistic regression showed that higher psychological resilience significantly reduced the likelihood of belonging to any elevated anxiety group.

Comparative Risk for Neuropsychiatric Events in Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist vs. Inhaled Corticosteroid in Children With Asthma: A Nationwide Observational Study With a Complementary Analysis Using Natural Language Processing,Kim S.,2025,Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety,"PURPOSE: Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are widely prescribed as controller medications for pediatric asthma. However, there have been increasing concerns about potential neuropsychiatric adverse reactions associated with LTRAs. Findings from observational studies have been inconsistent, and direct comparisons of the risk of neuropsychiatric events (NPEs) between LTRAs and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) remain limited in the pediatric population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted utilizing a nationwide claims database (January 2018-April 2022) and a multicenter electronic health record (EHR) database (January 2006-March 2022) from South Korea. Patients aged 5-18 years diagnosed with asthma before initiating LTRA or ICS were included. The primary outcome was NPEs within 90 days of exposure, defined using two methods: diagnostic code-based analysis and natural language processing (NLP)-based analysis using clinical notes. After propensity score stratification, Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate risks. RESULTS: The diagnostic code-based analysis on the claims database included 169 636 LTRA users and 28 845 ICS users. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of NPEs between LTRA and ICS (calibrated hazard ratios [HRs], 1.14 [95% CI, 0.92-1.42]). In the NLP-based analysis using EHR database, 1641 LTRA users and 1607 ICS users were included. The results were consistent with those of the diagnostic code-based analysis (calibrated HR, 1.33 [95% CI, 0.66-2.68]). CONCLUSIONS: LTRA use was not found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of NPEs in children with asthma. These findings offer valuable insights to support clinical decision-making in pediatric asthma treatment.",10.1002/pds.70254,0,Scopus,105020480141,2-s2.0-105020480141,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020480141
The usability and feasibility of a self-compassion chatbot (COMPASS) for youth living with type 1 diabetes,Boggiss A.L.,2025,Diabetic Medicine,"Aim: Although it is well established that youth with type 1 Diabetes (T1D) experience high rates of distress, current clinical care is often under-resourced and unable to provide sufficient or timely psychological support. The current study was designed to evaluate the safety, usability and feasibility of ‘COMPASS,’ a self-compassion chatbot intervention. Methods: Forty adolescents (aged 12–16 years) living with T1D participated in a 12-week, single-group feasibility study using a mixed methods approach. Usability was assessed via qualitative feedback and interviews, feasibility through app analytics and recruitment data, and safety by utilisation of distress risk management protocols. Psychosocial measures (including diabetes distress, strengths and resilience, self-efficacy, self-compassion, self-care behaviours and emotional well-being) were collected at baseline, 6- and 12-week follow-ups, alongside HbA1c at baseline and 12 weeks. Results: Of 40 participants recruited, 32 (80%) completed the study. On average, participants completed 95% of modules started. Follow-up assessments showed promising reductions in diabetes distress, and improvements in resilience, self-efficacy, self-compassion and emotional well-being. Qualitative analysis highlighted strengths in engagement and relevance of information covered. Areas for improvement included increasing decision-making support to help alleviate the felt burden of diabetes. Conclusions: The COMPASS chatbot was demonstrated to be safe, feasible and acceptable to adolescents living with T1D.

Comparison of Expert Vocabulary Usage Patterns Between Mental Health and Nonmental Health Clinicians When Diagnosing Pediatric Anxiety Disorders,Chandrashekar M.,2025,Journal of Pediatrics,"Objective: To compare the utilization patterns of expert vocabulary (EVo) in diagnosing pediatric anxiety between mental health and non-mental health clinical notes from electronic health records to understand the role of Evo in informing classification and decision-making in anxiety diagnoses. Study design: We conducted a retrospective study using a cohort less than age 25 from Cincinnati Children's Hospital including 897 685 patients with 61 586 446 notes. We analyzed EVo, collected from mental health clinicians, in both mental and nonmental health notes. We compared classification accuracy using EVo-based patient-level embedding from all clinical notes, mental-health notes, and nonmental health notes for 2 tasks: 1) pre-vs postdiagnosis anxiety patients, and 2) prediagnosis anxiety vs nonanxiety patients. Results: EVo usage was highest in prediagnosis anxiety, lower in nonanxiety, and lowest in post-diagnosis. Classification models using EVo features from all, mental-health, and non-mental health notes showed similar F1 scores for prediagnosis anxiety (0.70 ± 0.2 for 2 categories). For anxiety vs nonanxiety classification, all clinical and nonmental health notes had better F1 scores than mental-health notes (above 0.90 for 3 categories). There was a notable difference in class-wise performance across both tasks. Conclusions: There are significant differences in anxiety EVo use between mental health and nonmental health clinicians. Despite less anxiety-specific terminology, non-mental health notes still captured key aspects of patient presentations, emphasizing the importance of including all clinicians' notes in analysis. EVo's utility for anxiety classification is most effective in prediagnostic phases, suggesting the need for a dedicated diagnostic lexicon and further study before incorporating EVo into classification models.",10.1016/j.jpeds.2025.114735,0,Scopus,105012741602,2-s2.0-105012741602,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012741602

For the midwestern university, there will be 11 surveys (baseline, nine follow-ups, and an endline) collected throughout a single academic year (2024–2025). However, at the southwestern university, only nine surveys will be administered during a semester. Simultaneously, sensor-based behavioral data on behaviors such as physical activity, social interactions, and sleep will be continuously collected passively. The main analysis will focus on understanding the relationships between human behaviors captured by sensor-based behavioral data and self-reported mental health surveys. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms will be used to uncover key behavioral patterns most indicative of mental disorders such as depression.",10.1371/journal.pone.0335847,0,Scopus,105020447831,2-s2.0-105020447831,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020447831
"Generative AI Use among College Students in South Korea: Usage, Perception, and Institutional Support",Oh C.Y.,2025,Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology,"This poster reports preliminary findings from an online survey of 191 college students in South Korea examining their learning and use of Generative AI (Gen AI) tools, perceived benefits, and institutional support. Participants mainly used Gen AI for academic tasks, such as doing assignments, and also reported using Gen AI in everyday life, notably for topics such as travel planning, entertainment recommendation, and mental health. However, while 89.5% of participants had experience in using Gen AI, only 33.5% received support for Gen AI use from universities or university libraries. A majority used self-learning to learn how to use Gen AI, and more commonly used learning methods were not necessarily more helpful learning methods for Gen AI. Our findings suggest opportunities to help students learn how to use Gen AI effectively and responsibly. This research contributes to an empirical study of college students’ Gen AI use for academic and everyday life contexts, calling for more institutional support and human-centered research for equitable access to and effective use of Gen AI for college students.",10.1002/pra2.1483,0,Scopus,105019798974,2-s2.0-105019798974,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019798974
Measuring the Impact of Large Language Models on Academic Success and Quality of Life Among Students with Visual Disability: An Assistive Technology Perspective,Elshaer I.A.,2025,Bioengineering,"In the rapid digital era, artificial intelligence (AI) tools have progressively arisen to shape the education environment. In this context, large language models (LLMs) (i.e., ChatGPT vs. 4.0 and Gemini vs. 2.5) have emerged as powerful applications for academic inclusion. This paper investigated how using and trusting LLMs can impact the academic success and quality of life (QoL) of visually impaired university students. Quantitative research was conducted, obtaining data from 385 visually impaired university students through a structured survey design. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was implemented to test the study hypotheses. The findings revealed that trust in LLMs can significantly predict LLM usage, which in turn can improve QoL. While LLM usage failed to directly support the academic success of disabled students, but its impact was mediated through QoL, suggesting that enhancements in well-being can contribute to higher academic success. The results highlighted the importance of promoting trust in AI applications, along with developing an accessible, inclusive, and student-centred digital environment. The study offers practical contributions for educators and policymakers, shedding light on the importance of LLM applications for both the QoL and academic success of visually impaired university students.",10.3390/bioengineering12101056,0,Scopus,105020029756,2-s2.0-105020029756,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020029756
Exploring Emerging Adults’ Health Information Practices with AI through a Cognitive Authority Lens,Joshi S.,2025,Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology,"The PEW Research reports that after the COVID pandemic around 37% of teens have mental health issues (Schaeffer, 2025) and almost 50% of teens attribute this to social media (Park, 2025). Initial explorations among emerging adults (Hochberg & Konner, 2020) have shown that even though social media apps are still the primary choice of information source, the use of generative AI is on the rise (Rainie, 2023). However, it is not yet clear how emerging adults between the ages of 18 and 24 evaluate information and determine credibility and trustworthiness of health information sources that are based on artificial intelligence (AI). This project is a work in progress and intends to explore the information behavior and practices of emerging adults in New Jersey who use generative AI for health information. Using data obtained from observation-based interviews (Lindhof & Taylor, 2019; Lareau, 2021) of selected participants, I shall use selective coding (Charmaz, 2014) to examine how concepts of cognitive authority can help to inform information behavior and practices of emerging adults. This research is conducted through a cognitive authority lens (Wilson, 1983; Rieh & Belkin, 1998) with the hope that an understanding of the relationships between emerging adults and health information sources may provide insights into better strategies to provide access to trustworthy and credible health information.",10.1002/pra2.1449,0,Scopus,105019772920,2-s2.0-105019772920,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019772920
Effect of an AI agent trained on a large language model (LLM) as an intervention for depression and anxiety symptoms in young adults: A 28-day randomized controlled trial,Zhao Y.,2025,Applied Psychology Health and Well Being,"Background: Young adults face emotional problems in their daily lives. Considering that youth are prevalent among mobile internet users, it would be helpful if functions that can intervene in young people's depression and anxiety can be designed based on short video apps. Large language model (LLM)-based AI conversational agents based on short video apps may play an important role in intervening in young adults' negative emotions. Methods: This study is a 28-day randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which 865 participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a waiting group, and each user was asked to engage in a total of 28 days of dialog intervention with the AI agent and complete three psychological questionnaires. Results: The dialog intervention significantly reduced depression in the intervention group at two weeks and significantly reduced both depression and anxiety in the intervention group at four weeks. Conclusions: This study found evidence that the LLM-based conversational agent could effectively alleviate the mild anxiety and depressive symptoms of young adults with negative emotions through dialog interventions when the AI companion bot is used sufficiently enough.

Navigating anxiety in digital learning: How AI-driven personalization and emotion recognition shape EFL students' engagement,Ding Z.,2025,Acta Psychologica,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly integrated into educational contexts, understanding their influence on learners' emotional and cognitive engagement is essential. This study investigates the relationship between AI-driven personalization, emotion recognition, digital learning anxiety, and student engagement among Chinese university students learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Data were collected via an online questionnaire administered between April 21st and April 30th, yielding a valid sample of 493 participants. The instruments were translated and back-translated to ensure linguistic and cultural validity. Using SPSS (version 27) and AMOS (version 24), both correlation and structural equation modeling analyses were conducted. Results showed that AI-driven personalization and emotion recognition were positively correlated with engagement and negatively correlated with digital learning anxiety. Furthermore, mediation analysis indicated that anxiety partially mediated the relationship between AI technologies and engagement. The structural model demonstrated strong fit indices, highlighting the efficacy of AI-based tools in reducing anxiety and enhancing student engagement. These findings underscore the theoretical relevance of the Control-Value Theory and Engagement Theory and offer practical insights for the implementation of emotionally responsive AI systems in EFL digital learning environments.",10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105466,0,Scopus,105015483380,2-s2.0-105015483380,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015483380
Conceptualisation of Digital Wellbeing Associated with Generative Artificial Intelligence from the Perspective of University Students,Černý M.,2025,European Journal of Investigation in Health Psychology and Education,"Digital wellbeing has been the subject of extensive research in educational contexts. Yet, there remains a paucity of studies conducted within the paradigm of generative AI, a field with the potential to significantly influence students’ sentiments and dispositions in this domain. This study analyses 474 student recommendations (information science and library science) for digital wellbeing in generative artificial intelligence. The research is based on the context of pragmatism, which rejects the differentiation between thinking and acting and ties both phenomena into one interpretive whole. The research method is thematic analysis; students proposed rules for digital wellbeing in the context of generative AI, which was followed by the established theory. The study has identified four specific areas that need to be the focus of research attention: societal expectations of the positive benefits of using generative AI, particular ways of interacting with generative AI, its risks, and students’ adaptive strategies. Research has shown that risks in this context must be considered part of the elements that make up the environment in which students seek to achieve balance through adaptive strategies. The key adaptive elements included the ability to think critically and creatively, autonomy, care for others, take responsibility, and the reflected ontological difference between humans and machines.",10.3390/ejihpe15100197,0,Scopus,105020058108,2-s2.0-105020058108,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020058108
Personalised machine-learning decision support for suicidal thoughts and behaviours in the psychiatric emergency department,Gericke F.,2025,Psychiatry Research,"Background: Individuals presenting with psychiatric complaints to the emergency department (ED) are at significant risk of re-referral for suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB) in the short term. The absence of effective tools to identify these high-risk individuals hampers clinical decision-making, necessitating the development of improved, interpretable, and personalised prediction methods. We aimed to predict the risk of suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) within one, six, and 12 months using XGBoost algorithms; and enhance model interpretability through methods in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Methods: This prognostic study conducted the initial development and evaluation of machine learning (ML) models using structured electronic health records (EHR) from 26,198 patients (51,397 referrals) at the psychiatric emergency department (PED) of the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium, from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2022. Results: The models achieved good discriminative ability (Area Under the Curve) ranging from 0·70 [95 % CI: 0·66 to 0·75] to 0·80 [95 % CI: 0·75 to 0·85] and excellent calibration, with Integrated Calibration Index values ranging from 0·001 to 0·004 suggesting reliable predictions. The referrals identified within the five highest-risk ventiles comprised 24·73 – 26·19 % of all referrals, which accounted for 50·43 % –70 % of all STB referrals. The models exceeded the minimum criteria for cost-effective targeting of active contact and follow-up interventions. Applying XAI methods improved the transparency and interpretability of the predictions on a patient level. Conclusion: Enhancing ML models based on PED EHRs with methods in local XAI has the potential to aid clinicians in effectively identifying high-risk individuals for targeted, cost-effective interventions.",10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116698,0,Scopus,105013567447,2-s2.0-105013567447,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013567447
Seeking validation in the digital age: The impact of validation seeking on self-image and internalized stigma among self- vs. clinically diagnosed individuals on r/ADHD,Zhang X.,2025,Plos One,"The digital age has fueled a surge in ADHD self-diagnosis as people turn to online platforms for mental health information. However, the relationship between validation-seeking behaviors and self-perception in these online communities and users’ self-perception has received limited scholarly focus. Drawing on self-verification theory and utilizing natural language processing to analyze 452,026 posts from the r/ADHD subreddit, our study uncovers distinct patterns in validation-seeking behaviors. Results show that (a) self-diagnosed individuals with ADHD are more likely to seek social validation and media validation and to report higher levels of negative self-image and internalized stigma than clinically diagnosed individuals, (b) social validation was strongly associated with both positive and negative self-perceptions; and (c) diagnosis status significantly moderated these relationships, such that the effects of social validation on self-image and stigma were consistently weaker for the self-diagnosed group. Theoretically, this study extends self-verification theory by demonstrating that professional verification hierarchically moderates self-verification effectiveness. This implies a practical need for clinicians to acknowledge online validation seeking and for digital communities to affirm user experiences while mitigating stigma.",10.1371/journal.pone.0331856,0,Scopus,105017505048,2-s2.0-105017505048,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017505048
Cross-national survey data on student attitudes toward artificial intelligence,Skalka J.,2025,Data in Brief,"This data article presents responses from a comprehensive, multi-year survey conducted between 2022 and 2024 at several universities in Central and Eastern Europe, focusing on students' artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, attitudes, and readiness. The data collection was part of a longitudinal project within the FITPED consortium, which built upon previous EU-funded initiatives to support digital education. A total of 1146 university students participated, representing a diverse range of study programs, academic years, and countries, including Slovakia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Indonesia, Turkey, France, and Ukraine. The structured questionnaire was based on validated instruments and included constructs such as AI literacy, AI readiness, AI anxiety, behavioural intention, satisfaction, confidence, perceived relevance of AI, and social goods. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale, and demographic information, including gender, age, year of study, field of study, and previous experience with AI-related courses, was collected. The survey was administered anonymously via Google Forms and the Moodle LMS in multiple languages, ensuring accessibility across disciplines. The dataset supports cross-disciplines and longitudinal comparisons and is suitable for quantitative analytical methods such as factor analysis and structural equation modeling.

AI-driven mixed-methods analysis of technology dependence: Personality-moderated pathways to Oral English anxiety in language learning,Wang X.,2025,Acta Psychologica,"Intelligent education systems are reshaping the language learning ecosystem; however, the psychological mechanisms linking technology dependency (TD) and oral English anxiety (OA) remain under-explored. This study employs a mixed-methods approach grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) and Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986), supplemented by Trait Activation Theory to examine personality moderation associations.Surveying 716 university students in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, it investigates the mediating effects of psychological burden (PB) and digital self-efficacy (DSE) on the TD-OA relationship, alongside the moderating associations of personality traits. Mplus structural equation modelling was combined with Python XGBoost-SHAP machine learning. SEM revealed an asymmetric dual-path mechanism: PB acted as a complementary mediator, amplifying the positive association between TD and OA, while DSE functioned as a competitive mediator, marginally buffering the association with a path ratio of 7.83:1. Personality traits significantly modulated these relationships: Extraversion (EX) enhanced resilience to technology-induced anxiety, while Neuroticism (NEU) amplified vulnerability. Mixed-methods enhanced predictive accuracy by detecting complex nonlinear interactions. The study contributes in two key areas: 1. A dual-process model explaining technology dependence by highlighting differentiated associations through cognitive load and efficacy pathways; 2.A trait adaptation framework that clarifies how personality traits are associated with psychological adaptation in technology learning environments. Practical implications inform the development of “anxiety-sensitive” intelligent tutoring systems. This research advocates for adaptive adjustments based on psychological burden and personality-oriented personalised intervention strategies, emphasizing the importance of protecting learners' mental health while pursuing technological efficiency.",10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105670,0,Scopus,105017453694,2-s2.0-105017453694,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017453694
Al-assisted symbolic healing for digital natives: A Jungian perspective based on the S-O-R and Fogg behavior models,Shang B.,2025,Acta Psychologica,"This study examines the design of emotional healing interventions for Generation Z individuals experiencing anxiety and investigates the mechanisms of AI-assisted collaborative drawing in addressing their needs for personalized and interactive emotional regulation. Drawing on Jungian theory of artistic compensation to evaluate AI-based art therapy, and integrating the S-O-R (Stimulus-Organism-Response) model and the FBM (Fogg Behavior Model), we analyzed how the intelligent mechanisms of AI collaborative painting contribute to emotional healing. We established three art therapy groups—generative AI painting, interactive AI painting, and traditional painting—for comparison. The therapeutic effects were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The findings confirm the superior performance of AI collaborative drawing in enhancing immediacy and feedback, providing personalized support, and improving users' emotional stability. Furthermore, the study explores how AI platforms can develop personalized emotional healing functions that effectively guide emotional expression and processing. The potential of AI collaborative drawing in emotional healing has often been overlooked.

Manufacturing beauty: How AI and Social media are redefining aesthetic norms in emerging digital cultures,Hussain B.,2025,Acta Psychologica,"In the age of algorithmically curated social media, beauty standards are increasingly co-produced by platform design and AI-driven filters. This study investigates the impact of AI-powered beauty filters and recommendation systems on TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat on body image and aesthetic preferences among young women in urban Pakistan. Guided by critical media theories of algorithmic power and postcolonial beauty norms, we utilize a mixed-methods approach that combines a structured survey (N = 300) with in-depth interviews (N = 30). The quantitative survey employed validated Likert scales to measure the frequency of filter use, body dissatisfaction, awareness of digital manipulation, and preference for Eurocentric facial features. Linear regressions and moderation analysis tested three hypotheses. Results confirmed a robust positive relationship between filter use and body dissatisfaction (β = 57, p < .001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.42) as well as a very strong link between time spent on social media and preference for Eurocentric features (β = 0.46, p < .001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.75). Awareness of digital distortion did not significantly weaken the filter–dissatisfaction association (interaction p = .38). Interview data revealed a deep internalization of algorithmic beauty norms, showing that many women relied on filters for social validation despite recognizing their artificiality, echoing broader patterns of algorithmic visibility bias. These findings indicate that AI-curated beauty ideals can exacerbate body anxiety and colorism pressures in a Global South context. We discuss implications for media literacy, platform governance, and culturally sensitive interventions to resist the algorithmic colonization of aesthetics.",10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105734,0,Scopus,105018095118,2-s2.0-105018095118,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018095118

From Likes to Lifeworlds: The Contributions of Youth Work Practice in the Online Lifeworld to Young People’s Development,Todorovic D.,2025,Social Sciences,"As youth workers increasingly offer support and guidance within digital environments, the question arises as to what impact this support has on the (online) lives of young people. This paper explores the contribution of youth work practice in the online lifeworld on young peoples’ development, building on previous studies concerning youth work outcomes and the developmental needs of young people. A qualitative research design was employed, including digital diaries of youth workers and semi-structured interviews with both young people (N = 37) and youth workers (N = 25). The findings highlight the role of youth work in helping young people navigate social media; develop new skills, talents, and social connections; and increase awareness of online risks. Youth workers also support young people in coping with negative online experiences, including loneliness and mental health challenges. The contribution of online youth work is less visible in certain aspects of developmental needs, namely online safety and privacy, self-image, and assessing online information. This paper concludes by emphasising the need for further research into the long-term impact of youth work in the online lifeworld, particularly in light of rapid technological developments, the growing influence of artificial intelligence, and the increasing involvement of youth in digital forms of crime. The findings described in this study can form a base for future research to better understand the impact of these emerging issues on youth development and youth work practice, as well as to develop appropriate interventions.",10.3390/socsci14100618,0,Scopus,105019971644,2-s2.0-105019971644,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019971644
Apply Machine Learning to Predict Risk for Adolescent Depression in a Cohort of Kenyan Adolescents,Do H.,2025,Healthcare Switzerland,"Background: Adolescent depression is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Identifying top key risk factors is necessary to inform effective prevention program design. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful approach to analyze complex multidomain of data to identify the most relevant predictors and estimate risks for mental health problems. This paper applies ML to study risks for adolescent depression to enhance adolescent depression prevention efforts in LMICs. Methods: Six ML approaches (e.g., Explainable Boosting Machine, random forests, and XGBoost) were applied to study the risks of depression. Data were drawn from a digital health intervention study conducted in Kenya (year 2024–2025, n = 269). Multiple domains of childhood and adolescent adversity and stress experiences were used to predict adolescent depression (using PHQ9-A). Findings: We found that ML was a valuable approach in the early identification of adolescents at risk for depression. Among the six ML approaches applied, the random forest approach outperformed other ML approaches, especially when multiple domains of risks were included. We also found that childhood adversity or home adversity alone were not strong predictors for depression. Adding adolescent stress experiences and community school adversity experiences significantly improves the accuracy and predictability of depression. Using the top-15 and top-20 ranking factors, we achieved 74.8% and 75.1% accuracy in depression prediction, which was similar to the accuracy when all 49 adverse/stress factors were included in the predictive model (78.3%). Conclusions: Innovative ML and modern predictive modeling approaches have the potential to transform modern preventive mental health care by better utilizing multidomain data to identify individuals at risk for developing depression early and identify top risk factors (for targeted individuals and/or populations). Findings from ML can inform tailored intervention design to better mitigate risks in order to prevent depression problem development. They can also inform the better utilization of resources to target high-need cases and key determinants, which is particularly useful for LMICs and low-resource settings. This paper illustrates an example of how to move toward this direction. Future research is needed to validate the approach.",10.3390/healthcare13202620,0,Scopus,105020193934,2-s2.0-105020193934,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020193934
ChatGPT's Role in Addressing the Real-World Concerns of Adolescents With Hearing Loss: Insights From Otolaryngologists With Lived Experience,Motegi M.,2025,Journal of Adolescent Health,"Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT-generated responses to psychosocial concerns of hearing-impaired adolescents, assessed by otolaryngologists with lived experiences, exploring artificial intelligence's (AI's) potential as complementary support when professional or peer assistance is unavailable. Methods: Twenty scenario-based inquiries spanning 5 domains (interpersonal communication, education, emotional well-being, future aspirations, and hearing aid use) were submitted to ChatGPT-4o on August 25, 2024. Responses were evaluated by 6 board-certified otolaryngologists with lived experiences of adolescent hearing loss using 7 criteria: overall quality, empathy, medical consensus alignment, appropriateness, inquiry comprehension, harm, and age-appropriate comprehensibility. Ratings were assigned on a five-point Likert scale; inter-rater reliability was assessed using Fleiss' kappa. Results: The Fleiss' kappa was 0.442. The mean ratings for all criteria exceeded 4.0, except for overall quality. Logistic regression analysis identified high levels of empathy (odds ratio, 7.189; p < .0001) and inquiry comprehension (odds ratio, 4.163; p = .0185) as significant predictors of high-quality responses. The Kruskal–Wallis test revealed significant differences in ratings for the “medical consensus” criterion across domains (p = .0094). Post hoc analysis indicated that responses in the “emotional well-being” domain (median, 4.0) scored significantly lower than those in the “hearing aid use” domain (median, 5.0) for medical consensus (p = .0058). Discussion: Incorporating evaluators with lived experiences provided a reliable framework for assessing AI's potential as a complementary support tool for hearing-impaired adolescents.

Developing a Psychological Research Methodology for Evaluating AI-Powered Plush Robots in Education and Rehabilitation,Hofmane A.,2025,Behavioral Sciences,"The integration of AI-powered plush robots in educational and therapeutic settings for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) necessitates a robust interdisciplinary methodology to evaluate usability, psychological impact, and therapeutic efficacy. This study proposes and applies a four-phase research framework designed to guide the development and assessment of AI-powered plush robots for social rehabilitation and education. Phase 1 involved semi-structured interviews with 13 ASD specialists to explore robot applications. Phase 2 tested initial usability with typically developing children (N = 10–15) through structured sessions. Phase 3 involved structured interaction sessions with children diagnosed with ASD (N = 6–8) to observe the robot’s potential for rehabilitation, observed by specialists and recorded on video. Finally, Phase 4 synthesized data via multidisciplinary triangulation. Results highlighted the importance of iterative, stakeholder-informed design, with experts emphasizing visual properties (color, texture), psychosocial aspects, and adjustable functions. The study identified key technical and psychological evaluation criteria, including engagement, emotional safety, and developmental alignment with ASD intervention models. Findings underscore the value of qualitative methodologies and phased testing in developing child-centered robotic tools. The research establishes a robust methodological framework and provides preliminary evidence for the potential of AI-powered plush robots to support personalized, ethically grounded interventions for children with ASD, though their therapeutic efficacy requires further longitudinal validation.

This highlights an urgent need for effective toxicity detection methods tailored to these platforms. Traditional rule-based approaches are inherently limited, and the performance of predictive models in detecting online toxicity is critically dependent on the quality and representativeness of their training data. However, the distinct linguistic characteristics of discourse on gaming networks present unique challenges in curating representative training samples using existing valence lexicons, often resulting in suboptimal detection accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel framework for online toxicity detection on gaming platforms that addresses these linguistic challenges. Our approach introduces an extended embeddings-based valence lexicon that can be customized to any gaming platform. In this study, we specifically target Twitch. Through a comprehensive comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art lexicon-based techniques, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance. Notably, agreement analysis reveals a moderate alignment between human annotators and the proposed method, with a kappa score of 0.619. Experimental results further underscore the efficacy of our approach, showing an average performance improvement of 31.47% across LSTM, GRU, and CNN architectures compared to all baseline methods. The findings of this study have significant implications for improving platform-specific toxicity detection, enhancing the safety and inclusivity of gaming environments. The framework can be adapted to other online platforms, offering a scalable solution to address toxicity and protect vulnerable populations.",10.1007/s41060-025-00730-1,1,Scopus,85219167311,2-s2.0-85219167311,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219167311
Severity Classification of Anxiety and Depression Using Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire: National Cross-Sectional Study Applying Classification and Regression Tree Models,Faro A.,2025,Jmir Public Health and Surveillance,"Background: Scalable and accurate screening tools are critical for public mental health strategies, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) are widely used, their full application in large-scale programs can pose feasibility challenges. By contrast, shorter versions like GAD-2 and PHQ-2 reduce burdens but fail to capture symptom diversity. Objective: This study aimed to optimize screening for anxiety and depression severity using classification and regression tree (CART) models, identifying concise and high-performing decision rules based on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 items, and to test their reproducibility in 5 independent datasets. Methods: A cross-sectional, nonprobabilistic study was conducted with 20,585 Brazilian adults from all 27 states and more than 3,000 cities, collected using digital outreach. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9. CART models were trained and tested on bootstrapped samples (70% training, 30% testing), totaling 45,000 trees per scale. Each model used combinations of scale items and sociodemographic predictors. Robustness was evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation and evaluation across 3 hyperparameter configurations (minsplit and minbucket=500, 1000, 2000). Performance metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: The CART models produced concise, high-performing decision rules-using only 2 items for the GAD-7 and 3 for the PHQ-9. No sociodemographic variable appeared in the final classification paths. For GAD-7, the models achieved an accuracy of 86.1% for minimal or mild severity and 85.1% for severe cases, with both categories showing AUC values above 0.900. By contrast, the moderate severity class had lower performance, with accuracy around 51% and an AUC of 0.728. For PHQ-9, the models achieved 81.7% accuracy for minimal or mild cases and 78.8% for severe cases, with AUCs again exceeding 0.900 for the extreme classes; the moderate or moderately severe class showed 66.9% accuracy and an AUC of 0.776. The most frequently repeated rules included the following: ""GAD2<2 and GAD4<2"" for identifying minimal or mild anxiety and ""GAD2≥2 and GAD4=3"" for severe anxiety; for depression, ""PHQ2<2and PHQ4<2"" for minimal or mild cases and ""PHQ2≥2 and PHQ8≥2"" for severe cases. These rule-based models demonstrated stable performance across thousands of bootstrapped replications and showed reproducibility in 5 independent datasets through external validation. Conclusions: CART models enabled simplified, symptom-specific pathways for stratifying anxiety and depression severity with high precision and minimal item burden. These rule-based shortcuts offer an efficient alternative to fixed short forms (eg, GAD-2, PHQ-2) by preserving symptom diversity and severity discrimination. The findings support and lay the groundwork for adaptive, cost-effective screening and intervention models, especially in resource-limited settings and LMICs.",10.2196/72591,0,Scopus,105017572007,2-s2.0-105017572007,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017572007
Harnessing digital phenotyping to advance university student mental health (Brightline) in Singapore: study protocol for a prospective observational study,Ito S.,2025,BMJ Open,"Introduction Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety are highly and disproportionally prevalent among university students. Beyond the academic rigour, stressors imposed by a new environment result in them being vulnerable to the onset and manifestation of mental health symptomatology. Leveraging smartphones and wearables for digital phenotyping capabilities is an innovative approach for monitoring and intervening in the mental health conditions of university students. This provides a unique opportunity to collect and identify digital and behavioural biomarkers, subsequently enabling the development of predictive models to identify university students at risk. Methods and analysis This study—Brightline—will employ an observational study design over a 6-month period, recruiting 500 students from a major public university in Singapore. Passive data collection will occur continuously throughout the monitoring period through a wearable device (Fitbit Charge 6) and smartphone sensors via the Brightline app, which uses a digital phenotyping data collection platform. Active data collection will consist of self-report questionnaires to be completed at the beginning of the study and follow-up assessments at 1, 3 and 6months after. The passive and active data collected will be analysed to identify the digital biomarkers associated with depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and affect among university students. Predictive models of these mental health issues will also be developed. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Nanyang Technological University Institutional Review Board (IRB-2023-894). Findings from this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences.

Nonlinear Mediation of Parental Phubbing on Child Loneliness: SHAP Interpretability and Double Machine Learning Insights,Hao J.,2025,Proceedings of 2025 6th International Conference on Education Knowledge and Information Management Icekim 2025,"Objective Grounded in social-ecological theory and parent-child system theory, this study investigates the mechanism by which parental phubbing (excessive smartphone use during parent-child interactions) influences children's loneliness, with a focus on the chained mediation effects of parent-child cohesion and children's social anxiety. Existing research predominantly employs parallel mediation models, overlooking the sequential transmission between parent-child interactions and social development, while traditional regression analyses fail to capture nonlinear relationships in behavioral data. Methods Utilizing scales for parental phubbing, children's loneliness, parent-child cohesion, and social anxiety, we conducted a questionnaire survey with 300 fourth- to sixth-grade students from a primary school in Shanxi Province. Predictive models were constructed using Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) and a double machine learning framework, with variable contributions analyzed via SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values, and chained pathways validated through mediation random forests. Results Parental phubbing exhibited a direct effect on loneliness (β = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.21-0.37). The chained mediation effects of parent-child cohesion (β = -0.24) and social anxiety (β = 0.18) were significant (total indirect effect = 0.041), with a nonlinear threshold effect: when parent-child cohesion scores fell below 3.2, the mediation effect intensity increased by 1.7-fold. Conclusion This study reveals a nonlinear dose-response relationship between parental smartphone use and children's psychological distress, providing quantitative evidence for targeted interventions.",10.1145/3756580.3756612,0,Scopus,105020253172,2-s2.0-105020253172,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020253172
The predictive performance of behavioral-psychological factors on anxiety symptoms of varying severity among Chinese college students,Zhou R.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: The increasing prevalence of anxiety symptoms considerably impacts college students' mental health. Existing research is insufficient in predicting varying levels of anxiety severity, especially regarding the comprehensive predictive power of behavioral-psychological factors. Method: A convenience sampling method was used to survey 6, 543 college students in five major regions of China in November 2021. The online scales included the MPAI, BPS, AIS, FoMOs, and DASS-21. Three ROC prediction models were constructed using multinomial ordinal logistic regression to explore the predictive roles of a combination of four behavioral-psychological factors —problematic mobile phone use (PMPU), bedtime procrastination, insomnia, and fear of missing out (FoMO)—on anxiety symptom severity levels. Results: More than 80 % of respondents reported experiencing anxiety symptoms at varying levels of severity. The multinomial ordinal logistic regression revealed that bedtime procrastination, insomnia, and FoMO were significant positive predictors of all anxiety levels (p < 0.001). FoMO had the strongest predictive effect, increasing with rising anxiety levels. PMPU was not statistically significant for mild anxiety. ROC curve analysis revealed that the Roc-A factors demonstrated good predictive performance for anxiety levels, with AUCs ranging from 0.67 to 0.89, significantly outperforming the model containing only sociodemographic factors. Conclusion: The multi-model combination constructed based on four behavioral-psychological factors has good predictive performance for anxiety symptoms of different severity among Chinese college students. The predictive performance increases with increasing anxiety level in individuals with anxiety symptoms, providing a theoretical basis for the early identification of anxiety level.",10.1016/j.jad.2025.119408,0,Scopus,105005195915,2-s2.0-105005195915,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005195915
The predictive ability of selfies and internet addiction on social appearance anxiety among Jordanian private university students,Mabreah S.,2025,Journal of Education and E Learning Research,"The present study investigates whether selfies and Internet addiction predict social appearance anxiety among students at private Jordanian universities, considering the impact of gender, specialization, and academic stage using a descriptive correlational approach. 1,500 male and female students from private universities in Jordan participated in this study, selected through a non-probability convenience sampling method. Three measures were employed to achieve the study's results: the Selfie Inventory (SI), the Internet Addiction Inventory (IAI), and the Self-Administered Addiction Inventory (SAAI). Students at Jordan's private universities reported a medium level of selfies and Internet addiction. In contrast, social appearance anxiety was low. The results also revealed that the predictive model of the variables influencing social appearance anxiety was statistically significant (α = 0.05), with a joint contribution of the independent variables accounting for 45.00%. Selfies contributed the most, with a relative effect, explaining 38.30% of the total variance. Internet addiction accounted for 6.70% of the total variance. When selfies increase by one standard unit, social anxiety rises by 0.840. Similarly, when Internet addiction increases by one standard unit, social anxiety rises by 0.713 of a standard unit.",10.20448/jeelr.v12i4.7416,0,Scopus,105016483273,2-s2.0-105016483273,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016483273
Students’ attitudes towards using information and communication technology for the purpose of counselling,Dlaza Z.,2025,Transformation in Higher Education,"Technology is widely utilised as a learning tool in higher education, yet its adoption in counselling services within institutions remains limited. The growing use of online counselling is recognised internationally in providing mental health services. However, this mode of delivering mental health services is generally under-explored in South African universities. Research suggests that it is essential to determine the extent to which clients would be interested in using online counselling before implementing it. Therefore, this study investigates university students’ attitudes towards the use of online counselling services and explores the significance of age and gender differences in these attitudes. Data were gathered from students through self-administered questionnaires, with a total of 266 respondents (N = 266). The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings confirmed a generally mixed attitude towards online counselling, which was not significantly influenced by gender and age differences. Overall, the findings encourage a critical reflection on modern psychological practices in higher education institutions to better meet students’ needs. Contribution: This study explores the evolving digital landscape in higher education and its impact on student well-being, with a focus on information and communication technology-based counselling in the South African context. By examining students’ attitudes towards these digital interventions, the study contributes to ongoing discussions on the accessibility and effectiveness of mental health support in higher education. The study also acknowledges artificial intelligence’s potential to enhance accessibility, efficacy and ethicality in navigating mental health challenges.",10.4102/the.v10i0.492,0,Scopus,105016167955,2-s2.0-105016167955,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016167955
Analyzing Depression in College Students Using NLP and Transformer Models: Implications for Career and Educational Counseling,Wan Q.,2025,Brain and Behavior,"Purpose: Depression among college students is a growing concern that negatively affects academic performance, emotional well-being, and career planning. Existing diagnostic methods are often slow, subjective, and inaccessible, underscoring the need for automated systems that can detect depressive symptoms through digital behavior, particularly on social media platforms. Method: This study proposes a novel natural language processing (NLP) framework that combines a RoBERTa-based Transformer with gated recurrent unit (GRU) layers and multimodal embeddings. The Transformer captures nuanced language patterns, while the GRU layers account for the sequence of user posts over time. Multimodal embeddings—including behavioral, temporal, and contextual metadata—enhance the model's ability to interpret subtle emotional cues in social media posts. Findings: The model was evaluated on real-world datasets from Twitter and Reddit, achieving an accuracy of 90.18% in classifying depressive versus non-depressive posts. It also demonstrated consistently high performance across both simple and complex sentence types. Statistical comparison with several baseline models confirmed the superiority of the proposed method, particularly over traditional deep learning architectures. Conclusion: By enabling real-time detection of depressive signals in social media content, the proposed framework can serve as a practical tool in academic and career counseling. It supports early identification of at-risk students and facilitates timely interventions, contributing to improved student well-being, retention, and long-term success.",10.1002/brb3.70828,0,Scopus,105015379434,2-s2.0-105015379434,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015379434
"Trial, Error, and Insight: Using the Pilot Study of the HOPE Program to Inform Next Steps for Digital Single-Session Research for Eating Disorders",O'Dea B.,2025,International Journal of Eating Disorders,"Digital single-session interventions (D-SSIs) are emerging as promising tools for bridging treatment gaps in youth mental health. Negi and Forbush's recent pilot study introduces “Help for Overcoming Problem Eating” (HOPE), a D-SSI targeting binge-spectrum eating disorders in university students. Their findings suggest preliminary acceptability, feasibility, and symptom improvements, contributing to the growing evidence-base for D-SSIs in disordered eating. This commentary outlines five key challenges that must be addressed to translate pilot findings into real-world impact. First, the uptake of D-SSIs is often low, likely due to help-seeking barriers and septicism towards this approach. Peer-led, promotional campaigns may boost engagement of D-SSIs in young people. Second, despite their brevity, D-SSI completion is not assured. Strategies such as automated reminders, peer or AI-guided support, and youth co-design may improve adherence. Third, economic evaluations are rare but critical for determining whether D-SSIs offer cost-effective support within resource-limited student services. Fourth, trials should examine mechanisms and durability of change, with complementary D-SSIs offering promising directions. Finally, meaningful integration into care pathways is critical. D-SSIs may serve as stand-alone supports, early engagement tools, or components of stepped-care models. Lack of response could signal the need for intensive care, while successful use may increase openness to further help-seeking. Addressing these challenges with informative, implementation-ready trials will be key to realizing the full potential of D-SSIs in addressing eating disorders in university students and advancing youth mental health care more broadly.",10.1002/eat.24487,0,Scopus,105008231675,2-s2.0-105008231675,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008231675
Metacognitions about generative AI use: psychometric and network analysis among Chinese college students,Xie Y.,2025,Education and Information Technologies,"This study aimed to develop and validate the Metacognitions about Generative AI Use Scale (MGAUS) to assess college students’ metacognitive beliefs about generative AI and to explore these metacognitions as predictors of generative AI addiction risk. A total of 1229 college students from China participated in the study, providing data through an online questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis initially determined the MGAUS’s structure, revealing two primary factors: “Positive metacognitions about generative AI use” and “Negative metacognitions about generative AI use”, comprising nine items in total. Confirmatory factor analysis further validated the scale’s stability and fit, as well as tested measurement invariance across gender, age, and educational levels. Correlation analysis indicated significant positive correlations between both positive and negative metacognitions and generative AI addiction. Additionally, negative metacognitions were significantly positively correlated with anxiety, whereas the correlation between positive metacognitions and anxiety was not significant. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that, after controlling for gender, both positive and negative metacognitions remained significant predictors of generative AI addiction, with negative metacognitions demonstrating stronger predictive power. A network analysis of the scale items further illuminated the close relationship between positive and negative metacognitions. Taken together, these findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of metacognition in the context of generative AI use and provide a scientific foundation for the prevention and intervention of generative AI addiction.",10.1007/s10639-025-13584-8,0,Scopus,105003763580,2-s2.0-105003763580,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003763580
Construction of extra-large scale screening tools for risks of severe mental illnesses using real world healthcare data,Liu D.,2025,Schizophrenia Research,"Importance: The prevalence of severe mental illnesses (SMIs) in the United States is approximately 3 % of the whole population. The ability to conduct risk screening of SMIs at large scale could inform early prevention and treatment. Objective: A scalable machine learning based tool was developed to conduct population-level risk screening for SMIs, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, psychosis, and bipolar disorders, using 1) healthcare insurance claims and 2) electronic health records (EHRs). Design, setting and participants: Data from beneficiaries from a nationwide commercial healthcare insurer with 77.4 million members and data from patients from EHRs from eight academic hospitals based in the U.S. were used. First, the predictive models were constructed and tested using data in case-control cohorts from insurance claims or EHR data. Second, performance of the predictive models across data sources was analyzed. Third, as an illustrative application, the models were further trained to predict risks of SMIs among 18-year old young adults and individuals with substance associated conditions. Main outcomes and measures: Machine learning-based predictive models for SMIs in the general population were built based on insurance claims and EHR. Results: A total of 301,221 patients with SMIs and 2,439,890 control individuals were retrieved from the nationwide health insurance claim database in the U.S. A total of 59,319 patients with SMIs and 297,993 control individuals were retrieved from EHRs spanning eight different hospitals from a major integrated healthcare system in Massachusetts, U.S. The obtained predictive models for SMIs achieved AUCROC of 0.76, specificity of 79.1 % and sensitivity of 61.9 % on an independent test set of an all-age case-control cohort from insurance claim data, and AUCROC of 0.83, specificity of 85.1 % and sensitivity of 66.4 % using EHR data. The fine-tuned models for specific use case scenarios outperformed two rule based benchmark methods when predicting 12-month risk of SMIs among 18-year old young adults but had inferior performance to benchmark methods when predicting SMIs among individuals with substance associated conditions in claims data. Conclusion: Performance of our SMI prediction models constructed using health insurance claims or EHR data suggest feasibility of using real world healthcare data for large scale screening of SMIs in the general population. In addition, our analysis showed cross data source generalizability of machine learning models trained on real world healthcare data. Models constructed from insurance claims appear to be transferable to EHR cohorts and vice versa.",10.1016/j.schres.2025.06.024,0,Scopus,105009827162,2-s2.0-105009827162,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009827162
"‘What Really Goes on in My Cancer Bubble, They Cannot Understand’: Social Functioning Among Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Cancer Patients",Sleeman S.H.E.,2025,Current Oncology,"Cancer during adolescence and young adulthood (AYA; 18–39 years) can disrupt age-related milestones and impair social functioning. Many AYA patients report unmet social support needs and relationship changes, leading to isolation. This mixed-methods study explores social challenges among AYA patients actively seeking support through a communication tool, the ‘AYA Match app’, supporting communication with loved ones. Upon downloading the app, participants completed questionnaires on social support (MOS-SSS) and social functioning (EORTC CAT) and open-ended questions about social challenges. Eligibility included a first cancer diagnosis at AYA age and fluency in Dutch. The findings show that cancer negatively affected AYA patients’ social functioning. Physical limitations and difficulty relating to peers caused isolation and feelings of loneliness. Some preferred solitude or withheld emotions to protect loved ones. Challenges included forming new relationships, feeling left behind as peers reach milestones, and struggling with a changed life perspective. Participants with children reported less social support. This study highlights the complex social challenges AYA cancer patients face. While support from loved ones is crucial, it may not always be effective. Personalized interventions like peer support, improved family communication, and tailored digital tools are needed to improve social well-being and quality of life in AYAs with cancer.",10.3390/curroncol32090501,0,Scopus,105017033146,2-s2.0-105017033146,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017033146
Pilot Testing a Digital Transdiagnostic Mental Health Intervention for Use Among Immigrant and Refugee Youth in the USA: A Mixed Methods Evaluation of Clinical and Implementation Outcomes,Fabian K.E.,2025,Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science,"Digital mental health interventions show promise for populations with barriers to mental healthcare access, including youth and immigrant and refugee communities. These interventions can provide early screening for mental disorders, symptom monitoring, and connections to further care. This study pilot tests a transdiagnostic digital mental health intervention for immigrant and refugee youth in the United States for preliminary clinical effectiveness and implementation outcomes such as barriers and facilitators to integrating the intervention with the focal population. The pre-post pilot study design took place from May to September 2021. STARS (Sustainable Technology for Adolescents to Reduce Stress) is a transdiagnostic digital mental health intervention that delivers evidence-based psychological content designed to reduce symptoms of common mental disorders like anxiety and depression. Content is delivered via a chatbot that provides daily interactive 10–20-min sessions for 10 days. Participants were immigrant and refugee youth ages 14–25. Baseline assessments were performed followed by a 10-day intervention usage period and follow-up assessment. Measures included symptom severity of common mental disorders, intervention usage statistics, and a usability survey. A subset of participants took part in semi-structured interviews to assess barriers and facilitators to implementation, which was structured according to the CFIR framework. A total of 129 participants ages 14–25 from immigrant and refugee communities enrolled in the study. The majority (62.8%, n = 81) of participants were female, 31.8% were male (n = 41), and 5.4% (n = 7) were non-binary or another gender identity. Participants had been living in the United States for an average of 17.9 years (SD = 11.4), had a mean age of 19.5 (SD = 2.9), and reported 53 countries of origin. Baseline mental health scores were generally high using all measures. Participants completed an average of 7 sessions out of 10 (SD = 3.9). Regression results showed each additional intervention session completed was associated with reductions in mental health severity scores, but these associations were non-significant. Barriers and facilitators to uptake and engagement with the intervention fell into three CFIR categories: characteristics of the intervention, inner setting, and characteristics of individuals. The short, module-based delivery of the intervention was well received, as was personalized content, use of mixed media (text, video, audio), and user control of the intervention (i.e., responses to the chatbot). Barriers included time constraints, technological problems, and perceptions that the content was suitable for younger teenagers. The STARS transdiagnostic digital mental health intervention was well-received by participants and showed initial evidence of suitability for immigrant and refugee youth in the United States. More research is needed to maximize clinical effectiveness and bridge the gap between publicly available online mental health resources and evidence-based digital mental health interventions tailored to specific populations.",10.1007/s41347-024-00471-1,0,Scopus,85217803445,2-s2.0-85217803445,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217803445
Using machine-assisted topic analysis to expedite thematic analysis of free-text data: Exemplar investigation of factors influencing health behaviours and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic,Ward E.,2025,British Journal of Health Psychology,"Objectives: Investigate the use of machine learning to expedite thematic analysis of qualitative data concerning factors that influenced health behaviours and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Qualitative investigation using Machine-Assisted Topic Analysis (MATA) of free-text data collected from a prospective cohort. Methods: Free-text survey data (2177 responses from 762 participants) of influences on health behaviours and wellbeing were collected among UK participants recruited online, using Qualtrics at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the COVID-19 pandemic started. MATA, which employs structural topic modelling (STM), was used (in R) to discern latent topics within the responses. Two researchers independently labelled topics and collaboratively organized them into themes, with ‘sense checking’ from two additional researchers. Plots and rankings were generated, showing change in topic prevalence by time. Total researcher time to complete analysis was collated. Results: Fifteen STM-generated topics were labelled and integrated into six themes: the influences of and impacts on (1) health behaviours, (2) physical health (3) mood and (4) how these interacted, partly moderated by (5) external influences of control and (6) reflections on wellbeing and personal growth. Topic prevalence varied meaningfully over time, aligning with changes in the pandemic context. Themes were generated (excluding write-up) with 20 h combined researcher time. Conclusions: MATA shows promise as a resource-saving method for thematic analysis of large qualitative datasets whilst maintaining researcher control and insight. Findings show the interconnection between health behaviours, physical health and wellbeing over the pandemic, and the influence of control and reflective processes.",10.1111/bjhp.70017,0,Scopus,105015414432,2-s2.0-105015414432,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015414432
Neural Network Modeling Based on Multimodal IIoT Sensing Data: Psychological Stress Assessment and Industrial Human-Machine Collaboration Early Warning System for University Students,Hong C.S.,2025,Internet Technology Letters,"With the rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), its educational applications extend from equipment monitoring to mental health management. Addressing the limitations of traditional methods (e.g., subjective self-assessment scales) in real-time psychological stress evaluation, this paper proposes a neural network integrating multimodal IIoT data—physiological signals (EEG, HRV), behavioral data (expression, gesture), and interaction logs (text, clickstream)—to build a dynamic fusion and lightweight warning system. The model employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to adaptively allocate data weights (e.g., prioritizing EEG signals by 58% in exam scenarios) and a tensor fusion network (TFN) for feature extraction. An edge-cloud collaborative framework based on federated learning enhances generalization while ensuring privacy through AES-256 encryption, local feature preprocessing, and differential privacy protections during model updates. Experiments on a campus dataset show 89.2% stress classification accuracy (10.7% higher than unimodal approaches), sub-105 ms alert latency, and a 4.7% false alarm rate. Personalized interventions (e.g., counseling) improved stress alleviation by 61.7% for moderate-to-severe cases.

iENDEAVORS: Development and Testing of Virtual Reality Simulations for Nutrition and Dietetics,Quick V.,2025,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Virtual Reality (VR) simulations provide immersive, realistic educational experiences that are increasingly used to enhance teaching and learning in nursing and medicine; however, use in dietetics lags. To fill this gap, four Nutrition Counselor VR simulations were developed collaboratively with the goal of building confidence in dietetic students’ nutrition counseling skills. After formative testing, pilot testing, and refinements, simulations were field tested with 34 dietetic students (91% women; age 25.67 ± 3.79 SD years; 68% White) from four supervised practice programs using a standard protocol administered by trained researchers (N = 5). Students completed a pre-survey, one VR simulation (≥2 times w/varying outcomes), and a post-survey. Online pre- and post-surveys examined changes in nutrition counseling skills, knowledge and self-efficacy, and comfort in using nutrition counseling skills. Paired t-tests revealed significant (p < 0.05) mean differences in nutrition counseling skill self-efficacy (medium effect size, d = 0.46) and comfort in using nutrition counseling skills (large effect size, d = 0.96) between the pre- and post-survey. At post-survey, >75% agreed the simulations helped build their nutrition assessment skills (79%) and counseling skills (88%) and prepared them to work with real patients (97%). Findings suggest the Nutrition Counselor VR simulations provided a realistic and safe learning environment that may be a valuable learning tool for dietetic students.",10.3390/ijerph22091389,0,Scopus,105017011755,2-s2.0-105017011755,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017011755
Digital Phenotyping of Sensation Seeking: A Machine Learning Approach Using Gait Analysis,Li A.,2025,Behavioral Sciences,"Sensation seeking represents a significant risk factor for various mental health disorders and maladaptive behaviors, highlighting the need for objective assessment methods that circumvent the limitations of traditional self-report measures. This study introduces an innovative digital phenotyping approach that combines computational gait analysis with machine learning (ML) to quantify sensation-seeking traits and examines its validity. Natural gait sequences (using a Sony camera at 25 FPS) and self-report measures (Brief Sensation-Seeking Scale for Chinese, BSSS-C) were collected from 233 healthy adults. Computer vision processing through OpenPose extracted 25 skeletal keypoints, which were subsequently transformed into a hip-centered coordinate system and denoised using Gaussian filtering. From these kinematic data, 300 temporospatial gait features capturing various aspects of movement dynamics were derived. Using a supervised ML approach with feature selection, three ML models (SMO Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, and Bagging) were developed and compared through 10-fold cross-validation. The SMO Regression model demonstrated superior performance (r = 0.60, MAE = 3.50, RMSE = 4.59, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.26), outperforming the other approaches. These results establish proof-of-concept for gait-based digital phenotyping of sensation seeking, offering a scalable, objective assessment paradigm with potential applications in clinical screening and behavioral research. The methodological framework presented here advances the field of behavioral biometrics by demonstrating how computer vision and ML can transform basic movement patterns into meaningful psychological indicators.",10.3390/bs15091222,0,Scopus,105017432629,2-s2.0-105017432629,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017432629
Effect of Paxlovid treatment during acute COVID-19 on Long COVID onset: An EHR-based target trial emulation from the N3C and RECOVER consortia,Preiss A.,2025,Plos Medicine,"Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. This study tests whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative to define a cohort of 445,738 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. We emulated a series of six sequential trials: one for each day of a 5-day treatment grace period. For each sequential trial, the treatment group was defined as patients prescribed Paxlovid on the trial start day, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria who remained untreated on the trial start day. We pooled individual record-level data from the sequential trials for analysis. The follow-up period was 180 days. The primary outcome was overall PASC incidence measured using a computable phenotype. Secondary outcomes were incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. We controlled for a wide range of demographic and medical history covariates. Compared to the control group, Paxlovid treatment did not have a significant effect on overall PASC incidence or incident respiratory symptoms. It had a small protective effect against cognitive (relative risk [RR] 0.91; 95% CI [0.84, 0.98]; p=0.019) and fatigue (RR 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.98]; p=0.002) symptoms. Finally, we estimated Paxlovid’s effect on overall PASC incidence across strata of age, COVID-19 vaccination status, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) prior to COVID-19. We found small protective effects among patients aged 65 years or more (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.88, 0.97]; p<0.001; absolute risk difference [ARD] −0.43%; number needed to treat [NNT] 233) and with a CCI of 3 or 4 (RR 0.83; 95% CI [0.75, 0.92]; p<0.001; ARD −1.30%; NNT 76). This study’s main limitation is that the causal interpretation relies on the assumption that we controlled for all confounding variables. Conclusions Although some prior observational studies suggested that Paxlovid held promise as a PASC preventive, this study—with a large, nationally sampled cohort; a contemporary study period; and causal inference methodology—found that Paxlovid treatment during acute COVID-19 had no effect on subsequent PASC incidence. Stratified analyses suggest that Paxlovid may have a small protective effect among higher-risk patients, but the NNT is high. In conclusion, we see Paxlovid as unlikely to become a definitive solution for PASC prevention.",10.1371/journal.pmed.1004711,2,Scopus,105016321632,2-s2.0-105016321632,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016321632
Large language models and retrieval-augmented generation-based chatbot for adolescent mental health,Riansyah A.,2025,International Journal of Advances in Applied Sciences,"Access to fast and efficient information is crucial in today's digital era, especially for teenagers in obtaining mental health services. The manual method used by Youth Information and Counselling Centre (PIK R) to provide mental health information requires significant time and effort. This research presents an AI-based solution by developing a chatbot system using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLM). This chatbot is designed to provide accurate and effective mental health information for teenagers throughout the day. An analysis of a dataset consisting of articles on teenage mental health and data from the Alodokter website was used as the basis for the development of this chatbot. The research results show that the chatbot is capable of providing relevant and accurate information, with evaluations using the recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE) score method yielding an average of ROUGE-1 with a precision of 87.8%, recall of 83.0%, and F1-measure of 84.0%; ROUGE-2 with a precision of 82.8%, recall of 76.8%, and F1measure of 78.2%; and ROUGE-L with a precision of 88.0%, recall of 82.6%, and F1-measure of 83.4%.

Predicting Suicide Attempt Trends in Youth: A Machine Learning Analysis Using Google Trends and Historical Data,Kachlik Z.,2025,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: Suicide remains a leading cause of death among youth, yet effective tools to predict suicide attempts (SA) in individuals under 18 are scarce. This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) models to predict SA in paediatric populations using Google Trends data. Methods: Relative Search Volumes (RSVs) from Google Trends were analysed for terms linked to suicide risk factors. Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC) identified terms strongly associated with SA rates. Based on these, several ML models were developed and evaluated, including Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost, and Linear Regression. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as PCC, mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results: Terms related to suicide prevention and symptoms, including psychiatrist and anxiety disorder, showed the strongest correlations with SA rates (PCC ≥ 0.90). Random Forest Regression emerged as the top-performing ML model (PCC = 0.953, MAPE = 20.12%, RMSE = 17.21), highlighting burnout, anxiety disorder, antidepressants, and psychiatrist as key predictors of SA. Other models’ scores were XGBoost (PCC = 0.446, MAPE = 22.57%, RMSE = 18.03), SVR (PCC = 0.833, MAPE = 42.23%, RMSE = 47.32) and Linear Regression (PCC = 0.947, MAPE = 23.64%, RMSE = 17.66). Conclusions: Google Trends–based ML models suggest potential utility for short-term prediction of youth SA. These preliminary findings support the utility of search data in identifying real-time suicide risk in paediatric populations.",10.3390/jcm14186373,0,Scopus,105017424314,2-s2.0-105017424314,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017424314
Designing a Culturally Adaptive Information Framework for Anxiety Disorders: A Mixed-Methods Thematic Analysis in Malaysia,Zailani A.U.,2025,Journal of Applied Data Sciences,"This study addresses critical gaps in Malaysia's mental health landscape by developing a culturally adaptive framework for anxiety disorder resources, where only 28% of adults recognize symptoms due to cultural stigma and poor resource design. Our key contribution is a user-centered framework integrating visual-interactive tools with cultural adaptation strategies to improve accessibility and literacy. The objective was to investigate how information design can overcome barriers, using a mixed-methods approach with 12 anxiety disorder patients (screened via DASS-21). Findings revealed: (1) format preferences (infographics: 40%, videos: 35%, simulations: 25%), (2) accessibility barriers (technical language: 45%, lack of credible sources: 65%, insufficient examples: 30%), and (3) demand for demographic personalization (age-targeted content: 78%, mood-tracking tools: 62%). Quantitative results showed strong alignment between preferred formats and comprehension gains (infographics improved understanding by 40% vs. text). The novelty lies in merging cognitive load theory with Malay cultural values (familial collectivism, Islamic coping mechanisms) into actionable design principles. Our framework demonstrates that culturally tailored visual-interactive content increases engagement by 35-40% compared to generic materials, while simplified Malay Language reduces stigma-related avoidance by 28%. These ideas translate into three evidence-based strategies: (a) minimalist visual formats to reduce cognitive load, (b) family-involved examples to respect collectivism, and (c) hybrid delivery (online/offline) for rural accessibility. The study provides policymakers with metrics-backed guidance, showing SMS-based hybrid tools achieve 58% adherence in low-bandwidth areas versus 22% for chatbots. Future work should validate scalability in larger cohorts and test AR/VR adaptations (requested by 70% of youth participants).

Electronic Health Record–Integrated Legal Documentation to Measure Involuntary Mental Health Detention of Children,Edgcomb J.B.,2025,Jaacap Open,"Objective: To examine the prevalence and correlates of child involuntary mental health detentions through evaluation of legal documentation embedded in medical records and children's electronic health information. Method: Medical records were analyzed from 3,440 children ages 10 to 17 years with MH-related emergency department visits in a large academic health system over 2 years (2017-2019). Bivariate analyses and random forests were deployed to identify child-, neighborhood-, and systems-level correlates of involuntary MH detentions. Results: Nearly 1 in 4 (n = 769, 22.4%) visits involved an involuntary detention. Half of detained children (n = 357, 46.4%) arrived on a detainment that was discontinued after MH provider evaluation. Odds of detention were greater among Black (odds ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.02-1.73]) and publicly insured (odds ratio 1.63 [95% CI 1.37-1.94]) children. Children detained in prehospital settings resided in census tracts with greater social vulnerability scores (χ<sup>2</sup> 13.42, p < .001). Machine learning classifiers (area under the curve 0.83, [95% CI 0.81-0.84]) revealed that strongest indicators of detainment included psychiatric chief concern, prior year psychiatric hospitalization, Social Vulnerability Index, and ICD-10-CM code for suicide or self-harm. Conclusion: Medical record–embedded legal documentation supports transparency in the use of detentions, which are common and jointly predicted by children's clinical need and social vulnerability. Plain language summary: Study finds that clinical need and social vulnerability jointly predict child involuntary mental health detention. Linking electronic-format detainment orders to emergency department (ED) health records within a large urban health system in Los Angeles, the team discovered factors associated with detainment including suicide-related diagnoses, use of antipsychotic medications, history of psychiatric hospitalizations, child's age, location of the ED visit, and neighborhood social vulnerability. Findings highlight the growing role of informatics in understanding critical emergency care processes in child psychiatry.",10.1016/j.jaacop.2024.09.001,1,Scopus,105014289562,2-s2.0-105014289562,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014289562
"Preconception educational interventions for women, present landscape, gaps, and future directions: A scoping review",Liu S.,2025,International Journal of Nursing Studies,"Purpose: To summarize studies on educational interventions in preconception care for non-pregnant women of reproductive age. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute and Arksey and O'Malley frameworks. Seven electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Database, PsycINFO) were searched from inception to April 19, 2024. The study types included randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled studies. Results: A total of 34 articles encompassing 29 studies (27 randomized controlled trials) were included in this review. Among these, 17 studies (58.6 %) targeted general preconception women, while the remaining studies focused on specific populations, such as women with higher body mass index (BMI), low income, teenagers with diabetes, risk drinking, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or tobacco use. Preconception educational interventions were predominantly delivered by healthcare professionals, with minimal research involving multidisciplinary team collaboration. The interventions were primarily categorized into two types. in-person education (24 studies, 82.8 %) and technology-based education (12 studies, 41.4 %). Six studies combined both types, and one study included two groups using different approaches. In-person education included group sessions (16 studies, 55.2 %), one-on-one sessions (10 studies, 34.5 %), and printed materials (8 studies, 27.6 %). Technology-based methods involved websites/chatbots (6 studies, 17.2 %), texts/calls/emails (5 studies, 17.2 %), and digital materials (2 studies, 6.9 %). Notably, 16 studies (51.7 %) used multiple educational methods. The intervention content covered 15 key preconception health domains. The most frequently addressed domain was “healthy lifestyle” (22/29, 75.9 %), but 12 studies (41.4 %) covered only a single domain. Preconception educational interventions demonstrated positive impacts on women's knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, mental health, and biometric indicators. However, evidence on their effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes, as well as on mental health and biometric indicators, remains limited. Conclusion: Preconception educational interventions have shown clear benefits across various aspects of women's health. However, current evidence reveals several critical gaps. Strengthening the distribution and accessibility of preconception health resources, especially in low- and middle-income countries, remains essential. Future research should focus on high-risk populations, adopt multidisciplinary approaches, and integrate comprehensive intervention strategies. Broader coverage of preconception health domains is also needed. Moreover, further studies on maternal and neonatal outcomes, mental health, and biometric indicators are vital to reinforce the evidence base and guide practice.

Identification of College Students’ Postgraduate Entrance Examination Situation Based on LDA Topic Modeling,Wang N.,2025,Proceedings of 2025 6th International Conference on Computer Information and Big Data Applications Cibda 2025,"Understanding how university students make decisions about the Postgraduate Entrance Examination is important. It can help improve national education policies. This study uses data from social media platforms like Weibo, Zhihu, and Xiaohongshu. The study gathered comments related to the Examination through Python web scraping methods. After processing the data, the researcher applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to find 13 key topics. These topics cover policies and information, study planning, course reviews, and subsequent steps. The findings indicate that students consider both academic and non-academic aspects. They pay attention to threshold scores and academic requirements. Meanwhile, they also focus on psychological well-being and long-term career growth. Based on these insights, the paper suggests boosting the transparency of the Examination, creating psychological support systems for candidates, and advancing career planning education in universities.

"Mood instability as a transdiagnostic predictor of cannabis use in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depression: A natural language processing analysis of electronic health records from 13,025 adolescents",Seker A.,2025,European Psychiatry,"Background Cannabis use is elevated in youth with depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but drivers of this increase remain underexplored. The self-medication hypothesis suggests cannabis is used by patients for mood regulation, a common difficulty in ADHD and depression. This study aimed to examine associations between mood instability and cannabis use in a large, representative clinical cohort of adolescents diagnosed with ADHD and/or depression. Methods Natural language processing (NLP) approaches were utilised to identify references to mood instability and cannabis use in the electronic health records of adolescents (aged 11-18 years) with primary diagnoses of ADHD (n = 7,985) or depression (n = 5,738). Logistic regression was used to examine mood instability as the main exposure for cannabis use in models stratified by ADHD and depression. Results Mood instability was associated with a 25% higher probability of cannabis use in adolescents with ADHD compared to those with depression. Following adjustment for available sociodemographic and clinical covariates, mood instability was associated with increased cannabis use in both ADHD (aOR: 1.61 [95% CI: 1.41-1.84]) and depression (aOR: 1.38 [95% CI: 1.21-1.57]) groups. Conclusions This was the first study to explore the differential impact of mood instability on adolescent cannabis use across distinct diagnostic profiles. NLP analysis proved an efficient tool for examining large populations of adolescents accessing psychiatric services and provided preliminary evidence of a link between mood instability and cannabis use in ADHD and depression. Longitudinal studies using direct measures or tailored NLP techniques can further establish the directionality of these associations.",10.1192/j.eurpsy.2025.10095,0,Scopus,105014106595,2-s2.0-105014106595,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014106595
"User-Centered Design of Mica, a Mental Health App Supporting Students in Higher Education",Krass M.,2025,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,"Mental health challenges disproportionately affect Swiss university students, driven by academic, financial, and personal stressors. This study presents mica, a mental health app tailored to students, developed through a user-centered design approach. Insights from a survey of 102 students, expert interviews, and usability testing informed the app’s key features: access to local mental health resources, a self-assessment tool, organizational aid, and multimedia content. The non-functional prototype incorporates 13 functional and 3 non-functional requirements, refined through iterative testing. Unlike existing solutions, mica integrates regional counseling services with a student-focused design. While promising, the study's limitations include sample bias and a short survey period.

Chatbot-Delivered Interventions on Psychological Health Among Young People: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Li J.,2025,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,"Background: There exists a notable disparity in meeting the psychological health needs of young people through available services and resources. Chatbots, enabling synchronous interactions between humans and digital devices, hold promise as a technology to assist in filling the treatment gap. This study aims to systematically evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of chatbot-delivered interventions for young people's psychological health. Methods: We systematically searched 11 databases and search engines covering the publication period from January 2014 to September 2024 to identify eligible interventional studies. Meta-analyses and subgroup analyses were performed on randomized controlled trials to investigate the effectiveness of chatbot-delivered interventions and potential influencing factors. Narrative syntheses were conducted to summarize the feasibility and acceptability of these interventions in all the included studies. Results: We identified 29 eligible interventional studies, of which 13 were randomized controlled trials. The meta-analysis indicated that chatbot-delivered interventions significantly reduced psychological distress, but did not have a significant effect on psychological well-being. The treatment effects observed were influenced by factors including sample type, delivery platform, interaction mode, and response generation approach. Overall, this systematic review demonstrates that chatbot-delivered interventions were feasible and acceptable.

Understanding the factors influencing college students' acceptance and adoption of chatbots for learning: A network analysis,Mao P.,2025,Learning and Individual Differences,"This study used network analysis to comprehensively explore 25 variables (i.e., AI-related factors, cognitive and affective factors, individual characteristics) and to identify relatively central factors influencing students' acceptance and adoption (i.e., behavioral intention, objection to use, actual use) of chatbots-assisted learning in an integrated model. A total of 519 university students participated in the online questionnaire survey. The findings identified six communities, including factors related to students' behavioral intentions (e.g., attitude), objection to use chatbots for learning (e.g., AI learning anxiety), actual use (e.g., social influence); several cognitive and affective factors (e.g., perceived trust); several individual characteristics (e.g., AI literacy); and big-five personality traits. Moreover, the results demonstrated that satisfaction and intrinsic learning motivation played central roles within the network model. This study expands our understanding and provides important practical implications for educators, developers, and users. Educational relevance statement: Based on the data of 519 university students, this study used network analysis to comprehensively explore 25 variables (i.e., AI-related factors, cognitive and affective factors, individual characteristics) and to identify relatively central factors influencing students' acceptance and adoption (i.e., behavioral intention, objection to use, actual use) of chatbots-assisted learning in an integrated model. These results indicated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and AI self-efficacy had close connections with students' behavioral intentions; privacy concern and AI learning anxiety were strongly associated with students' objection to use chatbots-based learning; social influence and facilitating conditions were highly linked with students' actual use behavior in the network model. Additionally, we found that satisfaction and intrinsic learning motivation played central roles in students' acceptance and adoption of chatbots for educational purposes. These findings offer important guidance for educators and developers to promote students' acceptance and adoption of chatbots in the learning process, thereby accelerating the widespread application of this novel technology within the educational domain.",10.1016/j.lindif.2025.102756,0,Scopus,105010965718,2-s2.0-105010965718,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010965718
Stronger Algorithmic Beliefs Were Associated with More Benign Interpretations in Unideal Online Dating Scenarios,Hu J.M.,2025,Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking,"Communication scholars have approached heterogeneous experiences in romantic interactions online from the perspective of algorithmic beliefs. People with higher algorithmic beliefs trust more that algorithms can help them find compatible matches in online dating. Such algorithmic beliefs have been theorized to have their effect through the mechanism of self-fulfilling prophecy. The current study offers a more granular test of the underlying cognitive and emotional mechanisms using a scenario-based design. Undergraduate students (N = 101) who had online dating experiences were randomly assigned to report reactions to 4 of 24 unideal online dating scenarios, producing 404 observation points. Crossed random effects modeling found that participants with higher algorithmic beliefs had more positive interpretations and fewer negative interpretations in unideal online dating situations. However, algorithmic beliefs were not related to distress. Findings suggest that algorithmic beliefs may enhance online dating experiences through facilitating more adaptive appraisal processes and offer insights for potential interventions against online dating burnout.",10.1089/cyber.2025.0085,2,Scopus,105008936054,2-s2.0-105008936054,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008936054
Advancing youth co-design of ethical guidelines for AI-powered digital mental health tools,Figueroa C.A.,2025,Nature Mental Health,"Adolescents and young adults (AYA) often face mental health challenges and are heavily influenced by technology. Digital health interventions (DHIs), leveraging smartphone data and artificial intelligence, offer immense potential for personalized and accessible mental health support. However, ethical guidelines for DHI research fail to address AYA’s unique developmental and technological needs and leave crucial ethical questions unanswered. This gap creates risks of either over- or under-protecting AYA in DHI research, slowing progress and causing harm. This Perspective examines ethical gaps in DHI research for AYA, focusing on three critical domains: challenges of passive data collection and artificial intelligence, consent practices, and risks of exacerbating inequities. We propose an agenda for ethical guidance based on bioethical principles autonomy, respect for persons, beneficence and justice, developed through participatory research with AYA, particularly marginalized groups. We discuss methodologies to achieve this agenda, ensuring ethical, youth-focused and equitable DHI research for the mental health of AYA.",10.1038/s44220-025-00467-7,0,Scopus,105012269195,2-s2.0-105012269195,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012269195
Prediction of early-onset bipolar using electronic health records,Wang B.,2025,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines,"Background: Early identification of bipolar disorder (BD) provides an important opportunity for timely intervention. In this study, we aimed to develop machine learning models using large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data including clinical notes for predicting early-onset BD. Methods: Structured and unstructured data were extracted from the longitudinal EHR of the Mass General Brigham health system. We defined three cohorts aged 10–25 years: (1) the full youth cohort (N = 300,398); (2) a subcohort defined by having a mental health visit (N = 105,461); and (3) a subcohort defined by having a diagnosis of mood disorder or ADHD (N = 35,213). By adopting a prospective landmark modeling approach that aligns with clinical practice, we developed and validated a range of machine learning models, across different cohorts and prediction windows. Results: We found the two tree-based models, random forests (RF) and light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM), achieving good discriminative performance across different clinical settings (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.76–0.88 for RF and 0.74–0.89 for LGBM). In addition, we showed comparable performance can be achieved with a greatly reduced set of features, demonstrating computational efficiency can be attained without significant compromise of model accuracy. Conclusions: Good discriminative performance for models predicting early-onset BD can be achieved utilizing large-scale EHR data. Our study offers a scalable and accurate method for identifying youth at risk for BD that could help inform clinical decision-making and facilitate early intervention.

TdCCA with Dual-Modal Signal Fusion: Degenerated Occipital and Frontal Connectivity of Adult Moyamoya Disease for Early Identification,Ran Y.,2025,Translational Stroke Research,"Cognitive impairment in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) manifests earlier than clinical symptoms. Early identification of brain connectivity changes is essential for uncovering the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in MMD. We proposed a temporally driven canonical correlation analysis (TdCCA) method to achieve dual-modal synchronous information fusion from electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for exploring the differences in brain connectivity between MMD and normal control groups. The dual-modal fusion features were extracted based on the imaginary part of coherence of the EEG signal (EEG iCOH) and the Pearson correlation coefficients of the fNIRS signal (fNIRS COR) in the resting and working memory state. The machine learning model showed that the accuracy of TdCCA method reached 97%, far higher than single-modal features and feature-level fusion CCA method. Brain connectivity analysis revealed a significant reduction in the strength of the connections between the right occipital lobe and frontal lobes (EEG iOCH: p = 0.022, fNIRS COR p = 0.011) in MMD. These differences reflected the impaired transient memory and executive function in MMD patients. This study contributes to the understanding of the neurophysiological nature of cognitive impairment in MMD and provides a potential adjuvant early identification method for individuals with chronic cerebral ischemia.",10.1007/s12975-024-01313-1,0,Scopus,85211367118,2-s2.0-85211367118,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211367118
Mental health literacy and patient-mental health provider relationships among American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American people,Chen X.,2025,Public Health,"Objectives: This study examines the relationship between mental health literacy and the patient-mental health provider relationships, particularly American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American (AI/AN) patients’ access to, trust in, and utilization of mental health professionals and their services. Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey to collect data on mental health literacy and its impact on AI/AN patients' trust and interactions with their mental health providers. Methods: A total of 563 AI/AN adult patients completed the survey, which was disseminated using snowball sampling. We assessed mental health literacy using a multi-component measure and performed linear regressions to examine its associations with key factors including socio-demographic characteristics, mental health care access, trusting in mental health providers/specialists, the frequency of using mental health services, trusting in mental health providers/specialists for general health information and for COVID-19 information, as well as their level of satisfaction with the services received from mental health providers/specialists. Results: We identified mental health literacy as a major factor associated with patient-mental health provider relationships among AI/AN patients. Patients reporting lower levels of mental health literacy were likely to report having no regular access to mental health care, lower levels of trust in mental health providers/specialists, less satisfaction with the services received from mental health providers/specialists, and less trust in mental health specialists for COVID-19 information. Conclusions: Mental health literacy is a key factor influencing the patient-mental health provider relationships among AI/AN patients. Interventions to enhance mental health literacy may improve trust and satisfaction with mental health services in this population.",10.1016/j.puhe.2025.105786,0,Scopus,105005460054,2-s2.0-105005460054,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005460054
A machine learning model exploring the relationship between chronic medication and COVID-19 clinical outcomes,Miró B.,2025,International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy,"Background: The impact of chronic medication on COVID-19 outcomes has been a topic of ongoing debate since the onset of the pandemic. Investigating how specific long-term treatments influence infection severity and prognosis is essential for optimising patient management and care. Aim: This study aimed to investigate the association between chronic medication and COVID-19 outcomes, using machine learning to identify key medication-related factors. Method: We analysed 137,835 COVID-19 patients in Catalonia (February–September 2020) using eXtreme Gradient Boosting to predict hospitalisation, ICU admission, and mortality. This was complemented by univariate logistic regression analyses and a sensitivity analysis focusing on diabetes, hypertension, and lipid disorders. Results: Participants had a mean age of 53 (SD 20) years, with 57% female. The best model predicted mortality risk in 18 to 65-year-olds (AUCROC 0.89, CI 0.85–0.92). Key features identified included the number of prescribed drugs, systemic corticoids, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and hypertension drugs. A sensitivity analysis identified that hypertensive participants over 65 taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) had lower mortality risk (OR 0.78 CI 0.68–0.92) compared to those on other antihypertensive medication (OR 0.8 CI 0.68–0.95). Treatment with inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 was associated to higher mortality in participants aged 18–65, while metformin showed a protective effect in those over 65 (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92). Conclusion: Machine learning models effectively distinguished COVID-19 outcomes. Patients under ACEi or ARBs or biguanides should continue their prescribed medications, which may offer protection over alternative treatments.",10.1007/s11096-025-01955-7,0,Scopus,105012031583,2-s2.0-105012031583,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012031583
Algorithmic Burnout and Digital Well-Being: Modelling Young Adults’ Resistance to Personalized Digital Persuasion,Balaskas S.,2025,Societies,"In an era when AI systems curate increasingly fine-grained aspects of everyday media use, understanding algorithmic fatigue and resistance is essential for safeguarding user agency. Within the horizon of a more algorithmic and hyper-personalized advertising environment, knowing how people resist algorithmic advertising is of immediate importance. This research formulates and examines a structural resistance model for algorithmic advertising, combining psychological and cognitive predictors such as perceived ad fatigue (PAF), digital well-being (DWB), advertising literacy (ADL), and perceived relevance (PR). Based on a cross-sectional survey of 637 participants, the research employs Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and mediation and multi-group analysis to uncover overall processes and group-specific resistance profiles. Findings show that DWB, ADL, and PR are strong positive predictors of resistance to persuasion, while PAF has no direct effect. PAF has significant indirect influences through both PR and ADL, with full mediation providing support for the cognitive filter function of resistance. DWB demonstrates partial mediation, indicating that it has influence both directly and through enhanced literacy and relevance attribution. Multi-group analysis also indicates that there are notable differences in terms of age, gender, education, social media consumption, ad skipping, and occurrence of digital burnout. Interestingly, younger users and those who have higher digital fatigue are more sensitive to cognitive mediators, whereas gender and education level play a moderating role in the effect of well-being and literacy on resistance pathways. The research provides theory-informed, scalable theory to enhance the knowledge of online resistance. Practical implications are outlined for policymakers, marketers, educators, and developers of digital platforms based on the extent to which psychological resilience and media literacy underpin user agency. In charting resistance contours, this article seeks to maintain the voice of the user in a world growing increasingly algorithmic.",10.3390/soc15080232,0,Scopus,105014357628,2-s2.0-105014357628,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014357628

Emotional Intelligence and Adolescents’ Use of Artificial Intelligence: A Parent–Adolescent Study,Piombo M.A.,2025,Behavioral Sciences,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) profoundly shapes adolescents’ digital experiences, presenting both developmental opportunities and risks related to privacy and psychological well-being. This study investigates first the possible generational gap between adolescents and their parents in AI use and trust, and then the associations between the Trait Emotional Intelligence (trait EI), parenting styles, perceived social support, and parental involvement on adolescents’ use and trust in AI-based technologies. Participants were 170 adolescents (aged 13–17) and 175 parents from southern Italy, who completed standardized questionnaires assessing parenting styles, Trait Emotional Intelligence (Trait EI), social support, digital literacy, and use and trust in AI. Adolescents used AI more frequently than parents, especially for school- or work-related support and were more likely to seek behavioral advice from AI. They also showed higher trust in AI data security and the quality of behavioral advice than parents. Moreover, greater trait EI and more authoritative (vs. authoritarian) parenting were associated with less frequent AI use and lower use and trust in AI. In 47 matched parent–adolescent dyads, cluster analysis identified Balanced Users (higher trait EI, authoritative parenting, stronger support, cautious AI use) and At-Risk Users (lower trait EI, authoritarian parenting, lower support, heavier and more trusting AI use) Despite no causal inferences can be drawn due to the correlational nature of the data, the results suggested the importance of considering adolescents’ trait EI and authoritative parenting practices in supporting balanced and critical digital engagement, highlighting the concept of a “digital secure base” as essential for navigating the evolving digital landscape.",10.3390/bs15081142,0,Scopus,105014414342,2-s2.0-105014414342,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014414342
AI and adolescent Relationships: Bridging emotional intelligence and practical guidance,Ricon T.,2025,Computers in Human Behavior Reports,"This study comparatively explores how generative AI models respond to adolescents disclosing experiences of romantic and sexual violence. Using five hypothetical vignettes depicting coercive sexting, psychological abuse, sexual assault, image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), and digital control, we evaluated the responses of four leading AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and LLaMA) in terms of emotional empathy, practical guidance, and ethical awareness. Each vignette was presented three times per model to examine consistency and variability. Prompts were standardized to adolescent disclosures and instructed the AI to respond. A qualitative Thematic analysis was employed to examine the tone, content, and values of each response. ChatGPT and Claude consistently demonstrated stronger emotional resonance and contextual sensitivity. Gemini emphasized legal considerations but often used a detached tone. LLaMA responses were generally minimal and lacked both emotional and ethical attunement. These findings contribute empirically to the evolving discourse on AI in mental health and education by illustrating how specific model architectures align with or fall short of ethical, emotional, and developmental standards. Anchored in Communication Privacy Management Theory and Relational Ethics, this study offers an applied ethical framework for assessing AI responsiveness to sensitive disclosures. While current models show potential, they require development in trauma-informed design and moral reasoning. The findings provide empirical insight for improving AI tools that engage with adolescents in emotionally charged and ethically complex digital contexts.",10.1016/j.chbr.2025.100752,0,Scopus,105010958233,2-s2.0-105010958233,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010958233
Research on College Student Behavior Analysis and Campus Safety Risk Early Warning System Based on Deep Learning and Big Data Analysis,Leng J.,2025,Proceedings of the 2nd Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area International Conference on Digital Economy and Artificial Intelligence Deai 2025,"Campus safety management is an important issue that colleges and universities need to address urgently at present. The traditional management approach is difficult to cope with the demand for safety risk identification under the complex behavioral patterns of students due to the lack of dynamic analysis and prediction capabilities. To this end, this study proposes a campus safety risk early warning system based on deep learning and big data analysis, which takes recurrent neural network (RNN) as the core and realizes dynamic prediction and accurate classification of potential safety risks of students by modeling time series data from multiple sources. The system generates personalized risk scores and classification labels through feature extraction and time-series modeling, and combines with a rule engine to develop targeted intervention strategies. Experimental results show that the system achieves an F1 score of 84% on the test set, which is significantly better than the 70% of the traditional method. Through intelligent interventions, the percentage of high-risk students decreased by 42%, the incidence of mental health problems decreased by 35%, and campus safety incidents decreased by 33%, which verified the practicality of the system and the effectiveness of interventions. The study further shows that the deep learning-based risk prediction and intervention system can effectively improve the intelligent level of campus safety management. The innovation of this study is to combine deep learning technology with the needs of education management to construct an intelligent, data-driven campus safety management framework, which not only improves the efficiency of risk identification and intervention, but also provides a feasible path for the digital transformation of education management.",10.1145/3745238.3745439,0,Scopus,105014739339,2-s2.0-105014739339,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014739339
AI-driven analyzes of open-ended responses to assess outcomes of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) in adolescents with anxiety and depression comorbidity,Garcia D.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Objective: Although patients prefer describing their problems using words, mental health interventions are commonly evaluated using rating scales. Fortunately, recent advances in natural language processing (i.e., AI-methods) yield new opportunities to quantify people's own mental health descriptions. Our aim was to explore whether responses to open-ended questions, quantified using AI, provide additional value in measuring intervention outcomes compared to traditional rating scales. Method: Swedish adolescents (N = 44) who received Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) for eight weeks completed (pre/post) scales measuring anxiety and depression and three open-ended questions (related to depression, anxiety and general mental health). The language responses were quantified using a large language model and quantitative methods to predict mental health as measured by rating scales, valence (i.e., words' positive/negative affectivity), and semantic content (i.e., meaning). Results: Similar to the rating scales, language measures revealed statistically significant health improvements between pre and post measures such as reduced depression and anxiety symptoms and an increase in the use of words conveying positive emotions and different meanings (e.g., pre-intervention: “anxious”, depressed; post-intervention: “happy”, “the future”). Notably, the health changes identified through semantic content measures remained statistically significant even after accounting for the changes captured by the rating scales. Conclusion: Language responses analyzed using AI-methods assessed outcomes with fewer items, demonstrating effectiveness and accuracy comparable to traditional rating scales. Additionally, this approach provided valuable insights into patients' well-being beyond mere symptom reduction, thus highlighting areas of improvement that rating scales often overlook. Since patients often prefer using natural language to express their mental health, this method could complement, and address comprehension issues associated fixed-item questionnaires.",10.1016/j.jad.2025.04.003,1,Scopus,105002678303,2-s2.0-105002678303,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002678303

Exploring artificial intelligence (AI) Chatbot usage behaviors and their association with mental health outcomes in Chinese university students,Zhang X.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Technology dependence has long been a critical public health issue, especially among young people. With the development of AI chatbots, many individuals are integrating these tools into their daily lives. However, we have limited knowledge about the issues related to AI chatbot usage and dependence. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to investigate AI chatbot usage behaviors and their association with mental health outcomes among Chinese university students. A total of 1004 students who met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Our survey revealed that 45.8 % of students reported using AI chatbots in the last month, with most using them one to three days per week (78.5 %) and showing light (38.2 %) to moderate (37.6 %) dependence. University students who use AI chatbots exhibited significantly higher levels of depression (p < 0.01) and a greater proportion scoring in the moderate to high levels of depression compared to non-users (p < 0.01). Among these users, depression was directly associated with higher AI chatbot usage and dependence (β = 0.14 to 0.20, p < 0.05). However, no direct association was found between AI chatbot-related behaviors and mental well-being or resilience (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, resilience may be indirectly linked to AI chatbot usage/dependence via depression (β = −0.077 to −0.052; p < 0.05). In conclusion, AI chatbot usage is relatively common among university students, though overuse and severe dependence are infrequent. AI chatbot usage and dependence are associated with higher levels of depression; however, the causal relationship warrants further investigation.",10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.141,3,Scopus,105001429317,2-s2.0-105001429317,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001429317
Chatbot-Based Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program for University Students With Depressive Symptoms: Intervention Development and Pilot Evaluation,Li Y.,2025,Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,"Background:Depression is a growing concern among university students. Chatbots provide flexible, accessible, personalized psychosocial support. Delivering Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) sessions via chatbots may reduce depressive symptoms in university students.Aim:This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of a chatbot-based MBSR intervention for university students with depressive symptoms.Methods:A rule-based MBSR chatbot was developed and evaluated with a single-group pretest–posttest study for university students in Hong Kong (N = 30) reporting depressive symptoms, followed by the collection of their subjective feedback. The intervention lasted eight weeks. The primary clinical outcome was depression levels, with a range of secondary outcomes.Results:The chatbot-based MBSR program demonstrated satisfying recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. The safety of the program was confirmed by the absence of any adverse events directly related to the intervention, tracked from the onset of the intervention to the completion of data assessment. Significant improvements were observed in both primary and secondary outcomes. Participant feedback highlighted the benefits of the program and its effects on depressive symptoms.Conclusions:The program has shown feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms among 30 university students in Hong Kong. The intervention should now be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with follow-up. This study highlights the potential role of chatbot-based interventions in mental health promotion, nursing, and clinical practice and will inform the subsequent development of innovative digital interventions to address mental health challenges faced by university students.",10.1177/10783903241302092,10,Scopus,85212705604,2-s2.0-85212705604,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212705604
An illustration of multi-class roc analysis for predicting internet addiction among university students,Thity N.T.,2025,Plos One,"The internet is one of the essential tools today, and its impact is particularly felt among university students. Internet addiction (IA) has become a serious public health issue worldwide. This multi-class classification study aimed to identify the potential predictors of IA by four severity levels among university students in Bangladesh. We used cross-sectional survey data from 424 university students from different universities in Bangladesh. Data was collected using a self-reported questionnaire, along with an IA test to assess addiction levels. We identified the important features related to IA using the Boruta algorithm. Predictions were made using different machine learning (ML) (decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVMs), and logistic regression (LR)) models. Their performance was assessed using confusion matrix parameters, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and k-fold cross-validation techniques for multi-class classification problems. The prevalence of severe IA was 3.77% among the participating university students in Bangladesh from July 15 to July 22, 2024. University students’ backgrounds, depression, anxiety, stress, participation in physical activity, misbehaving with family members, memory loss symptoms, and being COVID-19-positive were selected as significant features for predicting IA. Overall, the RF (accuracy = 0.531, sensitivity = 0.200, specificity = 0.986, precision = 1.00, k-fold accuracy = 0.4858, micro-average area under curve (AUC) = 0.7798) more accurately predicted IA compared to other ML techniques. The ML framework for multi-class classification study can reveal significant risk factors and predict this behavioral addiction more precisely. It can help policymakers, stakeholders, and families better understand the situation and prevent this severe crisis by improving policy-making strategies, promoting mental health, and establishing effective university counseling services.

An autoencoder based unsupervised clustering approach to analyze the effect of E-learning on the mental health of Indian students during the Covid-19 pandemic,Banerjee P.,2025,Multimedia Tools and Applications,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the education system in India has changed to remote that is, online study mode. Though there are works on the effect of teaching learning on Indian students, the effect of online mode and associated mental state, particularly when the entire country is going through a crisis could not be found in the literature. Our goal is to analyze data and find some pattern through which we can understand the effectiveness of the online study and also try to figure out the stress level. The dataset we collected from 500 undergraduate college students during April-May, 2021 is in questionnaire format. Our contribution in this paper are - (i) publishing a dataset of student feedbacks, and (ii) designing a data processing pipeline involving autoencoders followed by clustering approach. The dataset is in text format so for our analysis we have converted the dataset into a numerical format using the concept of a binary bag of words. Dimensionality reduction is applied through autoencoder for an effective latent space representation. Finally, for finding patterns out of this dimensionally reduced feature space, we have applied unsupervised learning algorithms - kMeans and DBSCAN. A thorough analysis of the clustering process reveals that the absence of social communication in purely online education provokes isolation irrespective of the urban or rural background of the students. However, it could supplement offline classes as a substantial number of students welcomed the concept of online learning as reported in the data.",10.1007/s11042-024-19983-2,0,Scopus,85203139349,2-s2.0-85203139349,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203139349

Smartphone eye-tracking with deep learning: Data quality and field testing,Zhu G.,2025,Behavior Research Methods,"Eye-tracking is widely used to measure human attention in research, commercial, and clinical applications. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and mobile computing, deep learning algorithms for computer vision-based eye tracking have become feasible for smartphones. This paper presents a real-time smartphone eye-tracking system built upon a deep neural network trained on a dataset of 7.4 million facial images. The tracking performance of the system was benchmarked against an industrial gold-standard EyeLink eye tracker using a reasonably large sample (N = 32). The benchmark test showed that, while the smartphone eye-tracking system was less precise (0.177° vs. 0.028°), its tracking accuracy was comparable to the EyeLink tracker (1.32° vs. 1.20°). To evaluate whether the smartphone eye-tracking system is sensitive enough for real-world application, a field test involving 98 volunteers assessed depressive symptoms using three simple visual tasks on a smartphone: fixation stability, free-viewing, and smooth pursuit. The results showed that using the smartphone eye-tracking system can achieve an accuracy of 76.67% in predicting depressive symptoms. These results demonstrate that smartphone eye-tracking can deliver quality data and has potential in scientific and clinical applications.",10.3758/s13428-025-02718-y,0,Scopus,105008864517,2-s2.0-105008864517,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008864517
Exploring the Impact of Female Student’s Digital Intelligence on Sustainable Learning and Digital Mental Well-Being: A Case Study of Saudi Arabia,Alruwaili N.M.,2025,Sustainability Switzerland,"This study investigates the interplay between adaptive online learning, students’ digital intelligence, sustainable learning, and digital mental well-being among female university students in Saudi Arabia. In response to the growing reliance on digital platforms in higher education, a structured questionnaire was distributed via social media to capture student perceptions of their online learning experiences. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), the analysis revealed that while adaptive online learning is a critical enabler, its influence is most effective when mediated by students’ digital intelligence. The findings highlighted that students with higher digital intelligence are more likely to engage in sustainable learning practices and maintain better mental well-being in digital environments. Furthermore, innovative teaching practices were shown to strengthen these relationships, underscoring the importance of interactive and adaptive pedagogies. This research contributes to the growing discourse on digital education by emphasizing the importance of indirect pathways and learner-centred dynamics in shaping positive educational and psychological outcomes. This study offers practical and theoretical implications for educators, institutions, and policymakers aiming to create inclusive, resilient, and psychologically supportive digital learning environments.

Digital insights: Analyzing the reproductive intentions and influencing factors among urban women in China through online platforms,Xiang J.,2025,Plos One,"Objective To explore how fertility-related sentiments expressed by urban Chinese women varied over time and were framed in online discourse between 2011 and 2024. Methods This study employed natural language processing (NLP), TF-IDF-based semantic analysis, and multinomial logistic regression to analyze user-generated content from Douyin, Xiaohongshu, and Kuaishou. Sentiment categories (positive, neutral, negative) were classified, and predictive variables such as education, marital status, and urban tier were modeled to identify structural correlates of fertility attitudes. Results Negative fertility intentions accounted for 71.0% of all discourse, rising sharply from 56.8% in 2021 to 79.8% in 2024. Neutral and positive expressions comprised 28.5% and 0.5%, respectively. Economic constraints—including housing costs (TF-IDF=2.34)—and environmental concerns (TF-IDF=2.00) predominated in negative sentiment, while child-rearing costs (TF-IDF=4.50) were central to neutral positions. Regression analysis revealed marriage was associated with lower odds of negative intention (OR=0.229, 95% CI: 0.194–0.271), while postgraduate education (OR=2.819) and residence in first-tier cities (OR=4.05) were linked to higher odds. Socio-cultural pressures were the most influential predictors of negative sentiment (OR=11.11, 95% CI: 9.07–12.12). Conclusion Fertility intentions among urban Chinese women increasingly represent conscious adaptations to complex structural realities rather than simple expressions of personal reluctance. This shift reflects a broader societal transition in which autonomy, wellbeing, and ethical responsibility gradually supersede traditional reproductive imperatives. Rather than indicating demographic crisis, these changing intentions mark a natural phase of social development, underscoring the need for institutional reforms and a cultural ethos that affirms reproductive freedom and supports parenthood as an informed, empowered choice.",10.1371/journal.pone.0327570,0,Scopus,105011839809,2-s2.0-105011839809,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105011839809
Ethical aspects and user preferences in applying machine learning to adjust eHealth addressing substance use: A mixed-methods study,Derksen M.E.,2025,International Journal of Medical Informatics,"Background: Digital health interventions targeting substance use disorders are being increasingly implemented. Data science methodology has the potential to enhance involvement and efficacy of these interventions, though application may raise ethical considerations. This study aimed to explore possible ethical aspects and preferences among users of an online digital intervention for substance use and gambling disorder regarding the application of supervised machine learning (ML) methodology. Methods: We recruited participants from a widely used, evidence-based online substance use and gambling intervention from the Netherlands (Jellinek Digital Self-help). Initially, we conducted two online focus groups (n = 5 each) to explore topics related to ethical considerations and user preferences regarding the application of ML for adapting unguided digital interventions. Subsequently, the findings from these focus groups informed the development of an online, quantitative, self-reported questionnaire study regarding this topic (n = 157). Data collection and analyses were guided by the principles of biomedical ethics by Beauchamp and Childress. Results: Our qualitative and quantitative results revealed that digital intervention users found the application of machine learning analyses to be ethically acceptable, although they had difficulties conceptualizing ML applications. Participants believed that it could benefit the intervention and subsequently their well-being. Both qualitative and quantitative results emphasized the importance of preserving user autonomy in applying supervised ML to adjust digital interventions. In addition, based on both data sources we found that digital intervention users trusted Jellinek's integrity to apply ML. Ethical concerns identified in the qualitative data (e.g., data security, human control), were not confirmed in our quantitative findings. Conclusions: This mixed-methods study revealed that users of digital intervention demonstrated limited concern for ethical aspects regarding applying ML to adapt digital interventions. Ethical aspects were primarily pertained to their needs for autonomy and privacy.",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105897,0,Scopus,105001233965,2-s2.0-105001233965,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001233965
Digital augmentation of aftercare for patients with anorexia nervosa: the TRIANGLE RCT and economic evaluation,Treasure J.,2025,Health Technology Assessment,"Background: High-risk patients with complex anorexia nervosa are managed in inpatient/day patient care, but re-admission rates are high, and new treatments are needed. Objective(s): To examine the effectiveness of a digital augmentation of aftercare (ECHOMANTRA). Design: Transition Care In Anorexia Nervosa through Guidance Online from Peer and Carer Expertise was a multicentre, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial. ECHOMANTRA augmented treatment as usual was compared with treatment as usual. Patient–carer dyads were randomised using minimisation on a 1: 1 ratio into ECHOMANTRA + treatment as usual (ECHOMANTRA) or treatment as usual alone. Setting: Specialised United Kingdom inpatient/day patient sites (n = 31) participated. Participants: Patient–carer dyads were randomised (n = 185 in ECHOMANTRA and n = 186 in treatment as usual). Interventions: The digital ECHOMANTRA intervention included self-management tools (recovery tips videos) for patients and task-sharing materials for carers (skill-sharing video), supplemented with guided group chat sessions. All participants randomised to ECHOMANTRA + treatment as usual had access to the psychoeducational materials and joint patient/carer chat sessions were also offered. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was patient distress at 12 months. Other outcomes included patient distress at 18 months, and eating disorder symptoms, social and work adjustment, and carer distress and skills at 12 and 18 months. Results: There was no evidence of an intervention effect on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 outcome for patients (n = 370) at 12 months, estimated effect 0.48, 95% confidence interval −0.20 to 0.23, standardised estimate (0.02, p = 0.87). In the economic analysis, the intervention was dominated by treatment as usual from both a health system and wider societal perspective, as ECHOMANTRA cost more and resulted in fewer quality-adjusted life-years gained. However, the uptake of the interactive component of the intervention (i.e. the facilitated and moderated online groups) was limited, with only 20% of the dyad members attending the pre-set minimal adherence level (i.e. both the patient and carer attending at least four online forum group sessions). The feedback about the intervention was predominantly positive. For example, the group facilitators were rated highly. However, some feedback was that the intervention offered too little, too late, and that a more personalised intervention would be more helpful. Limitations: Participants were diverse (e.g. 20% were being treated under the Mental Health Act), and a large proportion had a range of comorbidities (depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder and autistic spectrum disorders), all factors impacting prognosis. Although efforts were made to enhance inclusion, diversity in terms of gender, sexuality and race was limited, and technological barriers and/or lack of a carer may have led to exclusion. The high level of non-adherence to the group support (80% dyads) may have contributed to the non-significant findings. Conclusions: This guided self-management and task-sharing intervention was reviewed positively by some patients and supporters; however, there was no evidence that the intervention improved outcomes over usual aftercare. Future work: Identifying mechanisms to increase engagement such as a more personalised approach to aftercare to address the diverse needs of this patient group are needed. Greater integration between intensive and step-down services with guidance from peer workers providing support may optimise care.",10.3310/ADLS3672,0,Scopus,105012158406,2-s2.0-105012158406,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012158406
Automatic moderation of visual content: integration of emotions and semantic analysis through deep learning for the safety of young users,Ayadi Y.,2025,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,"Current automated content moderation systems primarily focus on detecting explicit visual content (e.g., violence, nudity) while overlooking its emotional impact on young users—a significant deficiency given rising concerns about youth mental health in digital spaces. To address this research gap, this study presents a new architecture based on a hybrid deep learning model combining visual semantics and emotional contextualization, enhanced by a dynamic ontology, which is capable with greater efficacy identifying harmful content by capturing both objects and their associated emotional triggers. Our architecture integrates: (1) visual feature extraction using EfficientNet-B7 to classify objects and scenes, (2) contextual emotion modeling based on BiLSTM to analyze metadata and emotional indicators, and adaptable semantic ontology to map object-emotion relationships with cultural adaptability. The model generated based on the proposed architecture trained and evaluated the model on 10,000 annotated images (COCO, ImageNet, and a custom social media dataset). The model achieved a F1-score of 89%, outperforming Transformer-based (83%) and rule-based (70%) baselines. Our model detected 100% of inappropriate content (recall). The precision of emotionally complex cases (e.g., violent scenes with neutral objects) reached 88%. The results indicate that emotion-sensitive moderation significantly improves content safety for young users.",10.1007/s12652-025-04979-z,0,Scopus,105007916928,2-s2.0-105007916928,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007916928

Development of prediction models for screening depression and anxiety using smartphone and wearable-based digital phenotyping: protocol for the Smartphone and Wearable Assessment for Real-Time Screening of Depression and Anxiety (SWARTS-DA) observational study in Korea,Shin Y.B.,2025,BMJ Open,"Introduction Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent mental health conditions that significantly affect quality of life and cause societal burdens. However, their detection and diagnosis rates remain low owing to the limitations of the current screening methods. With rapid technological advancements and the proliferation of consumer-grade wearable devices and smartphones, their integration into digital phenotyping research has enabled the unobtrusive screening for depression and anxiety in natural settings. The Smartphone and Wearable Assessment for Real-Time Screening of Depression and Anxiety study aims to develop prediction algorithms to identify individuals at risk for depressive and anxiety disorders, as well as those with mild-to-severe levels of either condition or both. By collecting comprehensive data using smartphones and smartwatches, this study aims to facilitate the translation of artificial intelligence-based early detection research into clinical impact, thereby potentially enhancing patient care through more accurate and timely interventions. Methods and analysis This cross-sectional observational study will enrol up to 2500 participants (at least 1000) aged 19-59 years from South Korea via social media outreach and clinical referrals. The eligible participants must use a compatible smartphone. Each participant will be followed up for 4 weeks. Data will be collected using a custom-developed smartphone application called PixelMood. Active data collection will include daily, weekly and monthly self-report questionnaires incorporating validated scales, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Passive data from smartphones include information on physical activity, location, ambient light and smartphone usage patterns. Optionally, participants using the Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch devices can provide additional data on physiological responses and sleep health. The primary outcome will be the development of machine-learning algorithms to predict depression and anxiety based on these digital biomarkers. We will employ various machine-learning techniques, including random forest, support vector machine and deep-learning models. The secondary outcomes will include the association between digital biomarkers and clinical measures, and the feasibility and acceptability of data collection methods. Various features characterising mobile usage behaviours, physical/social activity, sleep patterns, resting physiological states and circadian rhythms will be exploited to serve as potential digital phenotyping markers. Advanced machine-learning and deep-learning techniques will be applied to multimodal data for model generation. Ethics and dissemination This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea University Anam Hospital (approval number: 2023AN0506). The results of this study will be disseminated via multiple channels. The findings will be presented at local, national and international conferences in relevant fields, such as psychiatry, psychology and digital health.

Development of an explainable machine learning model for predicting depression in adolescent girls with non-suicidal self-injury: A cross-sectional multicenter study,Niu B.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescent girls is a critical predictor of subsequent depression and suicide risk, yet current tools lack both accuracy and clinical interpretability. We developed the first explainable machine learning model integrating multicenter psychosocial data to predict depression among Chinese adolescent girls with NSSI, addressing the critical need for culturally tailored risk stratification tools. In this cross - sectional observational study, our model was developed using data from 14 hospitals. We used five categories of data as predictors, including individual, family, school, psychosocial, and behavioral and lifestyle factors. We compared seven machine learning models and selected the best one to develop final model and the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method were used to explain model prediction. The Random Forest (RF) model was compared against six other machine learning algorithms. We assessed the discrimination using the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) with 95 % CIs. Using the development dataset (n = 1163) and predictive model building process, a simplified model containing only the top 20 features had similar predictive performance to the full model, the RF model outperformed six algorithms (AUROC = 0.964 [0.945–0.975]), demonstrating superior discriminative power and robustness. The top ten risk predictors were Borderline personality, Rumination, Perceived stress, Hopelessness, Self-esteem, Sleep quality, Loneliness, Resilience, Parental care, and Problem-focused coping. We developed a three-tiered, color-coded web-based clinical tool to operationalize predictions, enabling real-time risk stratification and personalized interventions.

A cohort study of predictors of short-term nonfatal suicidal and self-harm events among individuals with mental health disorders treated in the emergency department,Marcus S.C.,2025,Journal of Psychiatric Research,"Background: Patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) for mental health problems have an elevated short-term risk of repeat ED visits, subsequent hospitalization, and suicide. Objective: Use health records to identify predictors of nonfatal suicidal or self-harm events following emergency department visits of individuals with mental health disorders. Methods: Electronic health record data from 2015 to 2022 were used to identify ED visits with mental health diagnoses for individuals 10 and older; extract 408 potential predictors including demographic, historical and baseline clinical characteristics from structured and unstructured data; and subsequent suicidal and self-harm events. We constructed a series of progressively additive logistic regression and gradient tree boosting (GTB) models to evaluate how groups of clinical features influenced likelihood of a nonfatal event 180-days after an ED visit. Results: Records identified 2,445,597 ED episodes and 176,000 subsequent suicidal or self-harm events within 180-days. Individuals experiencing an event relative to those without an event were less likely to be > 65 (3.6 % vs 16.7 %; h = 0.46), more likely to be male (55.7 % vs 40.8 %; h = 0.30) and covered by Medicaid (61.5 % vs 42.2 %, h = 0.39). The final model with 408 clinical features resulted in an AUC of 0.851 (logistic regression) and 0.863 (GTB). Diagnoses of bulimia nervosa (OR = 1.84, p < .0001) and cutting (OR = 2.62, p < .0001) were most highly associated with any subsequent event and suicidal self-harm, respectively.

Uncovering Depression on Social Media using BERT Model,Mohd Rum S.N.,2025,Journal of Advanced Research Design,"The lack of early detection and effective treatment programs for depression has left millions struggling with mental illnesses, including anxiety, sleep disorders and, in severe cases, self-harm or suicide. Adolescents and young adults, who are among the most active users of social media platforms like Twitter, represent a particularly vulnerable demographic. With Twitter often serving as a digital diary where individuals share thoughts and emotions, its data offers a unique opportunity for mental health research. This study explores the potential of leveraging Twitter data to detect depression and identify at-risk individuals. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, this research builds a predictive system that analyses linguistic cues, sentiment and user interactions. The methodology involves integrating and preprocessing data from multiple sources, ensuring a comprehensive and reliable approach to model development.

How Does Deliberate Rumination Influence the Association Between Stigma and Suicide Ideation in Depressed Patients: A Mediation Analysis,Wang M.,2025,International Journal of Mental Health Nursing,"This study examined the relationship between stigma, deliberate rumination and suicidal ideation in individuals with depression. A sample of 195 participants aged 18–61 years (39.0% male, 61.0% female) was recruited from a psychiatric hospital in China. Levels of stigma, deliberate rumination and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS), the Simplified Chinese version of the Event-Related Rumination Inventory (C-ERRI) and the Beck Suicidal Ideation Inventory (BSI), respectively. Mediation analysis and structural equation modelling were employed to test the mediating role of deliberate rumination in the stigma–suicidality association. Among depressed individuals, mean scores were 32.277 (SD = 15.996) for stigma, 17.703 (SD = 11.740) for suicidal ideation and 15.262 (SD = 6.845) for deliberate rumination. Significant correlations were observed between these variables. Mediation analyses indicated that stigma directly influenced suicidal ideation and indirectly affected it through deliberate rumination, which mediated 92% of the total effect. These findings suggest that deliberate rumination acts as a cognitive recalibration mechanism disrupting the stigma–suicidality pathway, consistent with Cognitive Behavioural Theory's focus on restructuring maladaptive schemas. In clinical practice, integrating deliberate rumination training (e.g., through Socratic questioning) into suicide prevention protocols, combined with digital monitoring tools (e.g., wearable sensors or NLP) to assess stigma-related negative thoughts, language and behaviours, could enable early detection of high-risk individuals. This combined intervention may effectively mitigate stigma-induced suicidal ideation.",10.1111/inm.70065,0,Scopus,105006685346,2-s2.0-105006685346,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006685346
"Exploring perceptions of health literacy, healthcare access, and utilisation among higher education students in Alentejo, Southern Portugal: A qualitative study",Rosário J.,2025,Plos One,"Introduction Health Literacy (HL), defined as the ability to access, understand, appraise and apply health information to make informed decisions, is essential for individual and public health. However, in rural regions such as Alentejo, Portugal, higher education students often encounter specific challenges that hinder the development and effective use of these skills. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of higher education students in Alentejo, Portugal, with regard to health literacy, access to and utilisation of healthcare, and to identify barriers, facilitators and interventions to inform strategies that promote equity, build student capacity and sustainably improve health outcomes. Methodology A qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive study was conducted using three focus groups held on 11<sup>th</sup>, 13<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> December 2023, with a purposive non-probability sample of 29 participants across first-year, intermediate, and final-year levels. The participants shared their experiences, challenges, and resources related to health literacy, healthcare access, and utilisation. The focus group discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed through a systematic process of open, axial, and selective coding. Codes were organised into categories, and thematic identification was facilitated using a constant comparative method. Content analysis was conducted with MAXQDA® 22 software. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the University of Évora, Portugal, and informed consent was secured from all participants. Results The students’ perception was that health literacy, access to and utilisation of healthcare are influenced by a dynamic interaction of barriers and facilitators. The identified barriers encompassed the presence of misinformation, financial and logistical challenges, and emotional stigma, particularly in the context of mental and sexual health. Conversely, facilitators were identified as encompassing access to digital tools, a family and peer support network, professional guidance and institutional resources such as libraries and workshops. The students recommended that interventions to improve health literacy be integrated into the higher education curriculum, that navigation support systems be improved and that structural inequalities be explored in order to improve access to and participation in healthcare. Conclusion Digital resources have the potential to improve access to health information; however, persistent challenges such as misinformation, financial constraints and stigma limit their impact. This study underscores the significance of specific interventions to enhance health literacy and healthcare navigation skills. These interventions include the integration of health literacy into academic curricula, the provision of specialised workshops, and the facilitation of access to healthcare services. The study identifies nursing interventions and institutional support as key strategies to promote equitable access to healthcare and improve student wellbeing.",10.1371/journal.pone.0326575,0,Scopus,105009076585,2-s2.0-105009076585,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009076585
"Digital technologies for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of diabetes distress: A review of current evidence",Sorrell S.,2025,Health Sciences Review,"Diabetes distress is defined as the emotional response to living with diabetes and the burden of intensive self-management. Despite the high prevalence of diabetes distress globally and across different populations, diabetes distress remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in both primary care and specialty settings. However, diabetes distress is highly responsive to clinical attention. Emerging evidence suggests that digital interventions such as mobile phone applications, comprehensive telehealth interventions, and artificial intelligence can provide accessible, personalized, and effective support for individuals experiencing diabetes distress. The purpose of this review is to present the latest evidence on assessing, diagnosing, and treating diabetes distress, with an emphasis on the role of digital technologies. By leveraging digital interventions and prioritizing routine screening, healthcare systems can enhance support for individuals with diabetes, ultimately improving both psychological well-being and clinical outcomes. Mobile phone applications are the most preferred digital intervention, in both older adult populations as well as adolescents and young adults, offering an effective tool for both assessing and treating diabetes distress. TunedIn, a mobile phone application grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy, reduced diabetes distress by approximately 50 % while improving HbA1c, emphasizing the theoretical foundation of diabetes distress as an emotional response to living with diabetes. Comprehensive telehealth solutions have also been shown to be feasible, reducing diabetes distress and improving glycemic outcomes at a reasonable cost without utilizing additional staffing resources. Overall, digital health solutions present a scalable and effective approach to mitigating diabetes distress. However, successful integration into clinical practice requires addressing implementation barriers, improving accessibility, and ensuring culturally tailored interventions. Future research should refine these technologies and explore long-term impacts, with the goal of enhancing both psychological well-being and diabetes management outcomes.",10.1016/j.hsr.2025.100227,2,Scopus,105018878970,2-s2.0-105018878970,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018878970
Applying user-centred techniques and expert feedback to refine an AI-based app for addressing mobile gaming addiction in adolescents,Khoziasheva A.,2025,Dialogues in Health,"Background: The prevalent use of smartphones has contributed to a rise in mobile gaming addiction, especially in young people. This study aimed to describe the design of an enhanced version of the AI-based mGaming Wellness mobile app, to support young individuals in developing healthy mobile gaming habits. Methods: The study utilised a 4-phased methodology, based on user-centred design principles, the Mobile App Rating Scale, a focus group and in-depth interviews with the app's target audience, and a think-aloud method. Results: The first round of refinement of mGaming Wellness, guided by input from an expert panel, focused on enhancing engagement and information quality. Feedback led to the identification of 5 key components for digital interventions, including mood and sleep trackers, a statistics dashboard, and educational modules tailored to young users' needs.

The need for research on AI-driven social media and adolescent mental health,Fadillah D.,2025,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in social media platforms has transformed digital interactions, particularly among adolescents. AI-driven algorithms curate highly personalized content, reinforcing behavioral patterns and optimizing engagement. While this enhances user experience, it also raises significant concerns regarding adolescent mental health, including increased anxiety, depression, self-esteem issues, and body dissatisfaction. Despite the growing recognition of social media's psychological effects, there remains a critical gap in research specifically addressing [how algorithmic mechanisms such as content recommendation systems, engagement prediction tools, and real-time behavior analysis] shape adolescent mental health. This letter advocates for greater scholarly attention to the intersection of AI and adolescent mental health, urging the Asian Journal of Psychiatry to prioritize studies that examine the psychological consequences of AI-curated digital environments. A deeper understanding of this issue is essential for informing clinical interventions, shaping ethical AI policies, and fostering digital literacy initiatives that promote adolescent well-being.",10.1016/j.ajp.2025.104513,3,Scopus,105003975442,2-s2.0-105003975442,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003975442

Predictors of smartphone addiction in adolescents with depression: combing the machine learning and moderated mediation model approach,Zhou Y.,2025,Behaviour Research and Therapy,"Smartphone addiction (SA) significantly impacts the physical and mental health of adolescents, and can further exacerbate existing mental health issues in those with depression. However, fewer studies have focused on the predictors of SA in adolescents with depression. This study employs machine learning methods to identify key risk factors for SA, using the interpretable SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to enhance interpretability. Additionally, by constructing a mediation moderation model, the interactions between significant risk factors are analyzed. The study included 2203 adolescents with depression. Machine learning results from four models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) consistently identified emotion-focused coping, rumination, and school bullying as the strongest predictors of SA. Further mediation moderation analyses based on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model revealed that rumination significantly mediated the relationship between school bullying and SA, and emotion-focused coping significantly moderated the relationships between school bullying and both rumination and SA. This is the first study to use machine learning to explore the predictors of SA in depressive adolescents and further analyze the interactions among these predictors. Future interventions for SA in adolescents with depression may benefit from psychotherapy that addresses emotion-focused coping and rumination.",10.1016/j.brat.2025.104749,2,Scopus,105002830993,2-s2.0-105002830993,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002830993

Analysis and Prediction of College Students’ Hidden Mental Health Status Based on Data Mining,Wang L.,2025,Proceedings of 2025 International Conference on Big Data and Informatization Education Icbdie 2025,"With the rapid development of social economy and the continuous reform of education system, the pressure and competition faced by college students continue to increase, so that the mental health problems of college students are becoming increasingly serious. Among them, hidden mental problems are difficult to identify, imperceptible, sudden and serious, which has become an important challenge for mental health education in colleges and universities. However, at this stage, the selection of mental health assessment tools and the formulation of assessment process in colleges and universities are lack of scientific and normative, and lack of necessary technical support, so that the accuracy of assessment results is insufficient, and it is difficult to play the actual effect of early warning mechanism. In this regard, based on the actual needs, this paper will focus on analyzing the practical advantages and feasibility of big data analysis and data mining technology, and put forward a set of analysis and prediction scheme of hidden mental health status of college students based on data mining, in order to provide scientific basis and personalized intervention strategies for mental health education in colleges and universities.

Inferring Mood-While-Eating with Smartphone Sensing and Community-Based Model Personalization,Bangamuarachchi W.,2025,ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare,"The interplay between mood and eating episodes has been extensively researched within the fields of nutrition, psychology, and behavioral science, revealing a connection between the two. Previous studies have relied on questionnaires and mobile phone self-reports to investigate the relationship between mood and eating. In more recent work, phone sensor data has been utilized to characterize both eating behavior and mood independently, particularly in the context of mobile food diaries and mobile health applications. However, current literature exhibits several limitations: a lack of investigation into the generalization of mood inference models trained with data from various everyday life situations to specific contexts like eating; an absence of studies using sensor data to explore the intersection of mood and eating; and inadequate examination of model personalization techniques within limited label settings, a common challenge in mood inference (i.e., far fewer negative mood reports compared to positive or neutral reports). In this study, we examined the everyday eating and mood using two separate datasets from two different studies: (i) Mexico (N = 84, 1,843 mood-while-eating reports with a label distribution of positive: 51.7%, neutral: 38.6%, and negative: 9.8%) in 2019, and (ii) eight countries (N = 678, 329K mood reports, including 24K mood-while-eating reports with a label distribution of positive: 83%, neutral: 14.9%, and negative: 2.2%) in 2020, which contain both passive smartphone sensing and self-report data. Our results indicate that generic mood inference models experience a decline in performance in specific contexts, such as during eating, highlighting the issue of sub-context shifts in mobile sensing. Moreover, we discovered that population-level (non-personalized) and hybrid (partially personalized) modeling techniques fall short in the commonly used three-class mood inference task (positive, neutral, negative). Additionally, we found that user-level modeling posed challenges for the majority of participants due to insufficient labels and data in the negative class. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a novel community-based personalization approach, building models with data from a set of users similar to the target user. Our findings demonstrate that mood-while-eating can be inferred with accuracies 63.8% (with F1 score of 62.5) for the MEX dataset and 88.3% (with F1 score of 85.7) with the MUL dataset using community-based models, surpassing those achieved with traditional methods.",10.1145/3723047,0,Scopus,105010842083,2-s2.0-105010842083,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010842083
Ningbo Schizophrenia Cohort (NSC) - A longitudinal ambispective cohort based on electronic health records: Cohort profile,Ye H.,2025,BMJ Open,"Purpose Electronic health records (EHR) passively generate large datasets on real-world patient populations in easily retrievable form, allowing the cost-efficient and timely execution of epidemiological cohorts on a broad array of topics. However, EHR-based cohorts specialising in mental disorders have not yet been reported. Ningbo has made significant achievements in healthcare data management in China. This study, relying on the Ningbo Mental Health Information System and the Ningbo Regional Health Information Platform, has established the Ningbo Schizophrenia Cohort (NSC), providing an exemplary study for cohort studies on schizophrenia. Participants This population-based ambispective cohort study included patients with schizophrenia aged 18-65 years at the time of diagnosis who were eligible for healthcare services in Ningbo, China. Participants were identified using the Ningbo Mental Health Information System between 1 January 2010, and 31 December 2023. Once an individual enters the NSC, they are followed up continuously until death or relocation. A total of 26 899 patients with schizophrenia are included in the NSC. Findings to date Among 26 899 patients, 55.4% were female and 53.1% had less than 7 years of education. Until 31 December 2023, 4505 deaths occurred, and 97.83% of patients had at least one electronic medical record. The median age at diagnosis for non-survivors (median (IQR): 40 (29-51) years) was higher than that of survivors (median (IQR): 34 (26-45) years). Future plans The NSC will continue to collect longitudinal data to capture the full life cycle of schizophrenia, including pre-onset, diagnosis, follow-up, recovery or death. This will result in a continuous, complete and multidimensional EHR for patients with schizophrenia. Planned future research aims to generate new real-world evidence on the aetiology of schizophrenia, investigate comorbidities to facilitate co-management and develop predictive models for schizophrenia and related cardiovascular diseases.

Specifically, we compare the abilities of Long Short-Term Memory networks to those of Support Vector Machines and traditional Artificial Neural Networks for modeling temporal dependencies and predicting mood state. We further hypothesize that variations in data sampling rates will influence model performance and hypothesize that a combination of high data resolution and a focus on more recent movement will support peak performance. These hypotheses guide our exploration of data preparation techniques and model selection strategies for addressing technical challenges related to Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions aimed at mental health monitoring.

Predicting Diagnostic Progression to Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder via Machine Learning,Hansen L.,2025,JAMA Psychiatry,"IMPORTANCE The diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is often delayed several years despite illness typically emerging in late adolescence or early adulthood, which impedes initiation of targeted treatment. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether machine learning models trained on routine clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs) can predict diagnostic progression to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder among patients undergoing treatment in psychiatric services for other mental illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was based on data from EHRs from the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region. All patients aged 15 to 60 years with at least 2 contacts (at least 3 months apart) with the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region between January 1, 2013, and November 21, 2016, were included. Analysis occurred from December 2022 to November 2024. EXPOSURES Predictors based on EHR data, including medications, diagnoses, and clinical notes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diagnostic transition to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder within 5 years, predicted 1 day before outpatient contacts by means of elastic net regularized logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to determine the best performing model. RESULTS The study included 24 449 patients (median [Q1-Q3] age at time of prediction, 32.2 [24.2-42.5] years; 13 843 female [56.6%]) and 398 922 outpatient contacts. Transition to the first occurrence of either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder was predicted by the XGBoost model, with an AUROC of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.70-0.70) on the training set and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.63-0.65) on the test set, which consisted of 2 held-out hospital sites. At a predicted positive rate of 4%, the XGBoost model had a sensitivity of 9.3%, a specificity of 96.3%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 13.0%. Predicting schizophrenia separately yielded better performance (AUROC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.79-0.81; sensitivity, 19.4%; specificity, 96.3%; PPV, 10.8%) than was the case for bipolar disorder (AUROC, 0.62, 95% CI, 0.61-0.63; sensitivity, 9.9%; specificity, 96.2%; PPV, 8.4%). Clinical notes proved particularly informative for prediction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that it is possible to predict diagnostic transition to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder from routine clinical data extracted from EHRs, with schizophrenia being notably easier to predict than bipolar disorder.",10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2024.4702,7,Scopus,86000334141,2-s2.0-86000334141,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000334141
"Opportunities, Requirements, and Risks of a Student Mental Health Chatbot: A Qualitative User-Centered, Multi-Method Approach",Reichenpfader D.,2025,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,"Mental health challenges among university students are increasing, but stigma and limited access to professional support hinder help seeking. This study explored opportunities, requirements, and risks associated with developing a chatbot-based mental health application tailored to Swiss university students. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with student counselors, administrators, and representatives, as well as a requirements engineering workshop involving key stakeholders. The results showed that a chatbot could reduce stigma, improve accessibility and support vulnerable groups, provided it included easy access, evidence-based content and emergency responses.

Gender differences in personalized psychological interventions for college students: a narrative review integrating the Theory of Multiple Intelligences,Zeng X.,2025,Journal of Men S Health,"This narrative review explores gender differences in the design of psychological interventions for college students, using Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) as a conceptual framework. It examines how variations in mental health challenges, such as the higher prevalence of anxiety and depression among females and the greater propensity for risk-taking behaviors among males, correspond with cognitive profiles outlined in MI theory. Socialization processes further reinforce these differences, with females often exhibiting stronger linguistic and interpersonal capacities, making emotion-focused interventions—such as expressive writing and group discussions—more effective. In contrast, males, who frequently demonstrate enhanced bodily-kinesthetic and spatial abilities, may benefit more from action-oriented interventions, including physical activities or virtual reality (VR) tasks. To integrate these cognitive and psychological dimensions, this review introduces a Gender-Sensitive Psychological Integration Model, which synthesizes biological factors (e.g., neuroendocrine pathways), sociocultural influences (e.g., gender norms) and MI profiles to establish a systematic framework for personalized interventions. While universal strategies, such as mindfulness training and digital platforms, enhance accessibility, gender-specific approaches ensure that interventions align with cognitive and psychological predispositions, thereby optimizing their effectiveness. This dual-framework approach addresses both broad and individualized mental health needs. Despite its contributions, this review is limited by its focus on binary sex and gender distinctions, which may not fully capture the diversity of gender identities and psychological experiences. Future research should adopt a more inclusive perspective, incorporating non-binary and intersectional considerations to enhance the applicability of gender-sensitive psychological interventions.",10.22514/jomh.2025.063,0,Scopus,105007644806,2-s2.0-105007644806,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007644806
Exploring How AI Literacy and Self-Regulated Learning Relate to Student Writing Performance and Well-Being in Generative AI-Supported Higher Education,Shi J.,2025,Behavioral Sciences,"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into higher education is transforming students’ learning processes, academic performance, and psychological well-being. Despite the increasing adoption of GAI tools, the mechanisms through which students’ AI literacy and self-regulated learning (SRL) relate to their academic and emotional experiences remain underexplored. This study investigates how AI literacy and SRL are associated with writing performance and digital well-being among university students in GAI-supported higher learning contexts. A survey was administered to 257 students from universities in China, and structural equation modeling was used to examine the hypothesized relationships. Results show that both AI literacy and SRL significantly and positively predict students’ writing performance, with SRL having a stronger effect. Moreover, AI literacy shows a positive association with GAI-driven well-being, with writing performance serving as a partial mediator in this relationship. These findings suggest that fostering both technological competencies and effective learning strategies may support students’ academic outcomes while supporting their psychological well-being in AI-enriched educational environments. By integrating AI literacy and SRL into a unified model, this study contributes to the growing body of research on GAI-driven well-being in higher education and offers practical implications for cultivating balanced and sustainable learning experiences in the age of GAI.",10.3390/bs15050705,4,Scopus,105006676600,2-s2.0-105006676600,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006676600

Opinion Mining of Erowid’s Experience Reports on LSD and Psilocybin-Containing Mushrooms,Al-Imam A.,2025,Drug Safety,"Background: Psychedelics are gaining attention for their therapeutic potential in modern and personalized medicine. Online forums such as Erowid provide valuable user insights, but analyses of these experiences using natural language processing (NLP) remain scarce. Objective: This study aims to utilize NLP, including sentiment and lexicon analysis, to examine user-generated experience reports on psilocybin-containing mushrooms and LSD from the Erowid forum. Methods: Data from 2188 Erowid users (1161 psilocybin mushrooms and 1027 LSD) was collected via automated web scraping with XPath, CSS selectors, and Selenium WebDriver. The dataset included report titles, substances, and demographics. Sentiment analysis utilized BERT, RoBERTa, and VADER models. Preprocessing involved tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and stop-word filtering. Lexicon analysis identified themes through recurring n-grams, visualized using Python. Results: User demographics revealed comparable ages for psilocybin mushrooms (23.8 ± 0.9 years) and LSD users (20.0 ± 0.6 years), with a predominance of male users. The BERT model predominantly labeled experiences as negative (unfavorable), particularly for mushroom users (p = 0.001). VADER indicated more positive experiences for mushroom users (p < 0.001), while RoBERTa mainly classified experiences as negative or neutral. Significant gender differences were found only with VADER, where more male users expressed positive opinions about psilocybin mushrooms (74.09% versus 65.52%, p < 0.021). The VADER model yielded more polarized results, whereas RoBERTa’s cautious classifications indicate its suitability for analyzing lengthy and complex psychedelic reports. Further, RoBERTa outperformed other transformer-based models, achieving the highest accuracy. Lexicon analysis revealed emotional, sensory, and temporal themes, with psilocybin reports emphasizing introspection and time dilation phenomenon, while LSD reports highlighted memory issues and cognitive disorientation. Conclusions: Sentiment analysis showed that VADER produced more polarized results, while RoBERTa offered cautious classifications with the highest accuracy. Lexicon analysis revealed shared themes, with mushroom reports focusing on introspection and time dilation perception, while those of LSD emphasized cognitive disturbances. This study highlights the value of these analyses in understanding psychedelic experiences, informing harm reduction, and guiding policy-making.",10.1007/s40264-025-01530-z,0,Scopus,86000318726,2-s2.0-86000318726,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000318726
Developing the DigIQ: A measure of digital competence,de Vries D.A.,2025,Plos One,"Digital competence reflects the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the digital world. Despite the criticality of this concept, the field lacks a robust and valid measure of digital competence that is suitable across the life span. Addressing this need, using data from more than 2500 participants across three studies, this work presents the development of the DigIQ – a psychometrically valid indicator of digital competence for use across the lifespan. The measure reflects the complexity of digital competence – covering nine skill domains (strategic information skills, critical information skills, netiquette, digital content creation skills, safety and control of information and devices, digital health and wellbeing, sustainable/green digital skills, digital problem-solving skills, and AI skills) and related digital knowledge. While promising, results highlight important future considerations – namely, the need to assess the tool’s suitability for younger demographics and individuals with limited literacy skills; the importance of complementing this tool with more nuanced indicators when making interpretations across age groups; and the need to adapt this tool to reflect emerging technological developments. Still, even with these caveats, the DigIQ represents an important advance in digital competence assessment, and thanks to its open access approach, can widely inform evidence-based decision-making and promote digital competence in an increasingly digitized world.",10.1371/journal.pone.0322995,0,Scopus,105005002684,2-s2.0-105005002684,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005002684
Multimodal Machine Learning Prediction of 12-Month Suicide Attempts in Bipolar Disorder,Pigoni A.,2025,Bipolar Disorders,"Introduction: Bipolar disorder (BD) patients present an increased risk of suicide attempts. Most current machine learning (ML) studies predicting suicide attempts are cross-sectional, do not employ time-dependent variables, and do not assess more than one modality. Therefore, we aimed to predict 12-month suicide attempts in a sample of BD patients, using clinical and brain imaging data. Methods: A sample of 163 BD patients were recruited and followed up for 12 months. Gray matter volumes and cortical thickness were extracted from the T1-weighted images. Based on previous literature, we extracted 56 clinical and demographic features from digital health records. Support Vector Machine was used to differentiate BD subjects who attempted suicide. First, we explored single modality prediction (clinical features, GM, and thickness). Second, we implemented a multimodal stacking-based data fusion framework. Results: During the 12 months, 6.13% of patients attempted suicide. The unimodal classifier based on clinical data reached an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 and balanced accuracy (BAC) of 72.7%. The model based on GM reached an AUC of 0.86 and BAC of 76.4%. The multimodal classifier (clinical + GM) reached an AUC of 0.88 and BAC of 83.4%, significantly increasing the sensitivity. The most important features were related to suicide attempts history, medications, comorbidities, and depressive polarity. In the GM model, the most relevant features mapped in the frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions. Conclusions: By combining models, we increased the detection of suicide attempts, reaching a sensitivity of 80%. Combining more than one modality proved a valid method to overcome limitations from single-modality models and increasing overall accuracy.",10.1111/bdi.70011,3,Scopus,86000738463,2-s2.0-86000738463,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000738463
Unveiling the impact of dataset size on machine learning models for anxiety and depression prediction amid the COVID-19 pandemic: determining optimal data collection thresholds,Arora P.,2025,Current Psychology,"Our emotional, psychological, and social well-being are all parts of our mental health. An individual’s routine can be disrupted and their mental is health affected by stress, despair, and anxiety. Mental health preservation and restoration are essential for each person as well as for communities and society as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a strong emotional and psychological reaction in many people, in addition to triggering a global health emergency. The pandemic’s uncertainty, disruptions, and social changes have amplified stress, fear, and depression, which are common responses to crises. Data collection for the COVID-19-related depression and anxiety assessment was limited to online methods because of the ongoing pandemic. In the field of mental health evaluation, the application of machine learning techniques has emerged as a promising strategy for identifying and grasping anxiety and depression symptoms. This paper employed K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques on the prevalence of anxiety and depression among Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper addresses how the accuracy of predictions made by various machine learning models is affected by the size of the datasets. The findings of this study illuminate the scalability and generalizability of different machine-learning methods. The findings validate that how accuracy of the models has consistently and significantly improved as the dataset size varies. The performance of classification models is further assessed using the F1 score, precision, and recall.",10.1007/s12144-025-07432-8,2,Scopus,85217239923,2-s2.0-85217239923,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217239923
Absence of nonfatal suicidal behavior preceding suicide death reveals differences in clinical risks,Coon H.,2025,Psychiatry Research,"Nonfatal suicidal behavior is the most robust predictor of suicide death. However, only ∼10 % of those who survive an attempt go on to die by suicide. Moreover, ∼50 % of suicide deaths occur in the absence of prior known attempts, suggesting risks other than nonfatal suicide attempt need to be identified to help prevent suicide mortality. We studied data from 4,000 population-ascertained suicide deaths and 26,191 population controls to improve understanding of suicide deaths without prior nonfatal attempts. This study included 2,253 suicide deaths and 3,375 controls with evidence of nonfatal suicidal ideation or behaviors (SUI_SI/SB and CTL_SI/SB) from diagnostic codes and natural language processing of electronic health records notes. Characteristics of these groups were compared to 1,669 suicides with no prior nonfatal SI/SB (SUI_None) and 22,816 controls with no lifetime suicidality (CTL_None). The SUI_None and CTL_None groups had fewer overall diagnoses and were older than SUI_SI/SB and CTL_SI/SB. Mental health diagnoses were far less common in both the SUI_None and CTL_None groups; mental health problems were far less associated with suicide death than with presence of SI/SB. Physical health diagnoses were conversely more often associated with risk of suicide death than with presence of SI/SB. Pending replication, results indicate highly significant clinical differences among suicide deaths with versus without prior nonfatal SI/SB, and suggest that, for a substantial number of individuals at risk for suicide mortality, history of SI/SB does not serve as an effective clinical marker of risk.",10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116391,2,Scopus,85218912685,2-s2.0-85218912685,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218912685
Characterization and treatment patterns of patients treated with immediate-release sodium oxybate for narcolepsy: A propensity score–matched cohort study,Lipford M.C.,2025,Journal of Clinical Neuroscience,"Background: Sodium oxybate (SXB) is strongly recommended for narcolepsy treatment. Comorbidities and treatment patterns of patients with narcolepsy treated vs not treated with SXB are unknown. Methods: An electronic health record-based search identified first-time Mayo Clinic patients with ≥ 1 narcolepsy-specific International Classification of Diseases 9th/10th Revision code and ≥ 1 diagnostic mention of narcolepsy in clinical notes (1975–2020). Common comorbidities were compared between age/sex matched cohorts with and without SXB treatment using odds ratios. Reasons for SXB therapy not being continued or taken as directed were identified using manual chart review. Results: Of the 4387 patients with narcolepsy identified, 8 % (n = 351) received SXB treatment and 92 % (n = 4036) did not. The most common comorbidities (>20 % overall population) were insomnia, fatigue, depression, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, arrhythmia, and idiopathic hypersomnia. In the cohorts of 351 matched patients, no significant differences between cohorts were observed for any comorbidity at any time point (overall, 5 years before or after diagnosis). Among patients who received SXB, 113 had clinical notes indicating discontinuation of SXB, with a reason documented for 71 (most common: lack of efficacy [n = 11]). Of the 24 recorded reasons for patients missing the second nightly SXB dose, the most frequent was the inability to wake up, with consequences noted the next day of increased symptoms. Conclusions: No significant differences in comorbidities were observed between cohorts. Although SXB is a highly effective treatment for narcolepsy, this study highlights challenges patients face while taking twice-nightly SXB, which may result in underuse/misuse and suboptimal treatment.",10.1016/j.jocn.2025.111185,1,Scopus,105000305489,2-s2.0-105000305489,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000305489
Evaluation of a cognition-sensitive spatial virtual reality game for Alzheimer's disease,Chatterjee R.,2025,Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing,"Spatial impairment characterizes Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from its earliest stages. We present the design and preliminary evaluation of ""Barn Ruins,"" a serious virtual reality (VR) wayfinding game for early-stage AD. Barn Ruins is tailored to the cognitive abilities of this population, featuring simple controls and error-based scoring system. Ten younger adults, ten cognitively healthy older adults, and ten age-matched individuals with AD participated in this study. They underwent cognitive assessments using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before gameplay. The game involves navigating a virtual environment to find a target room, with increasing levels of difficulty. This study aimed to confirm the cognitive sensitivity of the Barn Ruins' spatial learning score by studying its relationship with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. MoCA scores and spatial learning scores had a correlation coefficient of 0.755 (p < 0.001). Logistic regression further revealed that higher spatial learning scores significantly predicted lower odds of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.495, 95% CI [0.274, 0.746], p < 0.005). The initial results suggest that the game is effective in differentiating performance among participant groups. This research demonstrates the potential of the Barn Ruins game as an innovative tool for assessing spatial navigation in AD, highlighting areas for future validation and investigation as a training tool.",10.1007/s11517-024-03270-1,3,Scopus,85213043289,2-s2.0-85213043289,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213043289
Cadê o Kauê? Co-design and acceptability testing of a chat-story aimed at enhancing youth participation in the promotion of mental health in Brazil,Pavarini G.,2025,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines,"Background: Adolescent mental health is vital for public health, yet many interventions fail to recognise adolescents as proactive community contributors. This paper discusses the co-design and acceptability testing of a chat-story intervention to enhance Brazilian adolescents' participation in the promotion of mental health in their peer communities. We specifically highlight the iterative process of co-creating this intervention with community stakeholders. Methods: The co-design was led by researchers, a youth collaborative group, and health-tech experts. Part 1 included quantitative (n = 1,768) and qualitative (n = 46) studies with Brazilian adolescents aged 15–18 for priority-setting. Part 2 involved co-creation and technical production, with input from youth advisors (n = 24), school staff (n = 11), and policy experts (n = 3). In Part 3, the chat-story was user tested (n = 32). Parts 4 and 5 assessed acceptability through a qualitative study in schools (n = 138) and initial efficacy during an online campaign (n = 795). Results: Participants aspired to support their peers' mental health in schools, both one-to-one and collectively, but felt unprepared. This informed the chat-story's goal of enhancing peer support and collective action skills. Themes identified during Part 1, such as prejudice and academic pressure, were woven into the narrative to raise awareness of the social determinants of mental health, drawing from real-life stories. In the final story, players search for their missing best friend at school, uncovering his anxiety struggles and practicing skills such as empathic listening and partnership building. A manual for teachers was collaboratively designed for use within school settings, supplementing direct-to-user online applications. Acceptability testing showed participants found the tool authentic and user-friendly. Online users perceived the tool as preparing and motivating them to offer peer support and engage in collective action. Conclusions: The immersive co-creation model, enriched by input from key stakeholders, yielded a relevant and well-received intervention for Brazilian adolescents. Co-designed creative tools like chat-stories hold promise as digital mental health tools, fostering awareness, critical reflection, and inspiring adolescents to drive positive social change.",10.1111/jcpp.14078,1,Scopus,105003725649,2-s2.0-105003725649,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003725649

A Study on Breast Cancer Patient Care Using Chatbot and Video Education for Radiation Therapy: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Lee J.,2025,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the use of chatbot and video education to reduce anxiety in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT). Methods and Materials: This randomized controlled trial included patients with breast cancer scheduled for RT after surgery at an outpatient department of radiation oncology in a cancer center, randomly assigned to 4 groups: (1) video + chatbot, (2) video + paper, (3) paper + chatbot, and (4) paper + paper. In each group, patients received information regarding the treatment process and were frequently asked questions using the designated tool. Patient anxiety was evaluated using the Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information scale (APAIS), state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), and linear analog scale assessment (LASA) at 3 points: (1) initial outpatient visit (T0), (2) before the RT course (T1), and (3) after the RT course (T2). The primary endpoint was APAIS, and the secondaries were STAI and LASA. A mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted with time as a within-group factor and treatment conditions as a between-group factor. Results: The final analysis included 145 patients. No significant interaction was observed between groups and time for the APAIS, STAI, or LASA. Although unplanned, analyses were conducted using the age of 50 years as the cutoff, based on a previous systematic review of digital literacy in the medical field. A trend toward reduced APAIS was found among patients aged ≤50 years who used the chatbot (per-protocol subgroup). In the video + chatbot group, the APAIS score decreased from 3.06 (T0) to 1.88 (T2); in contrast, in the paper + paper group, it decreased from 2.42 (T0) to 2.06 (T2). In contrast, no significant interaction was observed in the APAIS of per-protocol patients aged ≥50 years. Conclusions: Overall, no significant differences were found in the effectiveness of different types of educational media in reducing patients’ anxiety. However, for young patients who actively use video or chatbot resources, education through digital media may meaningfully reduce their anxiety during the RT process.",10.1016/j.ijrobp.2024.12.012,5,Scopus,85214666079,2-s2.0-85214666079,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214666079
Social media literacy in the age of Artificial Intelligence,Fang L.,2025,Proceedings of 2024 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education Icaie 2024,"In the age of Artificial Intelligence, college students have adapted to interact with the world in a new media ecosystem. Since the era of web 2.0, social networking site (SNS) combined attributes of interpersonal communication technology and mass media, and its arrival made ""many to many""interaction mode easily available. Young people especially rely on social media to socialize, entertain, seek information, and present themselves. Scholars and educators have paid more and more attention to the youth digital literacy as well as their new media literacy. How college students' social media involvement influences their psychological well-being has been researchers' concerns. To better understand current situation of college students' social media literacy, this empirical research conducted a survey on college students' social media use behavior and stress coping preferences. A total of 431 undergraduate students participated in an online survey in 2023. Three mediators between student participants' individualized social media involvement and their adaptive stress coping are tested by AMOS. A few social network attributes are tested as moderators through multiple linear regression by SPSS. Findings suggest that college students' social media involvement assist their psychological well-being in some way. Sample students' frequency of participating in social media groups is positively related of adaptive stress coping. Their perceived social support from SNS is a key mediator between individualized SNS involvement and adaptive stress coping. However, sample students' online role modeling behavior is negatively associated with their adaptive stress coping.

Health-Promoting Effects and Everyday Experiences With a Mental Health App Using Ecological Momentary Assessments and AI-Based Ecological Momentary Interventions Among Young People: Qualitative Interview and Focus Group Study,Hiller S.,2025,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"BACKGROUND: Considering the high prevalence of mental health conditions among young people and the technological advancements of artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches in health services, mobile health (mHealth) apps for mental health are a promising way for low-threshold and large-scale mental health promotion, prevention, and intervention strategies, especially for young people. However, insufficient evidence on health-promoting effects and deficient user-centric designs emphasize the necessity for participatory methods in the interventions' development processes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore young people's everyday experiences using an AI-based mHealth app for mental health promotion based on ecological momentary assessments and ecological momentary interventions. Our analysis of qualitative data focused on exploring young people's use patterns in daily life and mental health-promoting effects. METHODS: We conducted problem-centered interviews and focus groups with a subsample of 27 young people aged 14 to 25 years, who were among the participants of 2 microrandomized trials testing and evaluating an AI-based mHealth app (AI4U training). Our study used a participatory approach, with ""co- and peer researchers"" from the dialogue population actively engaged in research processes and data analysis. Structural content analysis guided the qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported enhanced emotional self-awareness and regulation in daily life through the ecological momentary assessments and ecological momentary interventions. Young people appreciated the AI4U training for managing emotions and stress. They had no trust issues regarding disclosing their mental health via the AI4U training in daily life. Some faced challenges integrating it into their daily routines and highlighted the value of autonomy in use decision-making processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that young people benefited from enhanced emotional awareness and management through the use of the AI4U training, appreciating its anonymity for facilitating emotional disclosure. The results suggest that enhanced self-directed use may improve daily life integration, although participants noted that they sometimes avoided using the AI4U training during distress despite recognizing its potential benefits. These findings indicate the importance of balancing directed use and autonomy in digital interventions to harmonize compliance with effectiveness in daily life. We highlight the importance of participatory research for tailored digital mental health solutions.",10.2196/65106,3,Scopus,105004335701,2-s2.0-105004335701,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004335701
Exploring Socio-Cultural Challenges and Opportunities in Designing Mental Health Chatbots for Adolescents in India,Sehgal N.K.R.,2025,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Proceedings,"Mental health challenges among Indian adolescents are shaped by unique cultural and systemic barriers, including high social stigma and limited professional support. Through a mixed-methods study involving a survey of 278 adolescents and follow-up interviews with 12 participants, we explore how adolescents perceive mental health challenges and interact with digital tools. Quantitative results highlight low self-stigma but significant social stigma, a preference for text over voice interactions, and low utilization of mental health apps but high smartphone access. Our qualitative findings reveal that while adolescents value privacy, emotional support, and localized content in mental health tools, existing chatbots lack personalization and cultural relevance. These findings inform recommendations for culturally sensitive chatbot design that prioritizes anonymity, tailored support, and localized resources to better meet the needs of adolescents in India.

#TheHealthYouthWant: a qualitative analysis of a global crowdsourcing open call for innovative ideas to promote adolescent health and well-being in countries with a high HIV burden,Hlatshwako T.G.,2025,Sexual Health,"Background: Improving adolescent health and well-being is a key policy priority in countries with a high HIV burden, because adolescents have lower rates of treatment coverage, viral load suppression and survival compared with others. This study aimed to identify innovative ideas from young people (aged 10-30 years) on how adolescent health and well-being can be improved in communities most affected by HIV. Methods: We organized a global crowdsourcing open call for ideas from young people on how to improve adolescent HIV outcomes and well-being in countries with a high HIV burden. At least three independent judges assessed each submission based on prespecified criteria. We then conducted a thematic analysis of eligible submissions to identify key themes to inform HIV programming and policy. Results: We received 357 submissions from 37 countries. Of 107 eligible submissions, 91 (85%) described new ideas. Seventy-one (66%) participants were aged 20-30 years, and 30 (28%) were aged 10-19 years. Major themes suggested that edutainment interventions linking entertainment and education could increase adolescent uptake of HIV services. Digital interventions adapted for analog cellphone users (e.g. unstructured supplemental service delivery) could increase the reach of HIV information and engage remote, rural participants. Peer-based interventions could improve feelings of social inclusion among adolescents.

Digital technology-assisted debridement and bone and soft tissue reconstruction for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia,He H.,2025,Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics,"Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of digital technology-assisted debridement and bone and soft tissue reconstruction in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia. Methods This retrospective study analyzed clinical data from 38 patients (26 males, 12 females; mean age 45.61±18.36 years, range 16-83 years) with chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis complicated by soft tissue defects in the tibia, treated at the Department of Orthopaedics, Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital between June 2021 and June 2023. There were 18 cases of traffic accidents, 6 cases of high-altitude falls, 6 cases of heavy objects and 6 cases of low-energy falls. Lesion sites: 12 cases in the upper segment of the tibia, 12 cases in the middle segment, and 14 cases in the lower segment. According to the Cierny-Mader classification, there were 24 cases of type III and 14 cases of type IV. Before the operation, the ""3D point cloud technology"" was used to plan the debridement range of bone and soft tissue. During the operation, the optical navigation system was used to monitor the debridement range in real time. The flap was designed by combining ""Reading Tablet Treasure"" with CT angiography, and the amount of bone graft was predicted by AI algorithm. The surgical method adopted is the Masquelet technique, namely thorough debridement, bone cement occupation and soft tissue repair in the first stage, and bone reconstruction in the second stage. Comparing the calculated bone defect amount and soft tissue defect area before the operation with the actual measured values after debridement. The cure rate of infection was evaluated by using the McKee bone infection treatment criteria after the operation. The visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) were used to evaluate the improvement of the quality of life of postoperative patients. Results 38 patients were followed up with a mean follow-up of 13.53±2.37 months. 37 patients' infections were effectively controlled, and 1 patient had a recurrence of infection, with an effectiveness rate of 97% for the treatment of McKee's infections. The preoperative calculated bone defect amount and soft tissue defect area were 51.05±26.31 cm<sup>3</sup> and 68.42±43.45 cm<sup>2</sup> respectively, and the actual measured values after debridement during the operation were 51.66±26.35 cm<sup>3</sup> and 68.82±43.76 cm<sup>2</sup> respectively. There was no statistically significant difference before and after the operation (P>0.05). The interval between the first and second stage surgeries was 10.36±1.61 weeks, and all flaps survived after the first stage surgery. Two months after the operation, one case had recurrent osteomyelitis. After palliative treatment, sinus tracts were formed at the infection site. At the 12-month regular dressing change follow-up, there were still purulent secretions in the sinus tracts. There was no recurrence of infection after primary debridement in 37 cases, and the bone grafts healed. The bone healing time was 3.58±0.97 months. The postoperative VAS, LEFS, and SAS scores were 1.00±0.91, 66.68±7.91, and 34.30±4.29, respectively, which were significantly improved compared with the preoperative scores of 7.54±1.52, 21.22±4.29, and 52.70±6.74, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions The application of digital technology to precisely design the debridement range of bone and soft tissue, and the real-time holographic visualization monitoring of the debridement range during the operation can achieve precise debridement of bone and soft tissue and personalized and precise repair of soft tissue defects. It is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia.",10.3760/cma.j.cn121113-20240920-00521,0,Scopus,105005745209,2-s2.0-105005745209,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005745209
"Large-scale digital phenotyping: Identifying depression and anxiety indicators in a general UK population with over 10,000 participants",Zhang Y.,2025,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Digital phenotyping offers a novel and cost-efficient approach for managing depression and anxiety. Previous studies, often limited to small-to-medium or specific populations, may lack generalizability. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 10,129 participants recruited from a UK-based general population between June 2020 and August 2022. Participants shared wearable (Fitbit) data and self-reported questionnaires on depression, anxiety, and mood via a study app. We examined correlations between mental health scores and wearable-derived features, demographics, health variables, and mood assessments. Unsupervised clustering was used to identify behavioural patterns associated with depression and anxiety. Furthermore, we employed XGBoost machine learning models to predict depression and anxiety severity and compared the performance using different subsets of features. Results: We observed significant associations between the severity of depression and anxiety with several factors, including mood, age, gender, BMI, sleep patterns, physical activity, and heart rate. Clustering analysis revealed that participants simultaneously exhibiting lower physical activity levels and higher heart rates reported more severe symptoms. Prediction models incorporating all types of variables achieved the best performance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.41, MAE = 3.42 for depression; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.31, MAE = 3.50 for anxiety) compared to those using subsets of variables. Several wearable-derived features were observed to have non-linear relationships with depression and anxiety in the prediction models. Limitations: Data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic may introduce biases. Conclusion: This study identified several indicators for depression and anxiety and highlighted the potential of digital phenotyping and machine learning technologies for rapid screening of mental disorders in general populations.",10.1016/j.jad.2025.01.124,5,Scopus,85216446966,2-s2.0-85216446966,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216446966
Fingerprint patterns of human brain activity reveal a dynamic mix of emotional responses during virtual intergroup encounters,Mendoza-Franco G.,2025,Neuroimage,"The Stereotype Content Model (SCM) states that different social groups elicit different emotions according to their perceived level of competence and warmth. Because of this relationship between stereotypes and emotional states and because emotions are highly predictive of intergroup behaviors, emotional evaluation is crucial for research on intergroup relations. However, emotional assessment heavily relies on self-reports, which are often compromised by social desirability and challenges in reporting immediate emotional appraisals. In this study, we used machine learning to identify emotional brain patterns using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subsequently, those patterns were used to monitor emotional reactions during virtual intergroup encounters. Specifically, we showed Finnish majority group members 360-videos depicting members of their ethnic ingroup and immigrant outgroups approaching and entering participants’ personal space. All the groups showed different levels of perceived competence and warmth. In alignment with the SCM, our results showed that the groups perceived as low in competence and warmth evoked contempt and discomfort. Moreover, the ambivalent low-competent/high-warm group elicited both happiness and discomfort. Additionally, upon the protagonists’ approach into personal space, emotional reactions were modulated differently for each group. Taken together, our findings suggest that our method could be used to explore the temporal dynamics of emotional responses during intergroup encounters.",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2025.121129,0,Scopus,86000298853,2-s2.0-86000298853,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000298853
Promoting university students' situational engagement in online learning for climate education,Vilhunen E.,2025,Internet and Higher Education,"Disengagement in online learning is known to pose a risk to student learning and wellbeing. In this paper, we first introduce the development and implementation process of a set of online university climate education courses aimed at enhancing student situational engagement through diverse learning activities. Second, engagement (conceptualized here as the co-occurrence of interest, skill, and challenge, i.e., optimal learning moments), and activities during the online courses were examined through ecological momentary assessment, and the relationship between them was investigated through two-level regression models. The results showed that the students were likely to experience optimal learning moments when they were formulating problems and ideating alternatives or designing solutions. Formulating problems and ideating alternatives can promote a student sense of competence, and by designing solutions, students can work with adequately challenging learning tasks. Thus, by implementing such activities in (online) teaching and learning, educators can contribute positively to student engagement.",10.1016/j.iheduc.2024.100987,3,Scopus,85209539945,2-s2.0-85209539945,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209539945
Artificial intelligence-based drug repurposing with electronic health record clinical corroboration: A case for ketamine as a potential treatment for amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder,Gao Z.,2025,Addiction,"Background and aims: Amphetamine-type stimulants are the second-most used illicit drugs globally, yet there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for amphetamine-type stimulant use disorders (ATSUD). The aim of this study was to utilize a drug discovery framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug prediction, clinical corroboration and mechanism of action analysis to identify FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for treating ATSUD. Design and setting: An AI-based knowledge graph model was first utilized to prioritize FDA-approved drugs in their potential efficacy for treating ATSUD. Among the top 10 ranked candidate drugs, ketamine represented a novel candidate with few studies examining its effects on ATSUD. We therefore conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the association between ketamine and ATSUD remission using US electronic health record (EHR) data. Finally, we analyzed the potential mechanisms of action of ketamine in the context of ATSUD. Participants and Measurements: ATSUD patients who received anesthesia (n = 3663) or were diagnosed with depression (n = 4328) between January 2019 and June 2022. The outcome measure was the diagnosis of ATSUD remission within one year of the drug prescription. Findings: Ketamine for anesthesia in ATSUD patients was associated with greater ATSUD remission compared with other anesthetics: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15–2.17. Similar results were found for ATSUD patients with depression when comparing ketamine with antidepressants and bupropion/mirtazapine with HRs of 1.51 (95% CI = 1.14–2.01) and 1.68 (95% CI = 1.18–2.38), respectively. Functional analyses demonstrated that ketamine targets several ATSUD-associated pathways including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and amphetamine addiction. Conclusions: There appears to be an association between clinician-prescribed ketamine and higher remission rates in patients with amphetamine-type stimulant use disorders.",10.1111/add.16715,1,Scopus,86000437930,2-s2.0-86000437930,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000437930
Social media interaction and built environment effects on urban walking experience: A machine learning analysis of Shanghai Citywalk,Chen X.,2025,Plos One,"In fast-paced urban environments, Citywalk has emerged as a key leisure activity for urban residents to alleviate stress and enhance emotional well-being. From the perspective of virtual-physical interaction, this study integrates social media data with geospatial information, utilizing machine learning methods and spatial statistical analysis to explore the multidimensional driving mechanisms and complex relationships affecting the emotional experiences of Citywalk participants. The findings indicate that the interaction index, as a core indicator of virtual social behavior, plays a key role in influencing emotional scores (SHAP value = 4.9104), exhibiting progressive effects without evident threshold characteristics. POI density demonstrates significant nonlinear threshold effects, with marginal benefits substantially increasing when density reaches 44.06. Additionally, spatial autocorrelation analysis of emotional scores reveals spatial clustering patterns, underscoring the critical role of interactions between virtual social behavior and physical spatial elements in emotional generation. In comparison, functional diversity and transit accessibility exhibit weaker but complementary effects on emotional scores. This research quantifies the roles of digital social behavior and the built environment in shaping emotional experiences from a virtual-physical interaction perspective, uncovering how virtual social behavior integrates into social space production through individual perception and social interaction. It extends theoretical frameworks in social space production and emotional geography. The findings provide data-driven insights for optimizing urban walking space design, proposing interaction index-oriented strategies to promote synergy between virtual and physical spaces, thus facilitating the creation of high-quality, emotionally friendly urban environments.",10.1371/journal.pone.0320951,1,Scopus,105004205697,2-s2.0-105004205697,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004205697
Using Machine Learning to Predict Uptake to an Online Self-Guided Intervention for Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic,Rackoff G.N.,2025,Stress and Health,"Online self-guided interventions appear efficacious for alleviating some mental health concerns. However, among persons who are offered online interventions, only a fraction access them (i.e., achieve uptake). Machine learning methods may be useful to predict who will achieve uptake, which could inform improvements to interventions and their methods of delivery. We used secondary data from participants given access to a self-guided online stress intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic in a randomised trial (N = 301, among whom 158 achieved uptake). This study built and evaluated several models for predicting uptake. Putative predictors included demographic characteristics, mental health service utilization and interest, and mental health symptoms assessed before participants were provided access to the intervention. The best-performing model, a linear support vector machine model, had 70% accuracy and 0.70 area under the receiver operating characteristics curve in a held-out dataset, though these metrics were not significantly better than competitor models. Model inspection revealed that participants who reported interest in mental health treatment and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority participants were more likely to achieve uptake. Additionally, male participants were less likely to achieve uptake. The best-performing machine learning model achieved an acceptable level of performance in predicting uptake. Self-reported treatment interest was especially predictive of uptake. Future research should attempt to understand gender and sexual orientation differences in self-guided online mental health intervention uptake. Additionally, research should evaluate the utility of machine learning to inform targeted motivational enhancement of those less likely to achieve uptake.",10.1002/smi.70032,0,Scopus,105003707585,2-s2.0-105003707585,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003707585
Who is your ideal peer mentor? A qualitative study to identify cancer patient preferences for a digital peer support app,Knaapen L.,2025,Supportive Care in Cancer,"Purpose: Peer support can provide many benefits to cancer patients. However, sustained use of one-on-one peer support requires a good match between patient and peer mentor. Using an artificial intelligence (AI) matching algorithm has the potential to improve peer matching by achieving complex, preference-based matching. Therefore, using stakeholder co-design, this study identified patient preferences for peer matching criteria and other features of OpalBuddy, a digital peer support service to be developed within the Opal patient portal. Methods: Patients using the Opal app were recruited, and semi-structured individual interviews were carried out with eight available women cancer patients. Qualitative data analysis followed an iterative and collaborative thematic analysis approach, using computer-assisted software (NVivo). Results: Three themes, with supporting sub-themes, that describe patient preferences for matching with an ideal peer mentor were identified: Theme 1. An ideal mentor can provide support at multiple levels, with sub-themes describing the levels: (A) Sharing illness experiences, (B) Practical information support, (C) Emotional support, (D) Social management coaching. Theme 2. The ideal mentor has similar lived experience, with sub-themes describing the type of lived experience: (A) Similar clinical situation, (B) Similar socio-demographics, (C) Interpersonal affinity. Theme 3. The ideal peer mentor will be supported in their role, with sub-themes describing support options: (A) Formal or informal training, (B) General guidance, (C) Supportive supervision. Finally, based on different support needs (practical vs emotional), it was found that patients had varying, even opposing, expectations from a mentor’s interpersonal communication style (solution focused vs good listener). Conclusion: Patient preferences for an ideal peer mentor were identified through semi-structured interviews with a sample of eight women with a diverse set of cancers. Findings will be used to guide further work, including a similar study with men and a pilot study of a digital patient matching service for peer support in the open-source Opal patient portal.",10.1007/s00520-025-09262-7,0,Scopus,86000049536,2-s2.0-86000049536,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000049536
Utilizing natural language processing for precision prevention of mental health disorders among youth: A systematic review,Ibrahim S.T.,2025,Computers in Biology and Medicine,"Background: The global mental health crisis has created barriers to youth mental healthcare, leaving many disorders unaddressed. Precision prevention, which identifies individual risks, offers the potential for tailored interventions. While natural language processing (NLP) has shown promise in the early detection of mental health disorders, no review has examined its role in youth mental health detection. We hypothesize that NLP can improve early detection and personalized care in mental healthcare among youth. Methodology: After screening 1197 articles from 5 databases, 12 papers were included covering six categories: (1) mental health disorders, (2) data sources, (3) NLP objective for mental health detection, (4) annotation and validation techniques, (5) linguistic markers, and (6) performance and evaluation. Study quality was assessed using Hawker's checklist for disparate study designs. Results: Most studies focused on suicide risk (42 %), depression (25 %), and stress (17 %). Social media (42 %) and interviews (33 %) were the most common data sources, with linguistic inquiry and word count and support vector machines frequently used for analysis. While most studies were exploratory, one implemented a real-time tool for detecting mental health risks. Validation methods, including precision and recall metrics, showed strong predictive performance. Conclusions: This review highlights the potential of NLP in youth mental health detection, addressing challenges such as bias, data quality, and ethical concerns. Future research should refine NLP models using diverse, multimodal datasets, addressing data imbalance, and improving real-time detection. Exploring transformer-based models and ensuring ethical, inclusive data handling will be key to advancing NLP-driven interventions.",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2025.109859,3,Scopus,85218265309,2-s2.0-85218265309,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218265309

LLM-Based Response Generation for Korean Adolescents: A Study Using the NAVER Knowledge iN Q&A Dataset with RAG,Kim J.,2025,Healthcare Informatics Research,"Objectives: This research aimed to develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based large language model (LLM) system that offers personalized and reliable responses to a wide range of concerns raised by Korean adolescents. Our work focuses on building a culturally reflective dataset and on designing and validating the system’s effectiveness by comparing the answer quality of RAG-based models with non-RAG models. Methods: Data were collected from the NAVER Knowledge iN platform, concentrating on posts that featured adolescents’ questions and corresponding expert responses during the pe-riod 2014–2024. The dataset comprises 3,874 cases, categorized by key negative emotions and the primary sources of worry. The data were processed to remove irrelevant or redundant content and then classified into general and detailed causes. The RAG-based model employed FAISS for similarity-based retrieval of the top three reference cases and used GPT-4o mini for response generation. The responses generated with and without RAG were evaluated using several metrics. Results: RAG-based responses outperformed non-RAG responses across all evaluation metrics. Key findings indicate that RAG-based responses delivered more specific, empathetic, and actionable guidance, particularly when addressing complex emotional and situational concerns. The analysis revealed that family relationships, peer interactions, and academic stress are significant factors affecting adolescents’ worries, with depression and stress frequently co-occurring. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of RAG-based LLMs to address the diverse and culture-specific worries of Korean adolescents. By integrating external knowledge and offering personalized support, the proposed system provides a scalable approach to enhancing mental health interventions for adolescents.

Features related to the presence of internet gaming disorder and their impact on the treatment outcomes,Ayala-Rojas R.E.,2025,Journal of Behavioral Addictions,"Background and aims: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a highly engrossing activity with the individual spending up to 10 h per day gaming, this causes issues in accomplishing their tasks and personal goals. Also, to generate in them increased anxiety, impulsivity and lack of social skills, this impacts the good personal development and individual’s quality of life. Therefore, it is vital to better understand, in terms of treatment, which factors are associated with therapeutic outcomes (largely to achieve control over the use of video games and the lack of relapses) following a standardized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol. This study aimed to explore sociodemographic and personality variables and their relation to treatment outcome in patients with IGD. Method: The sample included n 5 105 patients with IGD, considered between January 2005 and December 2022 and recruited from the Behavioral Addictions Unit at the University Hospital of Bellvitge. Data at baseline was registered (sociodemographic and clinical measures), as well as the therapy outcomes (compliance with the guidelines, presence of relapses and dropouts). Results: Patients were mainly males (n 5 95) with a mean age of 24.97 (SD 5 12.03). All patients included in this sample had individual CBT treatment in relation to their problematic gaming behavior. In terms of patients who relapsed, they had higher interpersonal sensitivity, hostility and persistence with lower self-directedness. Patients who dropped out were males with an older age of IGD onset. When looking at treatment noncompliance, it was related to higher psychoticism and reward dependence, and lower cooperation. Patients with IGD show higher levels of treatment noncompliance. Conclusion: These findings evidence a positive and promising effect of CBT on IGT. The factors identified as predictors of good and poor treatment outcomes should be considered for developing new evidence-based interventions focused on learning healthier key coping strategies to manage both cravings and triggers.",10.1556/2006.2024.00070,1,Scopus,85214799564,2-s2.0-85214799564,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214799564

"The Ancient Elephant in the Room: Stigma, Gender Norms, and Cultural Barriers in Reproductive Care in Bangladesh",Mahzabin Chowdhury H.,2025,Ictd 2024 Proceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development,"This paper examines the current state of reproductive care in Bangladesh. In this ten-month-long ethnographic research in three rural Bangladeshi villages, we explored how the sociocultural landscape, cultural beliefs, and healthcare infrastructure impact rural Bangladeshi women's access to quality reproductive healthcare services. Through observations, interviews, focus group discussions, we explored rural people's perception of different existing challenges, including high maternal mortality rates, unmet family planning needs, lack of adolescent sexual and reproductive health education, women's limited access to safe pregnancy experience and termination services, and stakeholder's roles. Additionally, we asked them about emerging opportunities like advancements in ICT and intelligent interventions and policy changes promoting reproductive rights. We found that the concept of reproductive care is strictly gender-normed in Bangladeshi rural communities. Additionally, different types of stigma and privacy issues influence people to shy away from talking about their problems with practitioners and knowledgeable community members. Thus, these stigmas and gender norms have been sustained in communities for generations, blocking people from seeking proper care and creating roadblocks for many existing tools and techniques to be adequately helpful to the community.

A CI of 0.03 and an alpha of 0.95 were used in the SPSS analysis, respectively. Result: The experimental study is backed by a modern tool compiler, and the accuracy gains of the two classifiers are linked. A small percentage of randomly selected players exhibited symptoms of mental stress and game addiction, according to the dataset's analysis of gaming behavior. With a precision of 97.37%, the ResNet-50 classifier was chosen to properly identify human activities, while the Artificial Neural Network classifier achieved a precision of 96.44%.Based on the results of the 2-tailed tests, it can be concluded that there is no statistically significant difference between the RNN algorithm and the ANN algorithm (p>0.05). Findings: Process mining techniques were the primary focus of this study's exploration of video game addiction.",10.1063/5.0258797,0,Scopus,105000694968,2-s2.0-105000694968,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000694968
Risk factor analysis and predictive model development for problematic internet gaming disorder occurrence,Kusumadewi A.F.,2025,Medicinski Glasnik,"Aim To examine several aspects, such as sociodemographic, psychological, personality, and parenting characteristics, that may contribute to the occurrence of problematic internet gaming disorder (PIGD) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Additionally, the study intends to create a model that can accurately predict people who are at high risk of developing PIGD. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 350 participants aged 15-25 years in Yogyakarta. The data were gathered through the use of a questionnaire that consisted of demographic measures: the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Big Five Inventory (BFI), and the Parenting Style Questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression was utilized for data analysis in order to identify relevant risk factors and construct a risk prediction model. Results The study revealed that certain sociodemographic characteristics (male and student), psychological factors (depression, anxiety, and stress), personality traits (high neuroticism, low conscientiousness), and authoritarian parenting style were all significant predictors of the occurrence of PIGD. These characteristics led to the creation of the risk prediction model, which demonstrated strong performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (95% CI 0.80-0.90). Conclusion Multifaceted issue and variety of risk factors influence PIGD. This study's risk prediction model can effectively identify individuals at a heightened risk of developing PIGD. This allows for early and targeted preventative and treatment interventions to be implemented.",10.17392/1844-22-01,0,Scopus,105007628244,2-s2.0-105007628244,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007628244
Unmasking Nuances Affecting Loneliness: Using Digital Behavioural Markers to Understand Social and Emotional Loneliness in College Students,Qirtas M.M.,2025,Sensors,"Loneliness is a global issue which is particularly prevalent among college students, where it poses risks to mental health and academic success. Chronic loneliness can manifest in two primary forms: social loneliness, which is defined by a lack of belonging or a social network, and emotional loneliness, which comes from the absence of deep, meaningful connections. Differentiating between these forms is crucial for designing personalized and targeted interventions. Passive sensing technology offers a promising, unobtrusive approach to detecting loneliness by using behavioural data collected from smartphones and wearables. This study investigates behavioural patterns associated with social and emotional loneliness using passively sensed data from a student population. Our objectives were to (1) identify behavioural patterns linked to social and emotional loneliness, (2) evaluate the predictive power of these patterns for classifying loneliness types, and (3) determine the most significant digital markers used by machine learning models in loneliness prediction. Using statistical analysis, machine learning, and SHAP-based feature importance methods, we identified significant differences in behaviours between socially and Emotionally Lonely students. Specifically, there were distinct differences in phone use and location-based features. Our machine learning analysis shows a strong ability to classify types of loneliness accurately. The XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy (78.48%) in predicting loneliness. Feature importance analysis found the critical role of phone usage and location-based features in distinguishing between social and emotional loneliness.",10.3390/s25061903,0,Scopus,105000940498,2-s2.0-105000940498,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000940498
The impact and application of artificial intelligence technology on mental health counseling services for college students,Gao Y.,2025,Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering,"With the intensification of social pressure and the enhancement of mental health awareness, the mental health issues of college students have become increasingly prominent, attracting social attention. Mental health counseling services, as an important way to alleviate students’ psychological stress, are facing the dual challenges of a shortage of professionals and growing service demands. In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the field of mental health has gradually risen, and its advantages in data analysis, pattern recognition, and natural language processing provide new solutions for mental health counseling services. However, existing research still faces problems such as insufficient understanding and limited emotional interaction capabilities in practical applications. This paper delves into the application of AI technology in mental health counseling services for college students and innovates and improves upon the deficiencies in existing research. The study focuses on two main areas: First, word vector generation technologies based on statistics and language models are used according to different application scenarios, and their effectiveness in the analysis of mental health counseling texts is compared. Second, an improved Seq2Seq model is proposed to enhance the emotional understanding and interaction capabilities of emotional dialogue generation algorithms in mental health counseling. This study not only provides technological support for college mental health counseling services but also opens new research directions and perspectives for the application of AI in the field of mental health.",10.1177/14727978241302641,5,Scopus,105007158971,2-s2.0-105007158971,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007158971
Problematic smartphone use in a representative sample of US adults: Prevalence and predictors,Rochat L.,2025,Addictive Behaviors,"The exponential growth in worldwide smartphone adoption has led to mounting concerns about problematic smartphone use (PSU), with some studies of variably defined PSU yielding prevalence rates as high as 20 to 30%. The present study aims to (a) estimate the prevalence of PSU while emphasizing functional impairment, and (b) examine the degree to which a set of demographic, contextual, behavioral and mental health variables can predict PSU. A representative U.S. sample of 1,989 participants completed an online survey using a cross-sectional design aimed at examining PSU. Data were analyzed using two different but complementary machine learning algorithms. The results indicate a PSU prevalence of 0.75% to 1.2 % when a functional impairment criterion is required. The most important predictors of PSU are related to smartphone use behavior, followed by contextual factors (being a parent of under-age children, increase in use during the COVID-19 pandemic), age and some psychopathological factors. Overall, the study suggests that the prevalence of functionally impairing PSU may be much lower than what has been reported based on less stringent definitions. The results highlight the necessity to account for impact on key spheres of functioning in diagnosing PSU to avoid pathologizing a ubiquitous behavior that may be intensive but not necessarily pathological. They also open up relevant perspectives for the prevention of PSU.",10.1016/j.addbeh.2024.108228,3,Scopus,85212310733,2-s2.0-85212310733,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212310733

"Supportive use of digital technologies during transition to adult healthcare for young people with long-term conditions, focusing on Type 1 diabetes mellitus: A scoping review",Orpin J.,2025,Journal of Child Health Care,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is the second most common chronic or long-term condition (LTC) affecting young people (YP); when transitioning from paediatric to adult healthcare, young people with LTCs such as T1DM are expected to self-manage medication, diet and clinical appointments. This scoping review aimed to analyse research examining ways digital health technologies were used to support YP with LTCs during transition from paediatric to adult healthcare and to establish YP’s needs, experiences and challenges when transitioning. We aimed to identify knowledge gaps and inform development of a novel chatbot with components such as avatars and linked videos to help YP with T1DM gain self-management confidence and competence during transition. Nineteen studies identified through searching five electronic databases were included in this review. A combination of digital health technologies was used to support transition of YP with LTCs to adult healthcare. Barriers to successful transition were reported and YP described the importance of social relationships and transition readiness and expressed the need for individualised interventions that acknowledge social factors such as work and college.

Feature Selection Using CS - BPSO for Depression Detection Based on Profile Information,Begum S.R.,2025,Ksii Transactions on Internet and Information Systems,"Depression is a common, cross-cultural mental health problem that, if unnoticed and untreated, can progress to a severe condition with serious consequences. Prevention and detection at an early stage are critical for overall health. We focus on detecting depression in college students using machine learning techniques, to identify individuals for a round of counseling, which is confirmatory. There is a possibility of normal individuals being identified as depressed (false positives) and depressed individuals being identified as normal (false negatives), each having a cost associated with them. Given that the costs of FP and FN are unknown and depend on the environment, we have proposed an algorithm that can provide different models for different relative costs of FP and FN. This work proposes a novel cost-sensitive feature selection algorithm using binary particle swarm optimization (CS-BPSO). The experiences and emotions of undergraduate students are collected through a private interview questionnaire form that allows participants to express their opinions freely while maintaining confidentiality. This is performed in conjunction with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) that permits labeling individuals as normal or depressed. The labeling is then validated manually by experts. The entire process has been performed under the guidance of psychiatrists. Results indicate that CS-BPSO consistently obtains the least cost compared to other feature selection algorithms, along with stability in classifier performance. Statistical tests also suggest that CS-BPSO performance is significantly better than other feature selection algorithms.",10.3837/tiis.2025.03.003,0,Scopus,105001565423,2-s2.0-105001565423,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001565423
Predicting clinical improvement in youth using a national-scale multicomponent digital mental health intervention,Cross S.,2025,Behaviour Research and Therapy,"Introduction: Youth mental health services are characterised by high demand and modest clinical outcomes. While digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been shown to be clinically effective, the relationship between DMHI use and outcome is unclear. The current study sought to identify the factors affecting the relationship between DMHI use and depression and anxiety symptom improvement in sub-groups of young people. Method: An observational cohort design included young people aged 12–25 years engaging with a DMHI (MOST) from October 2020 to October 2023. The primary outcome was improvement at 12 weeks on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ4). DMHIs were combinations of self-paced digital cognitive-behavioural therapy content, social network interactions, and professional support. A machine learning clustering algorithm was used to identify distinct user clusters based on baseline characteristics and multiple logistic regression models examined the relationship between DMHI usage and improvement. Results: Two distinct user clusters emerged, differing by symptom severity, age, service setting, and concurrent external treatment. 46.7% of “Severe” users and 39.8% of “Mild-Moderate” users significantly improved. Greater use of therapy content and professional support interactions were associated with improvement for the Mild-Moderate group only (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04–1.30, p = 0.008). Conclusion: While a greater proportion of users in the Severe group significantly improved, increased MOST use was associated with symptom improvement only for the Mild-Moderate group. These findings highlight the complexity of the relationship between DMHI use and outcome. Other unmeasured mediating or moderating factors such concurrent ‘offline’ treatment may help explain the results. Further research is required to better understand the relationship between DMHI use and clinical outcomes.",10.1016/j.brat.2025.104703,1,Scopus,85217907191,2-s2.0-85217907191,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217907191
Development and validation of a machine learning model for prediction of type 2 diabetes in patients with mental illness,Bernstorff M.,2025,Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica,"Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is approximately twice as common among individuals with mental illness compared with the background population, but may be prevented by early intervention on lifestyle, diet, or pharmacologically. Such prevention relies on identification of those at elevated risk (prediction). The aim of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning model for prediction of T2D among patients with mental illness. Methods: The study was based on routine clinical data from electronic health records from the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region. A total of 74,880 patients with 1.59 million psychiatric service contacts were included in the analyses. We created 1343 potential predictors from 51 source variables, covering patient-level information on demographics, diagnoses, pharmacological treatment, and laboratory results. T2D was operationalised as HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol, fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/mol, oral glucose tolerance test ≥11.1 mmol/mol or random plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/mol. Two machine learning models (XGBoost and regularised logistic regression) were trained to predict T2D based on 85% of the included contacts. The predictive performance of the best performing model was tested on the remaining 15% of the contacts. Results: The XGBoost model detected patients at high risk 2.7 years before T2D, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84. Of the 996 patients developing T2D in the test set, the model issued at least one positive prediction for 305 (31%). Conclusion: A machine learning model can accurately predict development of T2D among patients with mental illness based on routine clinical data from electronic health records. A decision support system based on such a model may inform measures to prevent development of T2D in this high-risk population.",10.1111/acps.13687,7,Scopus,85189974826,2-s2.0-85189974826,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189974826
Comparative Efficacy of Ayurveda Treatment Regimen and Letrozole along with Yoga Module in the Management of Unexplained and Anovulatory Female Infertility: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Chandla A.,2025,Complementary Medicine Research,"Introduction: Infertility is a significant health problem with psycho-social burden for couples. Ayurveda considers a holistic approach, including complex multimodal regimens in managing infertility. Increasing evidence has shown that Yoga as an adjuvant to infertility treatment increases pregnancy rates. Therefore, this research will investigate the comparative efficacy of Ayurveda regimen and le?trozole, along with integration of Yoga in both groups in female infertility. Methods: The primary outcome, ovula?tion rate, will be measured through serial transvaginal sonography (TVS) for six consecutive menstrual cycles. The secondary outcome, conception rate, will be measured by definitive signs of pregnancy. Participants quality of life will be assessed using the Ferti Quality of Life (FertiQOL) tool. The study will randomize 160 women aged 21 40 years diagnosed with anovulatory or unexplained infertility into two groups using permuted block ran?domization. Participants in group I will receive internal oleation with Phala Ghrita and mild purgation with Gan?dharvahasta (GH) oil for three consecutive cycles. Standard care group II participants will receive letrozole tablet once daily from day 3 to day 7 of the menstrual cycle for three cycles. The yoga instructor will take yoga sessions for participants of both groups for 6 months. This study will also use machine learning (ML) models to compare two regimens to predict improvements in outcome variables.

Visual Functioning and Mental Health in the Digital Age,Kopilaš V.,2025,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background/Objectives: Considering the omnipresence of digital devices in every aspect of our lives, and from an increasingly younger age, digital eye strain (DES) and dry eye disease (DED) have become a global concern. The main objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the relationship between digital screen use and ocular surface health, as well as the potential negative impact of impaired visual functioning on certain aspects of mental health and daily performance. Methods: Using the PRISMA method, the screening and study selection process resulted in the inclusion of 15 papers published in the electronic databases PubMed and WoS. Results: The findings highlight the prolonged use of digital devices and the concerning prevalence of DED or DES symptoms across different populations. A significant relationship was found between DED and DES symptoms and mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, higher frequency and severity of DED or DES symptoms was associated with reduced sleep quality and difficulties in certain aspects of daily functioning. Conclusions: Given the ongoing exposure to digital devices and increasing prevalence of DED and DES symptoms across all age groups, there is a need to design interventions and programs focused on preserving ocular surface health and improving subjective well-being. The multifaceted impact these symptoms have on physical and mental health, as well as daily functioning, requires a holistic approach, integrating ergonomic interventions, digital hygiene, and mental health support.",10.3390/jcm14051557,0,Scopus,86000558997,2-s2.0-86000558997,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000558997
From social media to artificial intelligence: improving research on digital harms in youth,Mansfield K.L.,2025,Lancet Child and Adolescent Health,"In this Personal View, we critically evaluate the limitations and underlying challenges of existing research into the negative mental health consequences of internet-mediated technologies on young people. We argue that identifying and proactively addressing consistent shortcomings is the most effective method for building an accurate evidence base for the forthcoming influx of research on the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on children and adolescents. Basic research, advice for caregivers, and evidence for policy makers should tackle the challenges that led to the misunderstanding of social media harms. The Personal View has four sections: first, we conducted a critical appraisal of recent reviews regarding effects of technology on children and adolescents' mental health, aimed at identifying limitations in the evidence base; second, we discuss what we think are the most pressing methodological challenges underlying those limitations; third, we propose effective ways to address these limitations, building on robust methodology, with reference to emerging applications in the study of AI and children and adolescents' wellbeing; and lastly, we articulate steps for conceptualising and rigorously studying the ever-shifting sociotechnological landscape of digital childhood and adolescence. We outline how the most effective approach to understanding how young people shape, and are shaped by, emerging technologies, is by identifying and directly addressing specific challenges.

Conversational AI in Pediatric Mental Health: A Narrative Review,Mansoor M.,2025,Children,"Background/Objectives: Mental health disorders among children and adolescents represent a significant global health challenge, with approximately 50% of conditions emerging before age 14. Despite substantial investment in services, persistent barriers such as provider shortages, stigma, and accessibility issues continue to limit effective care delivery. This narrative review examines the emerging application of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in pediatric mental health contexts, mapping the current evidence base, identifying therapeutic mechanisms, and exploring unique developmental considerations required for implementation. Methods: We searched multiple electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus) for literature published between January 2010 and February 2025 that addressed conversational AI applications relevant to pediatric mental health. We employed a narrative synthesis approach with thematic analysis to organize findings across technological approaches, therapeutic applications, developmental considerations, implementation contexts, and ethical frameworks. Results: The review identified promising applications for conversational AI in pediatric mental health, particularly for common conditions like anxiety and depression, psychoeducation, skills practice, and bridging to traditional care. However, most robust empirical research has focused on adult populations, with pediatric applications only beginning to receive dedicated investigation. Key therapeutic mechanisms identified include reduced barriers to self-disclosure, cognitive change, emotional validation, and behavioral activation. Developmental considerations emerged as fundamental challenges, necessitating age-appropriate adaptations across cognitive, emotional, linguistic, and ethical dimensions rather than simple modifications of adult-oriented systems. Conclusions: Conversational AI has potential to address significant unmet needs in pediatric mental health as a complement to, rather than replacement for, human-delivered care. Future research should prioritize developmental validation, longitudinal outcomes, implementation science, safety monitoring, and equity-focused design. Interdisciplinary collaboration involving children and families is essential to ensure these technologies effectively address the unique mental health needs of young people while mitigating potential risks.",10.3390/children12030359,1,Scopus,105001162007,2-s2.0-105001162007,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001162007
Bridging the conversational gap in epilepsy: Using large language models to reveal insights into patient behavior and concerns from online discussions,Fennig U.,2025,Epilepsia,"Objective: This study was undertaken to explore the experiences and concerns of people living with epilepsy by analyzing discussions in an online epilepsy community, using large language models (LLMs) to identify themes, demographic patterns, and associations with emotional distress, substance use, and suicidal ideation. Methods: We analyzed 56 970 posts and responses to them from 21 906 users on the epilepsy forum (subreddit) of Reddit and 768 504 posts from the same users in other subreddits, between 2010 and 2023. LLMs, validated against human labeling, were used to identify 23 recurring themes, assess demographic differences, and examine cross-posting to depression- and suicide-related subreddits. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated to assess the association between specific themes and activity in mental health forums. Results: Prominent topics included seizure descriptions, medication management, stigma, drug and alcohol use, and emotional well-being. The posts on topics less likely to be discussed in clinical settings had the highest engagement. Younger users focused on stigma and emotional issues, whereas older users discussed medical treatments. Posts about emotional distress (HR = 1.3), postictal state (HR = 1.4), surgical treatment (HR =.7), and work challenges (HR = 1.6) predicted activity in a subreddit associated with suicidal ideation, whereas emotional distress (HR = 1.5), surgical treatment (HR =.6), and stigma (HR = 1.3) predicted activity in the depression subreddit. Substance use discussions showed a temporal pattern of association with seizure descriptions, implying possible opportunities for intervention. Significance: LLM analysis of online epilepsy communities provides novel insights into patient concerns often overlooked in clinical settings. These findings may improve patient–provider communication, inform personalized interventions, and support the development of patient-reported outcome measures. Additionally, hazard models can help identify at-risk individuals, offering opportunities for early mental health interventions.",10.1111/epi.18226,1,Scopus,85211477029,2-s2.0-85211477029,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211477029
Learning Satisfaction and Post-Pandemic Adaptation in Highly Sensitive Middle-aged and Elderly Learners in the Face of Digital Learning Stress and Pandemic Anxiety,Wang Y.L.,2025,Journal of Research in Education Sciences,"Introduction Population aging trends and the accelerated promotion and popularization of digital learning in recent years, exacerbated by the global pandemic, have posed significant challenges and impacts to middle-aged and elderly learners on mental health, learning satisfaction, and psychological adoption, especially for middle-aged and elderly individuals with highly sensitive traits. This study aims to investigate the relationship between digital learning stress, pandemic anxiety, depression, learning satisfaction and post-pandemic experiences in highly sensitive middle-aged and elderly learners in the context of the widespread adoption of digital learning due to the pandemic, and explore the role of resilience as a mediating variable. Literature Review Highly Sensitive People (HSP) was first defined by Aron & Aron (1997) as “the in-depth processing (including unconsciousness) of internal and external stimuli under various circumstances, resulting in higher physiological and emotional responses.” The scientific term is “Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS)” People with high sensitivity are more susceptible to stimuli and are less likely to have adverse effects under stress than in the past. However, most studies on highly sensitive trait populations focus on children (Pluess & Boniwell, 2015) and adolescents (Iimura, 2022) as research subjects, there is a lack of research focusing on the elderly as the main research subjects. Organizations and nations worldwide recognize the critical importance of addressing population aging and actively respond to this challenge. Taiwan officially entered an ‘aging society’ in 1993, as the proportion of elderly population exceeded 7%. Sadan et al. (2021) observed that older adults exhibit a weaker adaption capacity to environmental changes. During environmental change, older adults suffered higher pressure. Highly sensitive trait populations are more likely to have negative reactions when stimulated by negative stressful environments (Aron & Aron, 1997). The trait is positively correlated with stress (Andresen et al., 2018; Gearhart & Bodie, 2012; Meyerson et ai., 2020). Systematic review studies indicate that SPS increases the risk of stress-related problems when responding to negative environments, but can also gain greater benefits from positive and supportive experiences (Greven, 2019). Therefore, this study aims to investigate middle-aged and elderly with highly sensitive traits, to explore if this population manifests similarly. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people suffering from depression increased by 25.6% globally (Santomauro et al., 2021). Many research have highlighted the negative impact of the epidemic on mental health. With psychological depression interventions, the life satisfaction and health status of middle-aged and elderly people can be improved, and loneliness can be alleviated (Jo & Kim, 2008). When life satisfaction is significantly improved, depression will decrease (Lee, 2020; MAltun & Yazici, 2015). Reviewing the meta-analysis and literature review related to depression and anxiety, studies have pointed out that brief passive psychoeducation intervention for depression and psychological distress can reduce symptoms (Donker, 2009), and physical activity can reduce depression and anxiety in non-clinical populations (Duncan, 2015). Furthermore, relevant research has pointed out that resilience can serve as a mediating factor that affects the relationship between environmental stress and mental health. (Chang, 2012; Egeland et al., 1993; Faircloth, 2017; Kim et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017). Resilience also mediates the relationship between Covid-19 stress and mental health (including depression and anxiety). The higher the stress related to the epidemic, the lower the resilience, and the higher the depression and anxiety (Ho et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022). As discussed above, resilience is one of the key factors for individuals facing negative environmental stress (including pandemic anxiety, and digital learning stress), which in turn affects their psychological adaptation. Methodology Data collection for this study was conducted through a questionnaire survey targeting individuals aged 45 and above who have experience with digital learning. The questionnaire included 7 scales: highly sensitive people traits, pandemic anxiety, digital learning pressure, depression, learning satisfaction, resilience, and post-epidemic positive moods. The pre-test was conducted in Dec. 2022 by digital questionnaires. A total of 106 valid responses were collected (41 male, 65 female, mean age = 60.00, SD = 1.41). All scales were subjected to exploratory factor analysis after the pre-test. Internal consistency was confirmed and the questions in these constructs were stable and consistent. A total of 208 valid responses were collected (72 male, 136 female, mean age = 57.93, SD = 6.79). The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with the Bootstrap statistical method for mediation analysis. Finding The results of the study revealed the following key findings: 1. Middle-aged and elderly individuals with higher levels of highly sensitive traits experienced higher levels of pandemic anxiety and digital learning stress. 2. Resilience played a significant mediating role in the relationship between pandemic anxiety and depression. Higher pandemic anxiety was associated with lower resilience, leading to increased depression. Additionally, resilience partially mediated the relationship between digital learning stress and depression as well as learning satisfaction. Greater digital learning stress was linked to reduced resilience, resulting in higher depression and lower learning satisfaction. 3. Elevated levels of depression and lower learning satisfaction among elderly individuals were associated with reduced post-pandemic positive experiences. Discussion and Suggestion Finally, several suggestions were proposed for future studies. The current study shows that the role of resilience plays in mediating pandemic anxiety and psychological depression. As well as the relationship between digital learning stress, psychological depression, and learning satisfaction. This suggests that for highly sensitive middle-aged and elderly learners, the higher the pandemic anxiety, the worse resilience, and the psychological depression are. The higher the digital learning stress, the worse resilience, and the psychological depression is, the worse learning satisfaction. In addition, after the peak of the pandemic, the post-pandemic positive experiences are still poor. The study's findings provide the psychological state insights of middle-aged and elderly learners with highly sensitive traits during the pandemic and e-learning environment. Future studies may conduct further research to develop more effective support strategies to enhance the resilience of the middle-aged and elderly. Which may help people face the challenges, reduce psychological depression, and increase their learning satisfaction. Also, improve the post-pandemic positive experiences, and mental health.",10.6209/JORIES.202503_70(1).0005,0,Scopus,105003778734,2-s2.0-105003778734,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003778734
Multivariate prediction of temper outbursts in a sample of youth enriched for irritability using ecological momentary assessment data: A registered report,Saha D.,2025,Plos One,"Irritability and temper outbursts are among the most common reasons youth are referred for psychiatric assessment and care. Identifying in vivo clinical variables that precede the onset of temper outbursts would provide valuable clinical utility. Here, we provide the rationale for a study testing the performance of a classifier trained to predict temper outbursts in a group of clinically-referred youth presenting with symptoms of irritability and temper outbursts. Due to the large sample sizes needed for multivariate classification studies, here, we demonstrated the feasibility of our approach using a relatively large preliminary dataset. Our preliminary data included digital based event sampling from an existing Ecological Momentary Assessment dataset consisting of n= 54 participants with a total of 932 time points. We used this data to develop a logistic regression-based classifier for predicting the temper outburst prospectively. Our initial evaluation provided encouraging evidence for the possibility of predicting the presence of a temper outburst based on individual’s momentary clinical responses (e.g., whether the participant is feeling grouchy, hungry, happy, sad, anxious, tired, etc.) prior to the outburst event, as well as external features (e.g., time of day, day of week). However, due to the risk of false positive discoveries and overfitting, these preliminary results are insufficient to conclusively establish the discovery of predictive rules for irritability in Ecological Momentary Assessment data. To more rigorously assess this classifier, we will collect a large confirmatory set, consisting of at least an additional 20 subjects with an expected total of 400 time points, in which will perform confirmatory analyses of the precision and recall of the classifier already fit using preliminary data. This work will potentially provide the foundation for the identification of features predictive of risk and future development of novel mobile-device-based interventions in youth affected with severe and impairing psychopathology.",10.1371/journal.pone.0289235,0,Scopus,105000383986,2-s2.0-105000383986,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000383986
National Real-Time Surveillance System for Suicide Attempts in Uruguay: Results from the First Year of Implementation,Rando K.,2025,Psychiatry International,"Suicide is a major public health concern, and Uruguay has one of the highest suicide mortality rates in the Americas. In 2022, the Ministry of Public Health implemented a real-time digital surveillance system for suicide attempts as part of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy. This study presents findings from its first year, analysing 4723 emergency department presentations nationwide. The age-standardised suicide attempt rate was 140.44 per 100,000 inhabitants, with women accounting for 71.6% of cases. Self-poisoning was the most common method, followed by hanging and suffocation for men and self-cutting for women. Nearly half of all attempts involved individuals aged 15–29, highlighting the need for youth-focused and gender-sensitive interventions. This study demonstrates the value of real-time surveillance systems in identifying at-risk groups, informing prevention efforts, and supporting timely interventions. While some challenges in system implementation remain, future efforts should focus on strengthening data integration, leveraging artificial intelligence for risk assessment, and improving follow-up care to reduce repeated attempts and overall suicide mortality.",10.3390/psychiatryint6010033,0,Scopus,105000957709,2-s2.0-105000957709,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000957709
Academic-related stressors predict depressive symptoms in graduate students: A machine learning study,Bastos A.F.,2025,Behavioural Brain Research,"Background: Graduate students face higher depression rates worldwide, which were further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employed a machine learning approach to predict depressive symptoms using academic-related stressors. Methods: We surveyed students across four graduate programs at a Federal University in Brazil between October 15, 2021, and March 26, 2022, when most activities were restricted to taking place online due to the pandemic. Through an online self-reported screening, participants rated ten academic stressors and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Machine learning analysis tested whether the stressors would predict depressive symptoms. Gender, age, and race and ethnicity were used as covariates in the predictive model. Results: Participants (n=172), 67.4 % women, mean age: 28.0 (SD: 4.53) fully completed the online questionnaires. The machine learning approach, employing an epsilon-insensitive support vector regression (Ɛ-SVR) with a k-fold (k=5) cross-validation strategy, effectively predicted depressive symptoms (r=0.51; R<sup>2</sup>=0.26; NMSE=0.79; all p=0.001). Among the academic stressors, those that made the greatest contribution to the predictive model were “fear and worry about academic performance”, “financial difficulties”, “fear and worry about academic progress and plans”, and “fear and worry about academic deadlines”. Conclusions: This study highlights the vulnerability of graduate students to depressive symptoms caused by academic-related stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic through an artificial intelligence methodology. These findings have the potential to guide policy development to create intervention programs and public health initiatives targeted towards graduate students.",10.1016/j.bbr.2024.115328,1,Scopus,85208928500,2-s2.0-85208928500,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208928500
A Comprehensive Study on the Relationship between User Experience of Mobile Learning Platforms and Academic Anxiety among College Students,Lu L.,2025,International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies,"With the rapid advancement of information technology, mobile learning platforms have become essential tools for college students to acquire knowledge and enhance their academic performance. However, the widespread use of these platforms has also introduced potential issues such as academic anxiety, adversely affecting students’ learning outcomes and mental health. Existing research indicates a close correlation between the user experience of mobile learning platforms and students’ academic performance and psychological states. A thorough exploration of this relationship can aid in optimizing platform design, enhancing student learning efficiency, and alleviating academic anxiety. Current research methods primarily employ descriptive statistics and correlation analysis, lacking systematic quantitative analysis and the application of modern data mining techniques. This paper utilizes advanced clustering analysis methods to systematically investigate the relationship between college students’ user experiences on mobile learning platforms and their academic anxiety. The study includes predictive modeling based on clustering analysis and a detailed examination and validation of experimental results. The aim of this study is to unveil the intrinsic link between mobile learning platform user experience and academic anxiety, providing a scientific basis for improving platform design and optimizing user experience, thereby promoting the holistic development of college students and enhancing educational quality.",10.3991/ijim.v19i03.53951,1,Scopus,85218417144,2-s2.0-85218417144,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218417144
"Dispositional mindfulness, interoceptive awareness, and panic-agoraphobic spectrum, in a general population sample",Miniati M.,2025,CNS Spectrums,"Objective To investigate dispositional mindfulness (DM), interoceptive awareness (AI), and the occurrence of panic-agoraphobic spectrum signs and symptoms in a non-clinical population. Methods The study involved a general population sample (n = 141), aged between 18 and 40, evaluated with the Panic-Agoraphobic Spectrum Self-Report Lifetime Version (PAS-SR-LT), the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). Instruments were administered with an online procedure (Microsoft Forms). The Bioethics Committee of the University of Pisa approved the study (protocol #0105635/2023). Results Panic-agoraphobic spectrum was detected in more than 50% of our sample (PAS-SR Total Score ≥ 35). According to the MAIA assessment, subjects who scored above the PAS-SR threshold were more afraid and less able to distract attention from their bodily sensations. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate if MAIA and MAAS dimensions were able to predict the presence of a more severe panic-spectrum symptomatology. The PAS-SR cut-off score <35 versus ≥35 was adopted as the dependent variable. Age and gender (categorical), MAAS, and MAIA scores were inserted as covariates. MAAS Total Score (OR =.955; CI =.924-.988; p =.007), and MAIA Not worrying (OR =.826; CI =.707-.964; p =.016) predicted for a less relevant panic-agoraphobic spectrum phenomenology, resulting as protective factors. Conclusions Progression from interoceptive processing to mindful abilities to resilience against panic catastrophizing of bodily sensation is far from being clarified. However, our study provides information on a panic-agoraphobic spectrum phenotype characterized by low levels of mindful attitudes and less interoceptive abilities.",10.1017/S1092852925000100,1,Scopus,85218114826,2-s2.0-85218114826,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218114826
“Maybe It Knows More Than Us” Exploration of Social Robots As Climate Communicators to Foster Climate Hope in Adolescents,Jarske S.,2025,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,"Climate change represents an existential threat that places young people at an increased risk of mental distress. However, climate anxiety, mental distress about climate change, can also coexist with positive emotions such as climate hope. This qualitative study explores the potential of social robots to act as climate communicators, based on their previously demonstrated potential as engaging mediums. Three written scenarios that utilize different climate communication strategies (empathy, information, action) were presented and evaluated with 42 groups of ninth graders (n=115, 42 group responses) through an online questionnaire. The results show that all scenarios elicited positive but also negative reactions. The reactions were the most mixed regarding the empathy scenario. Our findings suggest that a robot could attract young people's interest and should be designed to communicate objectively about climate issues and inform about concrete ways to act. Engaging interaction with such a robot implies the support of artificial intelligence in communication, even though the factual information should be drawn from reliable and objective sources rather than be generated with AI. The sustainability implications of the concept require careful consideration.",10.3233/FAIA241526,0,Scopus,105000778518,2-s2.0-105000778518,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000778518
Suicidal behaviors among high school graduates with preexisting mental health problems: A machine learning and GIS-based study,Al-Mamun F.,2025,International Journal of Social Psychiatry,"Background: Suicidal behavior among adolescents with mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, is a critical issue. This study explores the prevalence and predictors of past-year suicidal behaviors among Bangladeshi high school graduates, employing both traditional statistical and machine learning methods. Aims: To investigate the prevalence and predictors of past-year suicidal behaviors among high school graduates with mental health disorders, evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting these behaviors, and identify geographical disparities. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 1,242 high school graduates (54.1% female) in June 2023, collecting data on sociodemographic characteristics, mental health status, sleep patterns, and digital addiction. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, while machine learning and GIS analyses were conducted with Python and ArcMap 10.8, respectively. Results: Among the participants, 29.9% reported suicidal ideation, 15.3% had suicide plans, and 5.4% attempted suicide in the past year. Significant predictors included rural residence, sleep duration, comorbid depression and anxiety, and digital addiction. Machine learning analyses revealed that permanent residence was the most significant predictor of suicidal behavior, while digital addiction had the least impact. Among the models used, the CatBoost model achieved the highest accuracy (69.42% for ideation, 87.05% for planning, and 94.77% for attempts) and demonstrated superior predictive performance. Geographical analysis showed higher rates of suicidal behaviors in specific districts, though overall disparities were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Enhancing mental health services in rural areas, addressing sleep issues, and implementing digital health and community awareness programs are crucial for reducing suicidal behavior. Future longitudinal research is needed to better understand these factors and develop more effective prevention strategies.",10.1177/00207640241279004,1,Scopus,85203300356,2-s2.0-85203300356,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203300356
Identifying Preliminary Risk Profiles for Dissociation in 16- to 25-Year-Olds Using Machine Learning,McGuinness R.,2025,Early Intervention in Psychiatry,"Introduction: Dissociation is associated with clinical severity, increased risk of suicide and self-harm, and disproportionately affects adolescents and young adults. Whilst evidence indicates multiple factors contribute to dissociative experiences, a multi-factorial explanation of increased risk for dissociation has yet to be achieved. Methods: We used multiple regression to investigate the relative influence of five plausible risk factors (childhood trauma, loneliness, marginalisation, socio-economic status, and everyday stress), and machine learning to generate tentative high-risk profiles for ‘felt sense of anomaly’ dissociation (FSA-dissociation) using cross-sectional online survey data from 2384 UK-based 16- to 25-year-olds. Results: Multiple regression indicated that four risk factors significantly contributed to FSA-dissociation, with relative order of contribution: everyday stress, childhood trauma, loneliness and marginalisation. Exploratory analysis using machine learning suggested dissociation results from a complex interplay between interpersonal, contextual, and intrapersonal pressures: alongside marginalisation and childhood trauma, negative self-concept and depression were important in younger (16–20 years), and anxiety and maladaptive emotion regulation in older (21–25 years) respondents. Conclusions: Validation of these findings could inform clinical assessment, and prevention and outreach efforts, improving the under-recognition of dissociation in mainstream services.",10.1111/eip.70015,3,Scopus,85217372177,2-s2.0-85217372177,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217372177
Enhancing contact recommendation in social platforms through mental health awareness: Exploring Anorexia Nervosa as a case study,Ramírez-Cifuentes D.,2025,Plos One,"We analyze and propose a solution for the exposure of vulnerable users to harmful content during their interaction with contact recommender systems in social platforms. Our approach is dedicated to maximizing the number of harmless accounts suggested to users at risk. For these users, the over-personalization of recommender systems can result in an exposure to triggering content. We consider anorexia nervosa as a use case. People with anorexia tend to seek accounts of peers that support their unhealthy habits. Contact recommender systems can unintentionally reinforce such behaviors. Our approach modifies the objective function of a content and topology-based recommendation algorithm to maximize the suggestion of harmless accounts for users at risk. This is done with data from Twitter of Spanish speaking users with anorexia. The design and evaluation of the proposal has involved the participation of clinicians and volunteers at the last stages of treatment. Results show that users with anorexia are willing to follow harmless accounts suggested in online platforms. There is a tradeoff in precision (Pr) when comparing our proposal (Pr = 0.41) with a regular recommendation approach (Pr = 0.58). However, results are promising as there is a 55% increase in the percentage of harmless accounts suggested.",10.1371/journal.pone.0312766,0,Scopus,85217455560,2-s2.0-85217455560,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217455560
Predicting Diagnostic Conversion From Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar Disorder: An EHR Based Study From Colombia,Service S.K.,2025,Bipolar Disorders,"Objectives: Most bipolar disorder (BD) patients initially present with depressive symptoms, resulting in a delayed diagnosis of BD and poor clinical outcomes. This study aims to identify features predictive of the conversion from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) to BD by leveraging electronic health record (EHR) data from the Clínica San Juan de Dios Manizales in Colombia. Methods: We employed a multivariable Cox regression model to identify important predictors of conversion from MDD to BD. Results: Analyzing 15 years of EHR data from 13,607 patients diagnosed with MDD, a total of 1610 (11.8%) transitioned to BD. Predictive features of the conversion to BD included severity of the initial MDD episode, presence of psychosis and hospitalization at first episode, family history of BD, and female gender. Additionally, we observed associations with medication classes (positive associations with prescriptions of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and negative associations with antidepressants) and a positive association with suicidality, a feature derived from natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes. Together, these risk factors predicted BD conversion within 5 years of the initial MDD diagnosis, with a recall of 72% and a precision of 38%. Conclusions: Our study confirms previously identified risk factors identified through registry-based studies (female gender and psychotic depression at the index MDD episode) and identifies novel ones (suicidality extracted from clinical notes). These results simultaneously demonstrate the validity of using EHR data for predicting BD conversion and underscore its potential for the identification of novel risk factors, thereby improving early diagnosis.",10.1111/bdi.13512,1,Scopus,85211796254,2-s2.0-85211796254,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211796254
Remote monitoring of social attention in neurogenetic syndromes and idiopathic neurodevelopmental disability,Frazier T.W.,2025,Autism Research,"Social attention is a key aspect of neurodevelopment and is significantly altered in neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes and many individuals with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The primary aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of webcam-collected social attention measurements, including four new specific aspects of social attention, in three genetic syndromes (PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome—PHTS; Malan Syndrome—NFIX; and SYNGAP1-related disorder—SYNGAP1), a mixed group of other neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes (Other NDGS), and individuals with a range of idiopathic neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). The secondary aim was to evaluate the construct validity of these social attention measurements, including evaluating known-groups validity across study groups and concurrent validity for separating ASD and non-ASD cases. Participants (N = 467, age 3–45; PHTS n = 102, NFIX n = 23, SYNGAP1 n = 42, other NDGS n = 63, idiopathic NDD n = 53, neurotypical siblings n = 71, and unrelated neurotypical controls n = 113) completed a 4-min online-administered social attention paradigm that includes a variety of distinct stimuli at three timepoints (baseline, 1-month, and 4-month follow-up). Social attention measures had good scale and test–retest reliability, with the exception of measures of non-social preference and face-specific processing. Unique patterns of social attention emerged across study groups, with near neurotypical levels in PHTS and weaker social attention in NFIX and SYNGAP1 relative to controls. Global social attention had good accuracy in detecting ASD within NDGS participants. Remote monitoring social attention, including distinct aspects of social attention, may be useful for characterizing phenotypic profiles and tracking the natural history of distinct NDGS and idiopathic NDD as well as identifying ASD within NDGS. Given their reproducibility and stability, global social attention and several distinct social attention measures may be useful outcomes for future clinical trials.",10.1002/aur.3290,1,Scopus,85211141985,2-s2.0-85211141985,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211141985
Impact of loneliness and living alone on negative symptoms in severe mental illness: An electronic health record data analysis,Alarcón-Yaquetto D.E.,2025,Schizophrenia Research,"Important changes in symptom profiles occur early in the course of severe mental illness (SMI) after its clinical presentation. The emergence of negative symptoms is of particular concern for later function, and these may well have strong links with loneliness and poor social support which are also recognised to be common. However, the impact of loneliness and social isolation on symptoms and treatment outcomes remains unclear. To explore this, we conducted a retrospective observational analysis using data from electronic health records of a large mental health provider in London. Loneliness, living alone and symptoms of SMI were extracted using bespoke natural language processing algorithms. Symptoms were grouped into five domains: positive, negative, disorganised, manic, and catatonic, and were measured at diagnosis and 12 months following the initial SMI diagnosis. Loneliness and living alone were operationalised as binary variables, based on any recording during the follow-up period. A total of 8237 records were analysed. The prevalence of loneliness was 20.4 % and living alone 19.9 %, with only 6.8 % recorded with both. Recorded loneliness was associated with an increase in negative symptoms over the follow-up period, in models adjusted by sociodemographic variables and pharmacological treatment [OR 1.28 (1.11–1.48), p = 0.001], as was living alone to a weaker extent [OR 1.18 (1.02–1.36), p = 0.030]. No associations were found between either exposure variable and changes in symptoms from other domains. Given that negative symptoms are disabling and challenging to treat, these results highlight the importance of effective interventions to enhance social support in SMI over the early post-diagnostic period.",10.1016/j.schres.2025.01.021,3,Scopus,85216843866,2-s2.0-85216843866,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216843866
Using Machine Learning to Predict Weight Gain in Adults: an Observational Analysis From the All of Us Research Program,Jawara D.,2025,Journal of Surgical Research,"Introduction: Obesity, defined as a body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, is a major public health concern in the United States. Preventative approaches are essential, but they are limited by an inability to accurately predict individuals at highest risk of weight gain. Our objective was to develop accurate weight gain prediction models using the National Institutes of Health All of Us dataset. We hypothesized that machine learning models using both electronic health record and behavioral survey data would outperform models using electronic health record data alone. Methods: The All of Us dataset was used to identify adults between 18 and 70 ys old with weight measurements 2 y apart between 2008 and 2022. Patients with a history of cancer, bariatric surgery, or pregnancy were excluded. Demographics, vital signs, laboratory results, comorbidities, and survey data (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical and mental health scores) were included as model parameters. Elastic net and XGBoost machine learning models were developed with and without survey data to predict ≥10% total body weight gain within 2 y. The data were split into a training sample (60%) and a testing sample (40%), and parameters were tuned using 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Results: Our cohort consisted of 34,715 patients (mean [SD] age 50.9 [13.4] y; 45.7% White; 55.3% female). Over a 2-y span, 10.4% of the cohort gained ≥10% total body weight. AUCs were 0.677 [95% DeLong confidence interval 0.665-0.688] for elastic net and 0.706 [0.695-0.717] for XGBoost. Incorporation of survey data did not improve predictability, with AUCs of 0.681 [0.669-0.692] and 0.705 [0.694-0.716], respectively. Conclusions: Our machine learning weight gain prediction models had modest performance that was not improved by survey data. The addition of other All of Us variables, including genomic data, may be informative in future studies.",10.1016/j.jss.2024.11.042,4,Scopus,85213536044,2-s2.0-85213536044,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213536044
Development of individualized risk assessment models for predicting post-traumatic epilepsy 1 and 2 years after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury: A traumatic brain injury model system study,Awan N.,2025,Epilepsia,"Objective: Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) are common, there are no prospective models quantifying individual epilepsy risk after moderate-to-severe TBI (msTBI). We generated parsimonious prediction models to quantify individual epilepsy risk between acute inpatient rehabilitation for individuals 2 years after msTBI. Methods: We used data from 6089 prospectively enrolled participants (≥16 years) in the TBI Model Systems National Database. Of these, 4126 individuals had complete seizure data collected over a 2-year period post-injury. We performed a case-complete analysis to generate multiple prediction models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression. Baseline predictors were used to assess 2-year seizure risk (Model 1). Then a 2-year seizure risk was assessed excluding the acute care variables (Model 2). In addition, we generated prognostic models predicting new/recurrent seizures during Year 2 post-msTBI (Model 3) and predicting new seizures only during Year 2 (Model 4). We assessed model sensitivity when keeping specificity ≥.60, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and AUROC model performance through 5-fold cross-validation (CV). Results: Model 1 (73.8% men, 44.1 ± 19.7 years, 76.1% moderate TBI) had a model sensitivity = 76.00% and average AUROC =.73 ±.02 in 5-fold CV. Model 2 had a model sensitivity = 72.16% and average AUROC =.70 ±.02 in 5-fold CV. Model 3 had a sensitivity = 86.63% and average AUROC =.84 ±.03 in 5-fold CV. Model 4 had a sensitivity = 73.68% and average AUROC =.67 ±.03 in 5-fold CV. Cranial surgeries, acute care seizures, intracranial fragments, and traumatic hemorrhages were consistent predictors across all models. Demographic and mental health variables contributed to some models. Simulated, clinical examples model individual PTE predictions. Significance: Using information available, acute-care, and year-1 post-injury data, parsimonious quantitative epilepsy prediction models following msTBI may facilitate timely evidence-based PTE prognostication within a 2-year period. We developed interactive web-based tools for testing prediction model external validity among independent cohorts. Individualized PTE risk may inform clinical trial development/design and clinical decision support tools for this population.",10.1111/epi.18210,1,Scopus,85211439840,2-s2.0-85211439840,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211439840
Exploring pre-diagnosis hospital contacts in women with endometriosis using ICD-10: a Danish case–control study,Melgaard A.,2025,Human Reproduction,"STUDY QUESTION: How does pre-diagnosis use of hospital care differentiate between women later diagnosed with endometriosis and age-matched controls without a diagnosis? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women with hospital-diagnosed endometriosis had more frequent hospital contacts in the 10 years leading up to the diagnosis compared to women without a diagnosis of endometriosis, and the contacts were related to registered diagnoses in nearly all of the included ICD-10 chapters for the entire period. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Only a few studies have investigated the utilization of health care among women with endometriosis in the time before diagnosis, but current research shows that women with endometriosis have a higher utilization compared to women without diagnosed endometriosis. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the type of contact related to the higher utilization by using the ICD-10 diagnoses registered to the hospital contact. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study was conducted as a national Danish registry-based case–control study of 129 696 women. Cases were women with a first-time hospital-based diagnosis of endometriosis between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Using density sampling, we identified 21 616 cases. Each case was matched on age at the date of diagnosis (index date) to five women without hospital-diagnosed endometriosis (n ¼ 108 080) at the time of matching. The utilization and registered ICD-10 diagnoses related to the hospital contact were included for the 10 years before the index date. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The probability of having a high number of hospital contacts (six or more) was more common among women with endometriosis (68.6%) compared to women without endometriosis (55.7%) In general, women without endometriosis were more likely to have fewer than six contacts. The diagnoses registered to the contact among cases were related to a greater variety of ICD-10 chapters when compared to controls with the same number of contacts. For nearly all of the included ICD-10 chapters, women with endometriosis were more likely to have a diagnosis over the entire period compared to controls, with the only exception being in the chapter related to pregnancy. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our results are only applicable for women with hospital-based diagnosed endometriosis since we were not able to include women diagnosed at the general practitioner or private gynecologists. We were not able to make a causal interpretation, as we do not have information on the onset of symptoms of the included diseases. The association may be overestimated due to detection bias. However, a sensitivity analysis only changed the results slightly, indicating a low risk of this bias. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study is in accordance with previous studies on the subject, indicating that the utilization of health care prior to endometriosis is not necessarily restricted to endometriosis-related symptoms and that endometriosis can be associated with many other diseases.

Comparison of the impact of type 1 and type 2 diabetes on quality of life of families of patients: A UK cross-sectional study,Shah R.,2025,Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism,"Aim: To measure the impact of type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (T1D and T2D) on the QoL of a person's family members/partner and assess if there is any difference in family impact. Methods: A cross-sectional study, recruited online through patient support groups, involved UK family members/partners of people with diabetes completing the Family Reported Outcome Measure-16 (FROM-16). Results: Two hundred and sixty-one family members/partners (mean age = 57.9 years, SD = 13.8; females = 68.2%) of people with diabetes (mean age = 57.7, SD = 20.6; females = 38.3%; T1D n = 100; T2D n = 161) completed the FROM-16. The overall FROM-16 mean score was 10.47, SD = 7.8, suggesting a moderate effect on the QoL of family members of people with diabetes. A quarter (24.5%) of family members experienced a ‘very large effect’ or ‘extremely large effect’ on their QoL. The family impact of T1D (mean FROM-16 = 12.61, SD = 7.9) was greater than that of T2D (mean = 9.15, SD = 7.5, p < 0.01), with being ‘female’ and ‘parents of children and adolescents’ rendered as significant predictors of greater impact. Family members of T2D had a lower risk of experiencing a high family impact (FROM-16 score >16) compared with T1D (RR 0.561, 95% CI 0.371–0.849). Conclusions: Compared to T2D, family members of T1D experience a greater impact on their QoL, particularly those caring for children and adolescents. These findings have clinical and resource implications, indicating a need to assess this impact as a part of routine diabetes care to support impacted family members. The FROM-16 could assess this impact in routine practice and further facilitate referral of family members to appropriate support services.",10.1111/dom.16058,1,Scopus,85210024552,2-s2.0-85210024552,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210024552

Digital phenotyping from wearables using AI characterizes psychiatric disorders and identifies genetic associations,Liu J.J.,2025,Cell,"Psychiatric disorders are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, their study is hindered by limitations on precisely characterizing human behavior. New technologies such as wearable sensors show promise in surmounting these limitations in that they measure heterogeneous behavior in a quantitative and unbiased fashion. Here, we analyze wearable and genetic data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Leveraging >250 wearable-derived features as digital phenotypes, we show that an interpretable AI framework can objectively classify adolescents with psychiatric disorders more accurately than previously possible. To relate digital phenotypes to the underlying genetics, we show how they can be employed in univariate and multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Doing so, we identify 16 significant genetic loci and 37 psychiatric-associated genes, including ELFN1 and ADORA3, demonstrating that continuous, wearable-derived features give greater detection power than traditional case-control GWASs.

Girltelligence: A safe and supportive social community app for teen girls and young women,Barnea-Goraly N.,2025,First Monday,"Young people’s mental health has deteriorated over the last decade, especially among females. Rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm have soared while well-being has declined. This mental health crisis has coincided with increased use of smartphones and social media, the extended isolation and suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and attacks on reproductive rights. These recent stressors have compounded the historic challenges women and girls have always faced while growing up, at school, in society, and in the workplace. In this paper, we examine the mental health effects of social media on young people, focusing on females. In an effort to address the current crisis, we designed a mobile app, Girltelligence, that provides a safe online space for girls and young women to advise and support one another on any topics without judgment and without the negative mental health impacts associated with mainstream social media.

Mental Health Issues and 24-Hour Movement Guidelines–Based Intervention Strategies for University Students With High-Risk Social Network Addiction: Cross-Sectional Study Using a Machine Learning Approach,Luo L.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The exponential growth of digital technologies and the ubiquity of social media platforms have led to unprecedented mental health challenges among college students, highlighting the critical need for effective intervention approaches. Objective: This study aimed to explore the relationship between meeting the 24-hour movement guidelines (24-HMG) health behavior combinations and the risk of social network addiction (SNA) as well as mental health issues among university students. It further sought to compare differences in mental health indicators and SNA levels across various risk groups and adherence patterns, and to identify the optimal 24-HMG health behavior intervention strategies for students at high risk of SNA. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited a total of 12,541 university students from the university town of Guizhou Province as participants. Data were collected through standardized questionnaires, including the Chinese version of Social Network Addiction Scale for College Students (SNAS-C), the adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) self-report scale (ASRS), and the Chinese version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) Self-Report Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure for Adults (DSM-5 CCSM), among others. The primary analytical method used was the random forest model, which was used to explore the relationship between different 24-HMG behavior combinations and mental health variables among student at high-risk of SNA. In addition, the study aimed to identify the optimal 24-HMG health behavior intervention strategies for this high-risk group. Results: Participants in the meeting none group exhibited the highest SNA scores (57.98), which declined progressively with greater adherence. Among single-guideline groups, meeting physical activity (PA; 53.07) and meeting sedentary time (ST; 52.72) showed similar scores. Further reductions were seen in meeting PA+ST (49.68), meeting sleep (48.44), and meeting ST+sleep (44.75), with the lowest in meeting PA+ST+sleep. Approximately 6% of the variance in SNA was attributable to differences in adherence patterns (η<sup>2=0.06).</sup> Students meeting all three 24-HMG components—PA, sleep, and ST—demonstrated the strongest protection against attention deficit, depression, and anxiety. All 24-HMG behaviors were inversely associated with mental health symptoms, except academic satisfaction, which was positively correlated. Random forest modeling identified meeting sleep+ST as the most impactful for mania (0.4491), sleep disturbance (0.4032), personality (0.3924), and dissociation (0.3832). Meeting ST alone showed the strongest effects on substance (0.6176) and alcohol use (0.6597). Depression was influenced by meeting sleep+ST (0.2053), meeting PA+ST+sleep (0.1650), and meeting PA+ST (0.1634). The model achieved high accuracy for ASRS (0.912; F<inf>1</inf>-score=0.927), with robust predictions for substance use (F<inf>1</inf>-score=0.873) and mania (F<inf>1</inf>-score=0.836). Conclusions: Adherence to the health behaviors recommended by the 24-HMG can significantly improve the mental health outcomes of university students at high risk for SNA. The findings of this study support the development of mental health intervention strategies for students at high-risk of SNA based on the 24-HMG framework.",10.2196/72260,0,Scopus,105008540233,2-s2.0-105008540233,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008540233
Ontology and AI Integration for Real-Time Detection of Cyberbullying Among University Students,Ahmed K.,2025,International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems Iceis Proceedings,"With the increasing of the internet, smartphones, and social media, nearly everyone is a potential target for cyberbullying. Our research introduces an AI-driven approach to detect and address cyberbullying among college students, with a focus on its impact on mental health. We developed a context-specific ontology, drawing from real-time data, publicly available data, surveys, academic literature, and social media interactions to categorize information into domains such as victims, causes, types, environments, impacts, and responses. We collected real-time data from college students through surveys, interviews, and social media, leveraging advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and BERT for accurate and efficient detection. By integrating this ontology with AI, our system dynamically adapts to emerging cyberbullying patterns, offering more precise detection and response strategies. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 96.2% accuracy, with 95.8% precision, 95.5% recall, and an F1-score of 95.6%. This performance surpasses traditional methods, emphasizing its capability to identify both explicit and implicit forms of abusive behavior. The approach not only introduces a tailored ontology for college students' unique social dynamics but also offers solutions to evolving cyberbullying trends.

Validity of Perceived Stress Scale in Brazilian low-income college students,Rosa A.C.A.,2025,Revista De Saude Publica,"OBJECTIVE: We tested the reliability and validity of the Perceived Stress Scale, an online questionnaire, among college students from low-income Brazilian regions. METHODS: We assessed 195 college students from a region with a Gini index of 0.56 for the validity study and a subsample of 117 students for the reliability study, where we evaluated the Perceived Stress Scale with the 14 original items. We also applied the shortened version of the Brief Symptom Inventory with 18 items (BSI-18). The psychometric properties analyzed, including temporal stability, internal consistency, and structural and convergent validity, were assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, unsupervised machine learning, and confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The questionnaire showed acceptable reliability (temporal stability [rho ≥ 0.32] and internal consistency [alpha ≥ 0.79]. In construct validity, we identified two clusters, “helplessness” and “self-efficacy”, as structure solutions for our sample via unsupervised machine learning. An acceptable fit for the two-factor structure of the scale was indicated by multiple indices (chi-square/degrees of freedom [χ2/df] = 119/76; Tucker-Lewis Index [TLI] = 0.916; Comparative Fit Index [CFI] = 0.930; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.054; standardized root mean-squared residual [SRMR] = 0.078)) on confirmatory factor analysis. Moreover, convergent validity was supported by significant correlations of the BSI-18 Global Severity Index score with perception of helplessness (rho = 0.71) and self-efficacy (rho = -0.42).

Acoustic-based machine learning approaches for depression detection in Chinese university students,Wei Y.,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,"Background: Depression is major global public health problems among university students. Currently, the evaluation and monitoring of depression predominantly depend on subjective and self-reported methods. There is an urgent necessity to develop objective means of identifying depression. Acoustic features, which convey emotional information, have the potential to enhance the objectivity of depression assessments. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of utilizing acoustic features for the objective and automated identification and characterization of depression among Chinese university students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken involving 103 students with depression and 103 controls matched for age, gender, and education. Participants' voices were recorded using a smartphone as they read neutral texts. Acoustic analysis and feature extraction were performed using the OpenSMILE toolkit, yielding 523 features encompassing spectral, glottal, and prosodic characteristics. These extracted acoustic features were utilized for discriminant analysis between depression and control groups. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between acoustic features and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. Five machine learning algorithms including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest were used to perform the classification. For training and testing, ten-fold cross-validation was employed. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used for model interpretation. Results: In depression group, 32 acoustic features (25 spectral features, 5 prosodic features and 2 glottal features) showed significant alterations compared with controls. Further, 27 acoustic features (10 spectral features, 3 prosodic features, and 1 glottal features) were significantly correlated with depression severity. Among five machine learning algorithms, LDA model demonstrated the highest classification performance, with an AUC of 0.771. SHAP analysis suggested that Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features contributed most to the model's classification efficacy. Conclusions: The integration of acoustic features and LDA model demonstrates a high accuracy in distinguishing depression among Chinese university students, suggesting its potential utility in rapid and large-scale depression screening. MFCC may serve as objective and valid features for the automated identification of depression on Chinese university campuses.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1561332,0,Scopus,105006926414,2-s2.0-105006926414,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006926414
EquiMood: Elevating Emotional Wellness for College Students Through the Power of Machine Learning,Baniya A.,2025,Proceedings of the International Conference on Multi Agent Systems for Collaborative Intelligence Icmsci 2025,"Depression is a common mental disorder that affects millions of people in the world, and thus correct identification cannot be overemphasized. Focusing on two approaches - Streamlit and Ngrok vs Botpress - this work aims to explore the application of chatbots in offering emotional support to college students. To this end, the chatbots use rule-based systems and machine learning to try to provide support to kids who are struggling emotionally. Other measures such as throughput, latency and dependability are among the measures employed in the study to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of these two approaches. It also aims at the feasibility of deploying (or not) chatbots for offering mental support to the users by considering the user perspective, outcomes, and accessibility. Consequently, the present research contributes to elucidate the potential advantages and disadvantages of using chatbots for moderating emotional demands of college students and inform the future innovation and adoption of such technologies in educational context.",10.1109/ICMSCI62561.2025.10894479,0,Scopus,105000515417,2-s2.0-105000515417,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000515417
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) use and dependence: an approach from behavioral economics,Robayo-Pinzon O.,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,"Objective: This study aims to explore the perceived dependence on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools among young adults and examine the relative reinforcing value of AI chatbots use compared to monetary rewards, applying a behavioral economics approach. Participants/methods: A total of 420 university students from Bogotá, Colombia, participated in an online survey. The study employed a Multiple Choice Procedure (MCP) to assess the relative reinforcement between different durations of GenAI use (1, 2, and 4 weeks) and monetary rewards, which varied in amount and delay. Additionally, an adapted AI Dependence Scale evaluated levels of dependence on AI tools. Data analysis included repeated measures ANOVA to examine the effects of reward magnitude and delay on choices, and correlations to assess the relationship between perceived dependence and reinforcement values. Results: Participants reported low average dependence on AI tools (mean AI Dependence Scale score = 65.6), with no significant gender differences. MCP findings indicated significant differences in crossover points across varying durations or delays for AI chatbots use, suggesting a higher relative value of use for the option to use AI chatbots immediately. The average reinforcement value for AI use versus monetary rewards did significantly vary with reward magnitude. On the other hand, significant differences were found in the levels of perceived dependence on AI, according to the average daily time of AI tool use. Conclusion: The results suggest that young adults exhibit low perceived dependence on GenAI tools but show differential reinforcement values based on usage duration or delay conditions. This behavioral economics approach provides novel insights into decision-making patterns related to AI chatbots use, emphasizing the need for further research to understand the psychological and social factors influencing dependence on AI technologies.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1634121,1,Scopus,105013651701,2-s2.0-105013651701,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013651701
Construction of physiological anxiety beyond individual pathology: integrating psychophysiological biomarkers and socio-digital contexts among university students in a post-pandemic world,E. Khuda I.,2025,Critical Public Health,"As digital platforms increasingly mediate mental health care, a critical gap persists in understanding how digital engagement and social connectedness influence physiological anxiety, especially in contexts marked by structural inequality, cultural hierarchies and digital saturation, such as Pakistan. This study investigates how active versus passive social media use, combined with perceived social connectedness, affects heart rate variability (HRV), a physiological marker of stress, among university students. Using a biopsychosocial and political economy framework, we conducted real-time HRV monitoring during cognitive stress tasks via a mobile-based system. Results indicate that passive media use in low-connectedness settings is associated with significantly lower HRV, reflecting heightened physiological anxiety, whereas active use in socially embedded contexts predicts higher HRV and better autonomic regulation. These findings show that the emotional and physiological impacts of digital engagement are stratified by relational and sociotechnical factors. HRV emerges as a meaningful biomarker of anxiety when situated within broader social and digital ecologies. While empirically grounded in Pakistan, the findings reflect structural patterns across the Global South, where similar platform logics, infrastructural precarity, and sociocultural hierarchies shape digital mental health risks. The study contributes to critical public health by underscoring the need for equity-driven, context-sensitive digital mental health strategies.",10.1080/09581596.2025.2574960,0,Scopus,105019685087,2-s2.0-105019685087,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019685087

Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Mental Health Data Processing for College Students,Liang X.,2025,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"With the development of China's higher education, the mental health of college students is receiving more and more attention. The mental health management of college students cannot be limited to the systematic data storage of them, but should be reasonably utilized and processed into objective, visual and predictable results to avoid accidents. Based on the SPSS data analysis platform, this paper adopts the decision tree algorithm to comprehensively mine and analyze the data in the database, so as to better manage the mental health of college students. In this paper, after the comparison and analysis with SVM algorithm model proved that the accuracy and checking rate of classification prediction test set of SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm are 83.12 and 66.13%, respectively, and the accuracy and checking rate of classification prediction test set of C5.0 algorithm are 85% and 75.13%, respectively.",10.1007/978-981-96-2794-3_8,0,Scopus,86000022640,2-s2.0-86000022640,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000022640
A Hybrid Dialogue System for Student Mental Health Assessment and Support,Lenh P.P.C.,2025,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"With the increasing prevalence of mental health issues, especially among university students, depression has emerged as a concern requiring effective support. To partially mitigate this, we develop a Vietnamese dialogue system that automates mental healthcare services for students facing significant stress. The system has a hybrid architecture that combines a large language model-based chatbot with a finite-state dialogue system to address two crucial tasks: (1) addressing inquiries related to student mental health issues and (2) assessing depression levels using standardized questionnaires. Furthermore, a user intent detector is employed to enable flexible switching between these two tasks during the conversation. Due to the lack of Vietnamese benchmarks regarding student mental health, we carefully collected and manually annotated a dataset for the testing phase. The dataset can be a student mental health benchmark for testing Vietnamese dialogue systems. The conducted experiments on the generated dataset demonstrate the system’s ability to provide meaningful psychological support and deliver accurate depression assessments, representing a promising approach to addressing mental health challenges among college students.",10.1007/978-3-031-80943-9_86,0,Scopus,105000964854,2-s2.0-105000964854,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000964854
Integrating biomechanics and biosensors for enhancing college students’ physical health and ideological literacy,Liu C.,2025,Mcb Molecular and Cellular Biomechanics,"College students face a wide variety of challenges in the educational process, including physical and mental stressors, with implications for their overall well-being and academic performance. Ideological and political education (IPE) is an important aspect of higher education, fostering in students a sense of concern for broader societal issues, encouraging politically critical thinking, and promoting responsibility for their communities. However, mental illness undermines such literacy, as it inhibits the ability of students to engage properly with the concepts. It discusses how a biosensor-integrated health education platform can contribute to developing college students’ ideological and political literacy (IPL). The platform works by leveraging biomechanics and biosensors to monitor physiological factors, such as heart rate, stress levels, sleep quality, physical activity and biomechanics, making it probable for students to receive real-time feedback on their physiological states. In addition to helping improve students’ physical health, the platform also fosters ideological and political literacy by developing self-awareness, resilience, and social responsibility as essential qualities of active citizenship. Regression analysis, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and student t-tests are used to measure effectiveness. The levels of depression and anxiety among students are also measured. The results show significant correlations between mental health indicators and improvements in ideological and political literacy, which means that the platform has the potential to combine physical health, biomechanics, mental well-being, and moral education into a single comprehensive framework for education. It promotes not only physical but also cognitive and emotional growth for the development of well-rounded, socially conscious individuals through the integration of health data with personalized interventions.",10.62617/mcb967,0,Scopus,85214467397,2-s2.0-85214467397,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214467397
Development of a Mobile Intervention for Procrastination Augmented With a Semigenerative Chatbot for University Students: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Lee S.,2025,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Procrastination negatively affects university students’ academics and mental health. Traditional time management apps lack therapeutic strategies like cognitive behavioral therapy to address procrastination’s psychological aspects. Therefore, we developed and integrated a semigenerative chatbot named Moa into a to-do app. Objective: We intended to determine the benefits of the Moa-integrated to-do app over the app without Moa by verifying behavioral and cognitive changes, analyzing the influence of engagement patterns on the changes, and exploring the user experience. Methods: The developed chatbot Moa guided users over 30 days in terms of self-observation, strategy establishment, and reflection. The architecture comprised response-generating and procrastination factor–detection algorithms. A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted with 85 participants (n=37, 44% female; n=48, 56% male) from a university in South Korea. The control group used a to-do app without Moa, whereas the treatment group used a fully automated Moa-integrated app. The Irrational Procrastination Scale, Pure Procrastination Scale, Time Management Behavior Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale were examined using linear mixed models with repeated measurements obtained before (T0) and after (T1) 1-month use and after 2-month use (T2) to assess the changes in irrational procrastination, pure procrastination, time management and behavior, academic self-regulation, and stress. Intervention engagement, divided into “high,” “middle” and “low” clusters, was quantified using app access and use of the to-do list and grouped using k-means clustering. In addition, changes in the psychological scale scores between the control and treatment groups were analyzed within each cluster. User experience was quantified based on the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of and satisfaction with the app, whereas thematic analysis explored the users’ subjective responses to app use. Results: In total, 75 participants completed the study. The interaction of time × procrastination was significant during the required use period (P=.01). The post hoc test indicated a significant improvement from T0 to T1 in the Time Management Behavior Scale and Perceived Stress Scale scores only in the treatment group (P<.001 and P=.009). The changes in Pure Procrastination Scale score after the required use period were significant in all clusters except for the low cluster of the control group. The high cluster in the treatment group exhibited a significant change in the Irrational Procrastination Scale after Bonferroni correction (P=.046). Usability was determined to be good in the treatment group (mean score 72.8, SD 16.0), and acceptability was higher than in the control group (P=.03). Evaluation of user experience indicated that only the participants in the treatment group achieved self-reflection and experienced an alliance with the app. Conclusions: The chatbot-integrated app demonstrated greater efficacy in influencing user behavior providing psychological support. It will serve as a valuable tool for managing procrastination and stress together.",10.2196/53133,2,Scopus,105003124705,2-s2.0-105003124705,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003124705
A Cognitive AI Model Using Deep & Cross Network for Personalized Gamified Recommendations to Promote Healthy Eating Decisions among University Students,Quenta Leon L.A.,2025,2025 3rd Cognitive Models and Artificial Intelligence Conference Aicconf 2025 Proceedings,"Unhealthy eating habits among university students represent a critical public health challenge, adversely affecting physical health, mental well-being, and academic performance. While existing solutions leverage mobile apps and wearables, they lack robust cognitive artificial intelligence for personalized interventions and fail to sustain engagement through gamification. Previous efforts have employed deep learning models such as LSTM for dietary event detection and gamified frameworks, yet they neglect the integration of AI precision with long-term behavioral incentives. Current tools exhibit limited personalization, poor scalability, and insufficient validation in real-world contexts, particularly for diverse student populations. Motivated by these gaps, this study proposes a cognitive AI framework using a Deep and Cross Network integrated into a gamified mobile application to predict nutritional status and deliver tailored dietary challenges. The DCN model was trained on data from 5,000 Peruvian students, incorporating behavioral, demographic, and biometric variables, and validated against baseline models using stratified 80-20 splits, five-fold cross-validation, and metrics including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC. The DCN achieved superior precision of 92.89% and AUC-ROC of 94.02%, outperforming BNN and NCF by modeling nonlinear feature interactions such as BMI and sleep quality. This research advances human-AI interaction by synergizing cognitive modeling with gamification, demonstrating enhanced user engagement and offering a replicable framework for sustainable dietary behavior change.",10.1109/AICCONF64766.2025.11063812,0,Scopus,105012251230,2-s2.0-105012251230,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012251230

Personalized Stress Detection for University Students using Wearable Devices,Hoang T.H.,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 19th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication Imcom 2025,"University students frequently experience elevated stress levels, which can affect their mental well-being and academic performance. Wearable sensor data provides a promising solution for real-time stress detection and intervention. In this study, we present a personalized stress detection system targeting university students using the publicly available WESAD dataset. The system begins with the development of a baseline model utilizing XGBoost, selected for its balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for future real-time applications. To enhance detection accuracy, we fine-tune the baseline model for each individual student using transfer learning, allowing the model to adapt pre-learned patterns to the specific physiological responses of each individual. This process refines the decision boundaries of the baseline model, better capturing individual variations in stress responses, leading to a significant improvement in precision, recall, and overall detection accuracy. For example, in one case, the F1 score increased from 0.84 with the baseline model to 0.95 after personalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that personalized models consistently outperform the baseline in recognizing stress patterns, validating the effectiveness of this approach. This not only highlights the potential of machine learning and wearable sensors in personalized health monitoring but also establishes a foundation for future real-time stress management applications. Further work will focus on optimizing model performance and integrating the system into real-world scenarios.",10.1109/IMCOM64595.2025.10857507,0,Scopus,85218154937,2-s2.0-85218154937,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218154937

Neural correlates of emotional working memory predict depression and anxiety,Li L.,2025,Frontiers in Neuroscience,"Introduction: Emotional working memory (WM) plays a critical role in cognitive functions such as emotion regulation, decision-making, and learning. Understanding how emotional stimuli, particularly negative ones, affect WM performance is crucial for identifying cognitive markers of mental health issues like anxiety and depression. Our objective is to determine whether trait anxiety and depression levels are associated with specific performance outcomes in emotional WM and whether behavioral and neural indicators demonstrate statistically significant correlations with individual anxiety and depression levels in university students. Methods: In our research: Experiment 1 (n = 25) tested WM performance with both positive and negative emotional stimuli under different cognitive loads (2 vs. 4 items), while Experiment 2 (n = 34) combined EEG recording to investigate the neural index of anxiety and depression during negative emotional WM. Results: Results showed that negative emotional stimuli impaired WM performance, especially under higher cognitive loads, with anxiety level being linked to increased theta activity during encoding and depression level associated with decreased alpha activity during retrieval. Additionally, individuals with higher anxiety exhibited reduced sensitivity to cognitive load differences in WM tasks involving negative emotions. Discussion: These results demonstrated that specific EEG patterns during negative emotional WM were significantly associated with individual anxiety and depression levels, suggesting the potential utility of EEG measures for identifying at-risk individuals of anxiety and depression in university student populations.

The lack of nutritional knowledge and awareness among young people often contributes to this problem. Although previous research has created nutrition applications to help people understand the nutritional value of foods, there is a notable lack of applications expressly designed to help university students in metropolitan Lima manage their caloric intake. To address this gap, we propose Eat4U, an intelligent mobile application aimed at providing students with essential information about the nutritional content, the base model used is Mask R-CNN ResNet50 FPN V2 and the results obtained through finetuning, and incremental learning resulted in a Mean-IoU of 86%, thereby increasing their awareness and understanding of nutrition. The main feature of the application is the use of the cell phone camera and machine learning models equipped with the PyTorch library, allowing users to scan meals and display detailed information on nutrients and calories to manage their caloric intake. Additionally, a personalized recommendation system is offered based on each user's tastes, goals, and objectives, helping them choose healthier food options. The application also includes an interactive log and a calendar of eating habits to monitor progress and encourage the adoption of healthy lifestyles.",10.1109/AICCONF64766.2025.11064276,0,Scopus,105012244765,2-s2.0-105012244765,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012244765
Advancing Mental Health Problems with Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms for Anxiety Classification in Bangladeshi University Students,Ayon S.S.,2025,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"Mental health challenges, particularly anxiety, are a growing concern among university students in Bangladesh, impacting both their well-being and academic performance. This study aims to address this growing issue by developing a robust machine learning model tailored to classify anxiety levels among students. We employed eight well-known machine learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on a customized Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimized Logistic Regression (LR) model. The models were rigorously trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on a newly obtained mental health dataset that had never been investigated with such advanced approaches. This dataset contains information on 1,977 students from 15 of Bangladesh’s leading universities and was thoroughly examined by five academics with 10 to 20 years of experience in academia and research. Our findings indicate that classic models, such as the Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier, attained accuracies of 92.68% and 96.72%, respectively. However, our proposed GA-based LR model succeeded them all, not only in accuracy but also in precision, recall, and F1-score, with an impressive 99.49% accuracy. The study also identified key anxiety-inducing factors, such as academic pressure and worry about academic affairs, providing valuable insights for targeted mental health interventions. These findings indicate the effectiveness of our customized GA-based ML model in enhancing mental health evaluations by identifying the fundamental causes of anxiety, providing vital insights to help Bangladeshi university students maintain their mental health.",10.1007/978-981-96-3294-7_26,0,Scopus,105002465910,2-s2.0-105002465910,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002465910
Artificial Intelligence and Predictive Analytics for Building Multi-dimensional Psychological Evaluation Models to Address Employment Stressors in College Students,Qin C.,2025,Learning and Analytics in Intelligent Systems,"Stress, a common phenomenon among students, especially college students, is worsened by part-time working and studying.

"Needs and Preferences of Swedish Young Adults for a Digital App Promoting Mental Health Literacy, Occupational Balance, and Peer Support: Qualitative Interview Study",Bäckström M.K.,2025,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Young adults experience stressors in their transition to adulthood and are at increased risk of mental ill-health. This risk is compounded by young adults’ low levels of mental health literacy and limited competencies in implementing strategies promoting mental health and well-being in their daily lives. Previous research suggests that digital mental health apps may be particularly effective in increasing the mental health literacy of young adults. In Sweden, there is a lack of research on young adults’ unique perspectives on what constitutes mental health, well-being, and ill-health—perspectives that could inform the coproduction of evidence-based interventions targeting these issues. Objective: The overarching aim of this study was to conduct a needs assessment as part of coproducing a digital mental health app for Swedish young adults. More specifically, the study addressed two research questions: (1) What do Swedish young adults perceive as contributing to the mental health, well-being, and ill-health of themselves and their peers? (2) What are Swedish young adults’ preferences and ideas on how a digital mental health app can support their mental health during young adulthood, including their perspectives on the app’s usability? Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 16 young adults and analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Of the 16 study participants, 9 (56%) identified as women and 7 (44%) as men. Their mean age was 23.6 (SD 4.22; range 18-29) years. Furthermore, 56% (9/16) were pursuing or had obtained a higher education degree, while 44% (7/16) had completed or were in the process of completing a high school diploma. The interviews and subsequent analysis revealed three main themes: (1) “To feel that life is worth living”—pathways through pressures and pursuit of mental well-being during young adulthood, (2) “A personal space for working on one’s own mental well-being”—digital companionship with others, and (3) “Something that is designed for me”—customizing one’s digital mental health journey. Conclusions: In line with the preferences of Swedish young adults, the promotion of mental health and well-being through digital technology and eHealth should focus on a customizable app that supports balance in daily life while strengthening mental health competencies. The content should center on fostering and maintaining meaningful relationships and activities, addressing challenges such as negative social media use and stress recovery, and enhancing mental health knowledge and peer support. Future efforts should focus on researching young adults’ experiences of the life phase of emerging adulthood and its implications for mental health. In addition, future technical development and research on digital mental health apps should include the perspectives of stakeholders, such as mental health professionals, and involve prototype testing with diverse groups to ensure the app’s relevance, user engagement, and effectiveness.",10.2196/71563,1,Scopus,105006647985,2-s2.0-105006647985,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006647985
The Research on Ideological and Political Construction Based on Intelligent Algorithm in College Students' Mental Health Education,Wang C.,2025,International Journal of High Speed Electronics and Systems,"The students with mental health problems often have no spirit to do anything, and serious students will also suffer from depression or split personality. Therefore, we must take corresponding measures to find students with problems in time. Artificial intelligence has a great impact on ideological and political courses, and how to make intelligent algorithms play an active role in the course will be an important topic worth our research. The model constructed in this paper is mainly divided into two parts, one is the online learning scenario based on intelligent algorithm, and the other is the mental health monitoring model of college students. The online learning scenario provides data support for subsequent analysis, which can recommend appropriate courses for users based on users' needs. In the psychoanalysis model, the clustering algorithm is introduced to mine the students' online learning behavior characteristics, and then the students' mental health is analyzed. Finally, the results show that the indicators of online learning scenarios meet the actual needs, which can provide reliable data for subsequent studies. At the same time, the students' online learning situation is significantly related to their mental health, we can monitor the students' psychological state in real time through the learning situation, so as to correct the students with problems in time.",10.1142/S0129156425402724,1,Scopus,85215591567,2-s2.0-85215591567,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215591567
A Deep Learning Model for Psychological Support in Student Entrepreneurship,Yang T.,2025,IEEE Access,"The rise in entrepreneurial endeavours has brought attention to college students’ mental health issues, and developing an accurate assessment tool for them has become a key area of study. The paper proposes the fully embedded bi-order network (FE-BiON) model, a deep learning-based mental health evaluation tool that may be used to evaluate the mental health of college students launching their own businesses. The model innovatively combines fully embedded feature engineering and high-low order parallel network structure, thus improving the recognition ability and evaluation accuracy of psychological characteristics. In order to verify the validity of the model, this paper uses three datasets: The national health and nutrition inspection survey in the United States, the national health and nutrition inspection survey in South Korea, and the behavioral risk factor monitoring system for testing and comparative experiments. The findings demonstrate that in three public datasets, the accuracy and F1 value of the FE-BiON model reach as high as 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, outperforming other comparator models and demonstrating greater prediction performance. The results of ablation experiment further prove that the synergistic effect of high-low order networks and the fully embedded feature processing method have played a significant role in capturing the complex relationship between features and improving the prediction performance of the model. The suggested FE-BiON model performs better in mental health prediction, as evidenced by its accuracy of over 90% in all mental health levels on the assessment of college students’ mental health. The research results provide scientific basis for the development of entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities, theoretical support for the formulation of mental health intervention measures, and practical guidance for improving the success rate of college students’ entrepreneurship, which has important educational and policy influence.",10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3547833,0,Scopus,86000751485,2-s2.0-86000751485,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000751485
The development of a World Health Organization transdiagnostic chatbot intervention for distressed adolescents and young adults,Keyan D.,2025,Frontiers in Digital Health,"Background: Common mental disorders are prevalent in young people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Digitally delivered interventions have the potential to overcome many structural and psychosocial barriers to mental health care. Chatbots have been proposed as one potentially acceptable and feasible method that may increase engagement. Yet, there is currently limited evidence for their efficacy in reducing psychological distress. This paper summarises the development of a World Health Organization digital psychological intervention for young people experiencing impairing psychological distress, developed in line with Human Centred Design (HCD) principles. Objective: This study refined and adapted a chatbot intervention initially developed for adolescents aged 15–18 years that was completed in consultation with end-users in this age group (N = 236), community members (N = 73), and psychology intervention experts (N = 9) across varied settings. The purpose was to create an adaptation fit for use by young adults aged 18–21 years experiencing psychological distress in Jordan. Methods: The current study followed a limited user-centred design process involving focus groups and key informant interviews with stakeholders including young adults aged 18–21 years (N = 33), community members (N = 13), and psychology intervention experts (N = 11). Iterative design development occurred throughout the cultural adaptation and refinement process. Results: There was a clear preference for a chatbot based intervention that included interactions with fictional characters with relatable problems. The chatbot content followed a transdiagnostic model that addressed common problems including low mood, stress and anger with reference to vocational, familial and interpersonal stressors that the target population commonly faced. It followed a non-AI decision tree format with multiple sessions and was designed to be adaptable for use in different countries with different populations and software systems. Prototype versions of the chatbot were well-received by adolescents (15–18-year-old) and young adults (18–21-year-old). Conclusions: This is the first report of the development of a chatbot intervention for adolescents and young adults in LMICs that was designed using a HCD framework. Systematic end-user engagement through all phases of the research aimed to make this intervention acceptable and useable for adolescents and young adults in a wide variety of settings. The chatbot is currently being tested in randomised controlled trials in Jordan and Lithuania.",10.3389/fdgth.2025.1528580,1,Scopus,105007442405,2-s2.0-105007442405,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007442405
Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence to Predict Internet Addiction in Turkish University Students,Gezgin D.M.,2025,International Journal of Human Computer Interaction,"The rising incidence of internet addiction (IA) among university students has raised concerns about its impact on academic performance, mental health, and social relationships. This study aims to model internet addiction in 1,180 university students using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, including SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Unlike traditional statistical approaches, such as linear regression, and opaque AI models like deep neural networks, XAI offers interpretable outputs that help reveal underlying factors contributing to IA. Student demographics, internet use patterns, and psychological variables were analyzed by machine learning algorithms, and SHAP was used to interpret the models. The findings reveal key predictors of IA, such as fear of missing out (FoMO), social anxiety, and social-emotional loneliness. By using XAI, the study shows how specific traits and behaviors elevate IA risk and offers actionable insights for educators and policymakers. It also supports early detection and intervention strategies in educational and psychological contexts.",10.1080/10447318.2025.2526587,1,Scopus,105010943569,2-s2.0-105010943569,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010943569
Mental and Behavioral Factors Associated With Food Addiction Among University Students: A Bangladeshi Study,Das P.,2025,Perspectives in Psychiatric Care,"Background: Food addiction, characterized by the compulsive consumption of highly palatable foods, poses significant health risks, particularly among university students. This study investigates the prevalence of food addiction among Bangladeshi university students and its associations with mental health (depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia) and behavioral factors (smoking, drug, alcohol use, and pornography consumption). Machine learning (ML) models were applied to enhance predictive accuracy. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1697 participants across two Bangladeshi universities. Food addiction was assessed using the Modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS 2.0). Associations were examined using logistic regression and subgroup analyses by gender. Six ML models—K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), XGBoost, and CatBoost—were employed to improve classification performance. Results: Overall, 13% of students met the criteria for food addiction, with higher prevalence among males (14.8%) than females (10.4%). In adjusted models, anxiety (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.43–4.16), stress (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.18–2.58), and pornography use (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.12–2.69) were significant predictors. Subgroup analyses showed that anxiety, stress, and pornography use were significant predictors only among males. Among ML models, KNN achieved the highest accuracy (85.3%), while RF demonstrated the best AUC-ROC (0.697), confirming their utility in identifying at-risk individuals. Conclusions: Food addiction affects a notable proportion of Bangladeshi university students and is strongly linked with anxiety, stress, and pornography use, particularly among males. Interventions should include cognitive-behavioral therapy and stress management programs, digital hygiene education, and nutritional counseling tailored to student populations. ML-based predictive models, such as RF and CatBoost, may be integrated into campus health systems to support early identification and personalized interventions.",10.1155/ppc/8308389,0,Scopus,105019355693,2-s2.0-105019355693,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019355693
Development and validation of the conversational AI dependence scale for Chinese college students,Chen Y.,2025,Frontiers in Psychology,"Excessive dependence on Conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) can significantly impact individual adaptation and development. Given the growing need for empirical assessment, this study presents the development and psychometric validation of the CAI Dependence Scale (CAIDS), a new instrument designed to assess CAI dependence among Chinese college students. In Study 1, drawing on theories of problematic internet use (PIU) and qualitative interviews, we identified the psychological connotations and dimensions of CAI dependence. Item and exploratory factor analyses led to the development of the 20-item CAIDS, comprising four dimensions: uncontrollability, withdrawal symptoms, mood modification, and negative impacts. In Study 2, confirmatory factor analysis in a new sample validated the four-dimensional structure and demonstrated good reliability and validity. In Study 3, a current status survey revealed that the overall level of CAI dependence among college students was relatively high, with significant differences observed by gender, age, grade, income, and region. CAI dependence was a significant positive predictor of negative psychological outcomes and a significant negative predictor of subjective wellbeing. Withdrawal symptoms and negative impacts were more closely related to maladaptive indicators. The CAIDS provides a reliable and valid psychometric tool for assessing CAI dependence; additionally, further validation is required with more diverse samples and in cross-cultural contexts.",10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1621540,0,Scopus,105013468119,2-s2.0-105013468119,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013468119
A Computational CNN-LSTM-Based Mental Health Consultation System in a College Environment,Pan L.,2025,Informatica Slovenia,"In recent years, the mental health problems of college students have gradually attracted significant attention. Increasing academic pressure, employment competition, social adaptation challenges, and other stressors have led to a rise in mental health issues among college students, including anxiety, depression, and social disorders. These problems adversely affect students' academic performance, with long-term negative implications for their future career development. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated psychological stress through isolation measures, distance learning, and social restrictions, highlighting the limitations of traditional mental health service models. In this study, we constructed a deep learning-based mental health counseling system tailored for college students. Utilizing a dataset of 467 valid questionnaires combined with students' behavioral data—such as library study time, internet usage habits, exercise frequency, and canteen consumption records—we employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze and predict students' mental health statuses. Additionally, natural language processing (NLP) techniques were integrated to provide personalized psychological support and interventions. The combined CNN-LSTM model achieved an overall accuracy of 85.7%, a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.041, and an F1 score of 85.2%, demonstrating high precision in identifying and predicting various mental states, including anxiety and depression. Furthermore, trend analysis over six months revealed significant insights into the dynamics of students' mental health, such as increasing stress and declining emotional stability towards the end of the semester. User feedback indicated an 82.6% satisfaction rate with the system's professional content and 80.1% with emotional support, while 77.5% expressed overall satisfaction. These results confirm that the proposed system effectively enhances mental health monitoring and intervention, providing robust technical support for college mental health services and offering a scalable solution for large-scale applications.",10.31449/inf.v49i10.7136,1,Scopus,85219386006,2-s2.0-85219386006,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219386006

Predicting and Understanding College Student Mental Health with Interpretable Machine Learning,Roy Chowdhury M.,2025,Proceedings 2025 IEEE ACM International Conference on Connected Health Applications Systems and Engineering Technologies Chase 2025,"Mental health issues among college students have reached critical levels, affecting both academic performance and overall wellbeing. Predicting and understanding mental health status among college students is challenging due to three key barriers: the lack of large-scale longitudinal datasets, the prevalence of black-box machine learning models that offer little transparency, and a reliance on population-level analysis rather than personalized understanding.To tackle these challenges, this paper presents I-HOPE, the first Interpretable Hierarchical mOdel for Personalized mEntal health prediction. I-HOPE is a two-stage hierarchical model that connects raw behavioral features to mental health status through five defined behavioral categories as interaction labels. We evaluate I-HOPE on the College Experience Study, the longest longitudinal mobile sensing dataset. This dataset spans five years and captures data from both pre-pandemic periods and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Impact of Conversational and Animation Features of a Mental Health App Virtual Agent on Depressive Symptoms and User Experience Among College Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,Six S.,2025,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Numerous mental health apps purport to alleviate depressive symptoms. Strong evidence suggests that brief cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-based mental health apps can decrease depressive symptoms, yet there is limited research elucidating the specific features that may augment its therapeutic benefits. One potential design feature that may influence effectiveness and user experience is the inclusion of virtual agents that can mimic realistic, human face-to-face interactions. Objective: The goal of the current experiment was to determine the effect of conversational and animation features of a virtual agent within a bCBT-based mental health app on depressive symptoms and user experience in college students with and without depressive symptoms. Methods: College students (N=209) completed a 2-week intervention in which they engaged with a bCBT-based mental health app with a customizable therapeutic virtual agent that varied in conversational and animation features. A 2 (time: baseline vs 2-week follow-up) × 2 (conversational vs non-conversational agent) × 2 (animated vs non-animated agent) randomized controlled trial was used to assess mental health symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8, Perceived Stress Scale-10, and Response Rumination Scale questionnaires) and user experience (mHealth App Usability Questionnaire, MAUQ) in college students with and without current depressive symptoms. The mental health app usability and qualitative questions regarding users’ perceptions of their therapeutic virtual agent interactions and customization process were assessed at follow-up. Results: Mixed ANOVA (analysis of variance) results demonstrated a significant decrease in symptoms of depression (P=.002; mean [SD]=5.5 [4.86] at follow-up vs mean [SD]=6.35 [4.71] at baseline), stress (P=.005; mean [SD]=15.91 [7.67] at follow-up vs mean [SD]=17.02 [6.81] at baseline), and rumination (P=.03; mean [SD]=40.42 [12.96] at follow-up vs mean [SD]=41.92 [13.61] at baseline); however, no significant effect of conversation or animation was observed. Findings also indicate a significant increase in user experience in animated conditions. This significant increase in animated conditions is also reflected in the user’s ease of use and satisfaction (F(1, 201)=102.60, P<.001), system information arrangement (F(1, 201)=123.12, P<.001), and usefulness of the application (F(1, 201)=3667.62, P<.001). Conclusions: The current experiment provides support for bCBT-based mental health apps featuring customizable, humanlike therapeutic virtual agents and their ability to significantly reduce negative symptomology over a brief timeframe. The app intervention reduced mental health symptoms, regardless of whether the agent included conversational or animation features, but animation features enhanced the user experience. These effects were observed in both users with and without depressive symptoms.",10.2196/67381,0,Scopus,105003736792,2-s2.0-105003736792,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003736792
Intelligent System for Mood and Depression Detection and Analysis,Aswal Krishna P.,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 11th International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing Iccsp 2025,"The rising prevalence of mental health conditions, primarily depression, has become a critical issue affecting millions of people worldwide, especially college students, and involving the fundamental emotional, psychological, and social derangements of the said condition. Early detection of health is essential for immediate intervention; however, conventional methods of diagnosis require self-reporting and clinical judgment, which frequently delay the identification of susceptible individuals. This paper discusses the development of a technology-led innovation for the assessment of depression or mental health disorders. Based on machine learning algorithms and NLP, the proposed system investigates linguistic patterns, sentiment, and behavioral indicators in user interactions via digital platforms. With users' reports and other environmental factors, this proposed system allows users to have a non-intrusive, scalable, and efficient means of possibly determining depressive tendencies. When this tool is associated with related services for mental health support, one can anticipate that recommendations, resources, and access to professionals are given to every user. This seeks to close gaps in accessing mental health care, with which early recognition, minimal stigma, and proactive support for mental wellness are maximally enhanced.",10.1109/ICCSP64183.2025.11088514,0,Scopus,105013458992,2-s2.0-105013458992,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013458992
The Application of Data Mining in Dynamic Monitoring of Mental Health Trends Among College Students,Wei X.,2025,International Journal of Healthcare Information Systems and Informatics,"Monitoring mental health trends among college students is essential for campus healthcare. Traditional methods often lack data coverage and timely detection, limiting intervention effectiveness. This study proposes a dynamic monitoring framework using advanced data mining to identify at-risk students through multi-source data—academic records, online behavior, and psychological surveys. The framework integrates clustering analysis (improved GMM-HDBSCAN), association rule mining, and deep learning-based forecasting (Attention-LSTM). Empirical analysis of three years of data shows 92.7% accuracy in detecting risk groups, with dynamic graph neural networks identifying key influencers in sentiment spread. Results indicate that data mining improves accuracy and timeliness in mental health monitoring. Challenges remain in data integration, model interpretability, and student privacy.

Methods and Implementation Paths for Evaluating the Impact of Deep Learning Based on Big Data on Ideological and Political Education and Mental Health of College Students,Xing R.,2025,International Journal of High Speed Electronics and Systems,"In the process of evaluating the learning effect of college students’ civic politics and mental health courses, there is a strong nonlinear relationship between the data involved, which leads to the problems of poor data fitting ability, low accuracy and stability of learning effect evaluation, so we propose a method for evaluating the in-depth learning effect of college students’ civic politics and mental health courses based on big data. Based on the online learning platform and LMS learning management system, students’ learning behavior data are extracted; the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function is used to fill in the missing values of the extracted data and extract the data feature values; the hierarchical analysis method is used to comprehensively analyze the learning behavior data and the corresponding feature information, construct the evaluation system of in-depth learning effect, and obtain the evaluation indexes of in-depth learning effect of Civic and Political Science and Mental Health Courses; using the 9-point comparison scale and expert scoring method, we assign scores to the degree of importance of the evaluation index data, calculate the corresponding weight coefficients of the indexes, and reduce the impact of data nonlinearity on the final evaluation results; based on the big data method, we introduce momentum on the basis of BP neural network topology, and apply the improved BP neural network algorithm to perform the steps of initialization of the network weights and learning parameters, forward propagation of the inputs, backward propagation of the error, and iterative iterations to realize the evaluation of college students’ civic politics and mental health. Steps to realize the evaluation of in-depth learning effect of college students’ civic politics and mental health courses are provided. The experimental results show that using the design method for deep learning effect evaluation, the data prediction accuracy is high, and the maximum difference is no more than 0.34. Moreover, under the situation of different data volume, the output model network training value and the actual students’ deep learning effect evaluation value have a high degree of fit, and the highest value of positive residual fluctuation is only 0.34, and the negative residual fluctuation is −0.18, with the value of G being 0.972, and the value of F1 being 0.986, which has a good performance of 0.972, and the value of F1 being 0.986.

Exploring Online Health Information–Seeking Behavior Among Young Adults: Scoping Review,Stifjell K.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The ability to access and evaluate online health information is essential for young adults to manage their physical and mental well-being. With the growing integration of the internet, mobile technology, and social media, young adults (aged 18-30 years) are increasingly turning to digital platforms for health-related content. Despite this trend, there remains a lack of systematic insights into their specific behaviors, preferences, and needs when seeking health information online. Objective: This scoping review aims to understand “What previous studies report regarding young adults’ online health information–seeking behavior (OHISB) for health information in terms of the choice of digital platform and platform user interface (UI)?” It attempts to (1) determine which digital platforms young adults tend to use to search for health information and (2) identify characteristics in the UI that apply to young adults’ aims and trust. Methods: A literature search was conducted in February 2024 across Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. The final search identified 4634 publications, with 912 publications screened after removing duplicates. Of these, 32 articles met the inclusion criteria. Qualitative content analysis was used to extract themes related to young adults’ OHISB. Studies were selected using predefined eligibility criteria, and data were charted in a structured matrix. Charted data were coded manually and analyzed thematically following the 6-phase framework of Braun and Clarke to identify recurring patterns across the studies. This process was embedded within the Arksey and O’Malley framework for scoping reviews. Results: The findings showed that young adults primarily use search engines and social media, with information drawn from 5 types of internet-based sources. Six key platform characteristics were found to influence their engagement: credible content, user-friendly design, tailored language, interactive features, privacy, and inclusivity. Conclusions: Although young adults are active digital health seekers, the current literature does not adequately capture their evolving behaviors. Many studies lacked details on how specific platform affordances influence trust and usability. This review highlights the need for more targeted research on how to design platforms and provides information on how digital context affects online health seeking and decision-making. Given the rapid changes in technologies and information environments, future research should explore their interactions with emerging tools, such as artificial intelligence; address the needs of those in vulnerable situations; and support health literacy in online contexts. An improved understanding of UI preferences and platform behaviors can inform more inclusive, youth-centered digital health interventions.",10.2196/70379,0,Scopus,105015305258,2-s2.0-105015305258,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015305258
Feasibility and Usability of an Artificial Intelligence—Powered Gamification Intervention for Enhancing Physical Activity Among College Students: Quasi-Experimental Study,Gao Y.,2025,Jmir Serious Games,"Background: Physical activity (PA) is vital for physical and mental health, but many college students fail to meet recommended levels. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered gamification interventions through mobile app have the potential to improve PA levels among Chinese college students. Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and usability of an AI-powered gamification intervention. Methods: A quasi-experimental study spanning 2 months was conducted on a sample of college students aged 18 to 25 years old from 18 universities in Beijing. PA data were recorded using the ShouTi Fitness app, and participant engagement was evaluated through surveys. User satisfaction was gauged through the System Usability Scale, while the intervention’s feasibility was assessed through Spearman rank correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney tests, and additional descriptive analyses. Results: As of July 2023, we enrolled 456 college students. In total, 18,073 PA sessions were recorded, with men completing 8068 sessions and women completing 10,055 sessions. The average PA intensity was 7 metabolic equivalent of energy (MET)s per session. Most participants preferred afternoon sessions and favored short-duration sessions, with men averaging 66 seconds per session and women 42 seconds. The System Usability Scale score for the intervention based on app is 65.2. Users responded positively to the integration of AI and gamification elements, including personalized recommendations, action recognition, smart grouping, dynamic management, collaborative, and competition. Specifically, 341 users (75%) found the AI features very interesting, 365 (80%) were motivated by the gamification elements, 364 (80%) reported that the intervention supported their fitness goals, and 365 (80%) considered the intervention reliable. A significant positive correlation was observed between the duration of individual PA and intervention duration for men (ρ=0.510, P<.001), although the correlation was weaker for women (ρ=0.258, P=.046). However, the frequency of PA declined after 35 days. Conclusions: This study provides pioneering evidence of the feasibility and usability of the AI-powered gamification intervention. While adherence was successfully demonstrated, further studies or interventions are needed to directly assess the impact on PA levels and focus on optimizing long-term adherence strategies and evaluating health outcomes.",10.2196/65498,4,Scopus,105003069603,2-s2.0-105003069603,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003069603
Unmasking the silent threat: understanding cybercrimes targeting female students of Kashmir university—a mixed-method analysis,Yaqoob S.S.,2025,Journal of Cybersecurity,"Technological advancements of the 20th century have not only expanded women’s access to information and virtual interaction but have also contributed to a rise in cybercrimes. Cybercrime involves intentional and often repeated aggressive behaviour enacted through digital technologies to inflict psychological, emotional, or social harm on individuals or groups. These acts are frequently amplified by power imbalances and the persistent, far-reaching nature of online platforms. Female users, often perceived as more vulnerable by legal and societal systems, face disproportionately higher risks of cyber victimization. Such offences can lead to severe physical, sexual, psychological, and economic consequences. This study explores the nature and impact of cybercrimes experienced by female university students in Kashmir. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research collected quantitative data from 250 female students, of whom 15 were selected for qualitative interviews. Although the prevalence of cybercrimes in the region is not alarmingly high, the lack of computer literacy, limited awareness of cyber laws, and minimal digital protection mechanisms increase women’s vulnerability to online threats. The psychological consequences of cybercrime were profound, manifesting in depression, anxiety, and withdrawal from digital spaces. The study underscores the urgent need to enhance cyber safety education, legal protections, and support systems to safeguard female users in the region’s digital landscape. This study highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to bolster cyber literacy and resilience among female university students in Kashmir. By fostering digital safety awareness and strengthening institutional support systems, stakeholders can create a safer online environment, empowering women to engage confidently in the digital sphere without fear of exploitation or harm.",10.1093/cybsec/tyaf026,0,Scopus,105018095404,2-s2.0-105018095404,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018095404
"A Comparative Analysis of Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Algorithm in Data Analysis of College Students' Psychological Health",Li Q.,2025,Informatica Slovenia,"To solve the problem of identifying the mental health status of college students, this study investigated the psychological conditions of students in a certain department of a university in Hubei Province through a questionnaire survey using the SCL - 90 scale. It combined machine learning algorithms to analyze the applicability of the model and explore the differences between students with healthy and sub - healthy mental states. Data (including basic information) of 500 students were randomly collected. A self - compiled questionnaire was used in combination with on - site scoring by psychological teachers to classify the mental states of the 500 students into healthy and sub - healthy states. Questionnaire data were analyzed through decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, and XGBOOST algorithms to quickly identify the healthy and sub - healthy states and to mine the behavioral characteristics that have a certain correlation with the mental health status of students. The data information of 500 students was modeled respectively, and the classification effects of the models were evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, F1 - score, and AUC. The results showed that among the four methods, the random forest had the best classification effect, with an R2 score of 0.8891, which was higher than the R2 score of 0.8393 for the decision tree, the R2 score of 0.8840 for the support vector machine, and the R2 score of 0.8618 for the XGBOOST algorithm. Considering the advantages of the random forest in terms of classification performance, modeling time, interpretability, feature selection, and simplicity, we recommend using the random forest model to assist in the diagnosis of mental health status classification. The experimental results on the SCL - 90 scale survey and the student basic information dataset show that the proposed model has high accuracy and can converge quickly, enabling more effective and accurate prediction of students' mental health status.",10.31449/inf.v49i15.7004,4,Scopus,105000029145,2-s2.0-105000029145,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000029145

"Machine-learning detection of stress severity expressed on a continuous scale using acoustic, verbal, visual, and physiological data: lessons learned",Ciharova M.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Early detection of elevated acute stress is necessary if we aim to reduce consequences associated with prolonged or recurrent stress exposure. Stress monitoring may be supported by valid and reliable machine-learning algorithms. However, investigation of algorithms detecting stress severity on a continuous scale is missing due to high demands on data quality for such analyses. Use of multimodal data, meaning data coming from multiple sources, might contribute to machine-learning stress severity detection. We aimed to detect laboratory-induced stress using multimodal data and identify challenges researchers may encounter when conducting a similar study. Methods: We conducted a preliminary exploration of performance of a machine-learning algorithm trained on multimodal data, namely visual, acoustic, verbal, and physiological features, in its ability to detect stress severity following a partially automated online version of the Trier Social Stress Test. College students (n = 42; M age = 20.79, 69% female) completed a self-reported stress visual analogue scale at five time-points: After the initial resting period (P1), during the three stress-inducing tasks (i.e., preparation for a presentation, a presentation task, and an arithmetic task, P2-4) and after a recovery period (P5). For the whole duration of the experiment, we recorded the participants’ voice and facial expressions by a video camera and measured cardiovascular and electrodermal physiology by an ambulatory monitoring system. Then, we evaluated the performance of the algorithm in detection of stress severity using 3 combinations of visual, acoustic, verbal, and physiological data collected at each of the periods of the experiment (P1-5). Results: Participants reported minimal (P1, M = 21.79, SD = 17.45) to moderate stress severity (P2, M = 47.95, SD = 15.92), depending on the period at hand. We found a very weak association between the detected and observed scores (r<sup>2</sup> =.154; p =.021). In our post-hoc analysis, we classified participants into categories of stressed and non-stressed individuals. When applying all available features (i.e., visual, acoustic, verbal, and physiological), or a combination of visual, acoustic and verbal features, performance ranged from acceptable to good, but only for the presentation task (accuracy up to.71, F1-score up to.73). Conclusions: The complexity of input features needed for machine-learning detection of stress severity based on multimodal data requires large sample sizes with wide variability of stress reactions and inputs among participants. These are difficult to recruit for laboratory setting, due to high time and effort demands on the side of both researcher and participant. Resources needed may be decreased using automatization of experimental procedures, which may, however, lead to additional technological challenges, potentially causing other recruitment setbacks. Further investigation is necessary, with the emphasis on quality ground truth, i.e., gold standard (self-report) instruments, but also outside of laboratory experiments, mainly in general populations and mental health care patients.",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1548287,0,Scopus,105009527576,2-s2.0-105009527576,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009527576
Perceptions of artificial intelligence among university students.

Writing or speaking: A quantitative survey of communication modes with conversational agents to promote mental health among young adults in Germany,Lukas C.,2025,I Com,"Young adults frequently face mental health challenges due to high expectations, self-doubt, and uncertainties about the future. With advancements in digital communication, artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational agents (CAs) could play a role for those struggling with grief, anxiety or loneliness. This study investigates the current use of CAs (e. g. ChatGPT, Siri) for mental health purposes and the preferred communication modes among young adults in Germany. A quantitative online survey was conducted from August 6 to September 17, 2023, involving 216 participants aged 18 to 27 (120 females, 95 males, 1 non-binary). The findings reveal that 82â€¯% of respondents use CAs, with 17â€¯% having asked help from these agents when feeling depressed or anxious. While verbal communication is preferred for sharing grief with humans, written interaction is favoured when engaging with CAs. Notably, participants with preexisting anxiety or psychological distress showed an increased tendency to communicate about it and a stronger preference for writing about their concerns. These findings suggest that CAs could be a valuable tool for mental health support, especially for young male adults who may be less inclined to openly share their concerns. Further exploration is needed to understand the evolving role of CAs in mental health support, particularly in how to interact with them effectively.",10.1515/icom-2025-0001,0,Scopus,105011325416,2-s2.0-105011325416,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105011325416

The Effect of Predicted Compliance With a Web-Based Intervention for Anxiety and Depression Among Latin American University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,Benjet C.,2025,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (wb-CBT) is a scalable way to reach distressed university students. Guided wb-CBT is typically superior to self-guided wb-CBT over short follow-up periods, but evidence is less clear over longer periods. Objective: This study aimed to compare short-term (3 months) and longer-term (12 months) aggregate effects of guided and self-guided wb-CBT versus treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized controlled trial of Colombian and Mexican university students and carry out an initially unplanned secondary analysis of the role of differential predicted compliance in explaining these differences. Methods: The 1319 participants, recruited either through email and social media outreach invitations or from waiting lists of campus mental health clinics, were undergraduates (1038/1319, 78.7% female) with clinically significant baseline anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 score≥10) or depression (Patient Health Questionnaire–9 score≥10). The intervention arms comprised guided wb-CBT with weekly asynchronous written human feedback, self-guided wb-CBT with the same content as the guided modality, and TAU as provided at each university. The prespecified primary outcome was joint remission (Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 score=0-4 and Patient Health Questionnaire–9 score=0-4). The secondary outcome was joint symptom reduction (mean scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale) at 3 and 12 months after randomization. Results: As reported previously, 3-month outcomes were significantly better with guided wb-CBT than self-guided wb-CBT (P=.02) or TAU (P=.02). However, subsequent follow-up showed that 12-month joint remission (adjusted risk differences=6.0-6.5, SE 0.4-0.5, and P<.001 to P=.007; adjusted mean differences=2.70-2.69, SE 0.7-0.8, and P<.001 to P=.001) was significantly better with self-guided wb-CBT than with the other interventions. Participants randomly assigned to the guided wb-CBT arm spent twice as many minutes logged on as those in the self-guided wb-CBT arm in the first 12 weeks (mean 12.5, SD 36.9 vs 5.9, SD 27.7; χ<sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf>=107.1, P<.001), whereas participants in the self-guided wb-CBT arm spent twice as many minutes logged on as those in the guided wb-CBT arm in weeks 13 to 52 (mean 0.4, SD 7.5 vs 0.2, SD 4.4; χ<sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf>=10.5, P=.001). Subgroup analysis showed that this longer-term superiority of self-guided wb-CBT was confined to the 40% (528/1319) of participants with high predicted self-guided wb-CBT compliance beyond 3 months based on a counterfactual nested cross-validated machine learning model. The 12-month outcome differences were nonsignificant across arms among other participants (all P>.05). Conclusions: The results have important practical implications for precision intervention targeting to maximize longer-term wb-CBT benefits. Future research needs to investigate strategies to increase sustained guided wb-CBT use once guidance ends.",10.2196/64251,1,Scopus,105001244362,2-s2.0-105001244362,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001244362
Predicting Daily Depression Scores Using Passive Sensing: A Behaviour-Aware Approach to Missing Value Handling,Corbett S.,2025,Proceedings 2025 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing Smartcomp 2025,"Depression is a serious mental health issue among college students, yet early detection and continuous monitoring remain challenging due to reliance on infrequent and subjective self-reports. Recent developments in mobile and wearable sensor technologies provide a promising alternative by using passive, real-time monitoring of behavioural patterns. However, such data are often missing, and traditional imputation methods typically assume data are missing (completely) at random. In this study, we introduced a sensor-aware preprocessing pipeline that adjusts specific missing values when the absence of data may reflect meaningful user behaviour rather than sensor failure. The pipeline is applied to longitudinal mobile sensing data and weekly Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) depression scores from college students over three academic years. By interpolating PHQ-4 scores to generate daily labels, we train and evaluate regression models to predict depression scores. Our sensor-aware adjustment approach improved model performance compared to standard preprocessing methods. These findings show the value of including contextual knowledge in missing data handling and support the feasibility of passive, continuous mental health monitoring in student populations.",10.1109/SMARTCOMP65954.2025.00077,0,Scopus,105010833074,2-s2.0-105010833074,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010833074

Development and Evaluation of a Mental Health Chatbot Using ChatGPT 4.0: Mixed Methods User Experience Study With Korean Users,Kang B.,2025,Jmir Medical Informatics,"Background: Mental health chatbots have emerged as a promising tool for providing accessible and convenient support to individuals in need. Building on our previous research on digital interventions for loneliness and depression among Korean college students, this study addresses the limitations identified and explores more advanced artificial intelligence–driven solutions. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate the performance of HoMemeTown Dr. CareSam, an advanced cross-lingual chatbot using ChatGPT 4.0 (OpenAI) to provide seamless support in both English and Korean contexts. The chatbot was designed to address the need for more personalized and culturally sensitive mental health support identified in our previous work while providing an accessible and user-friendly interface for Korean young adults. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods pilot study with 20 Korean young adults aged 18 to 27 (mean 23.3, SD 1.96) years. The HoMemeTown Dr CareSam chatbot was developed using the GPT application programming interface, incorporating features such as a gratitude journal and risk detection. User satisfaction and chatbot performance were evaluated using quantitative surveys and qualitative feedback, with triangulation used to ensure the validity and robustness of findings through cross-verification of data sources. Comparative analyses were conducted with other large language models chatbots and existing digital therapy tools (Woebot [Woebot Health Inc] and Happify [Twill Inc]). Results: Users generally expressed positive views towards the chatbot, with positivity and support receiving the highest score on a 10-point scale (mean 9.0, SD 1.2), followed by empathy (mean 8.7, SD 1.6) and active listening (mean 8.0, SD 1.8). However, areas for improvement were noted in professionalism (mean 7.0, SD 2.0), complexity of content (mean 7.4, SD 2.0), and personalization (mean 7.4, SD 2.4). The chatbot demonstrated statistically significant performance differences compared with other large language models chatbots (F=3.27; P=.047), with more pronounced differences compared with Woebot and Happify (F=12.94; P<.001). Qualitative feedback highlighted the chatbot’s strengths in providing empathetic responses and a user-friendly interface, while areas for improvement included response speed and the naturalness of Korean language responses. Conclusions: The HoMemeTown Dr CareSam chatbot shows potential as a cross-lingual mental health support tool, achieving high user satisfaction and demonstrating comparative advantages over existing digital interventions.

Graph-Based Network Analysis for Identifying Key Factors of Internet Addiction,Sabah M.,2025,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Internet Addiction (IA) is a repetitive and pathological condition characterized by a strong dependence on a specific substance or behavior. IA has become an increasingly prevalent issue, especially among young people and adolescents. To address this issue, a questionnaire was developed according to the criteria of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to detect addiction cases among university students in Iraq aged 17–24 years. The results of the questionnaire were analyzed using machine learning (ML) algorithms, specifically (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), XGBOOST (XGB)). Graph Network Analysis (GNA) was used to analyze and understand patterns and structures in the data, particularly the correlations between questions and answers in the questionnaire, as in the case of this study. The analysis revealed that six questions had strong correlations and could replace all other questions. Based on the utilized data, the SVM algorithm outperformed all other ML algorithms mentioned above in both scenarios (before and after using GNA). When applied to the original questionnaire, an accuracy of 0.973 was achieved, and when applied to the results of the GNA-based questionnaire, an accuracy of 0.991 was obtained. Overall, the classification results of the five ML algorithms improved by an average of 4.4% when using the results of GNA. The SVM algorithm is superior to other algorithms because it works well in cases of binary classification, where it can find the optimal separation between classes.",10.1007/978-3-031-87076-7_8,0,Scopus,105003636075,2-s2.0-105003636075,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003636075

Validity and Reliability Analysis of the Artificial Intelligence–Digital Life Balance Scale,Erdemir N.,2025,Psychiatric Quarterly,"This study aimed to develop and validate the Artificial Intelligence - Digital Life Balance Scale (AI-DLBS), a psychometric tool designed to assess the multidimensional impact of digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) on individuals’ psychological, social, physical, and academic well-being. Utilizing ChatGPT-4, a novel AI-driven approach, the 40-item scale was constructed to measure five key dimensions: frequency and duration of digital device use, psychological and social effects, physical health impacts, academic performance, and technology access and dependency. Data were collected from three independent samples of university students in Turkey (N = 773, N = 325, N = 86) using convenience sampling. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed a six-factor structure, explaining 60.83% of the variance, with acceptable model fit indices (e.g., RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.90). The scale demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.68-0.87) and test-retest reliability. The AI-DLBS offers significant potential for psychiatric research and clinical practice, enabling mental health professionals to evaluate technology-related risks, such as anxiety, social isolation, and dependency, and design targeted interventions, including digital detox programs. The innovative use of AI in scale development highlights both its efficiency and ethical challenges, such as data bias risks.

"Investigating AI Chatbot Dependence: Associations with Internet and Smartphone Dependence, Mental Health Outcomes, and the Moderating Role of Usage Purposes",Zhang X.,2025,International Journal of Human Computer Interaction,"With the rapid rise of AI chatbots, concerns about AI chatbot dependence are increasing. Prior research has focused primarily on university students, leaving limited understanding of its broader psychological and behavioral implications. This study examined associations between AI chatbot dependence, internet and smartphone dependence, and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and well-being) in a general adult sample (N = 1,146). Usage purposes were also examined as a moderator. AI chatbot dependence was moderately correlated with internet and smartphone dependence, but these associations were weaker than the internet–smartphone link. Positive associations were found between AI chatbot dependence and depression or anxiety, but not with mental well-being. Notably, usage purpose moderated the relationship between chatbot dependence and well-being: individuals using chatbots primarily for information retrieval reported higher well-being. While AI chatbot dependence is positively linked to traditional technology dependence, its association with mental health appears weaker, suggesting a different psychological profile.",10.1080/10447318.2025.2545464,1,Scopus,105013371404,2-s2.0-105013371404,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013371404
"MRI-based machine learning analysis of perivascular spaces and their link to sleep disturbances, dementia, and mental distress in young adults with long-time mobile phone use",Li L.,2025,Frontiers in Neuroscience,"Objective: Long-term mobile phone use (LTMPU) has been linked to sleep disorders, mood disorders, and cognitive impairment, with MRI-detected enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVSs) as potential imaging markers. This study investigated computational MRI-visible EPVSs and their association with sleep disturbance, dementia, and mental distress in young adults with LTMPU. Methods: This retrospective study included 82 LTMPU patients who underwent MRI scans and assessments using six clinical scales: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A), and Hamilton Depression (HAM-D). Deep learning algorithms segmented EPVSs lesions, extracting quantitative metrics (count, volume, mean length, and mean curvature) across 17 brain subregions. Correlation analyses explored relationships between EPVSs indicators and clinical measurements. The BrainNet Viewer tool highlighted significant brain subregions and EPVSs traits linked to dementia, sleep disturbance, and mental distress. Results: Correlation analyses identified 23 significant indicator pairs (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05), including associations between nine EPVSs characteristics and MoCA scores: four with the PSQI, one with the ISI, three with the ESS, four with the HAM-A, and two with the HAM-D. Regression analyses revealed seven significant EPVSs features, with three linked to cognitive impairment: mean EPVSs length in the left basal ganglia and mean length/curvature in the left temporal lobe. Also, the mean EPVSs length in the left frontal lobe could indicate insomnia, sleepiness, and anxiety. Conclusion: Computational EPVSs metrics offer insights into the EPVSs pathophysiology and its links to mood disorders, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment in LTMPU patients.

Youth Expectations and Perceptions of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education,Cotino-Arbelo A.E.,2025,International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a recent innovation, what’s new is how accessible its features have become across multiple devices, apps, and services. Sensationalistic news can distort public perception by exaggerating AI’s capabilities and risks. This leads to misconceptions and unrealistic expectations, causing misunderstandings about the true nature and limitation of these tools. Such distortions can undermine trust and hinder the effective adoption and integration of AI into society. This study aims to address this issue by exploring the expectations and perceptions of young individuals regarding Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools. It explores their understanding of GAI and related devices, such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and social robots, which can incorporate GAI. A total of N=100 university students engaged in this study by completing a digital questionnaire distributed through the virtual campus of the University of La Laguna. The quantitative analysis uncovered a significant gap in participants’ understanding of GAI terminology and its underlying mechanisms. Additionally, it shed light on a noteworthy gender-based discrepancy in the expressed concerns.

Digital Surveillance of Mental Health Care Services in Saudi Arabia: Cross-Sectional Study of National e-Referral System Data,Alharbi A.A.,2025,Jmir Public Health and Surveillance,"Background: Mental illness affects an estimated 25% of the global population, with treatment gaps persisting worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, leading to a significant increase in mental health issues globally. In Saudi Arabia, the lifetime prevalence of mental disorders is estimated at 34.2%, yet 86.1% of those with a 12-month mental disorder report no service use. To address these challenges, digital health solutions, particularly electronic referral (e-referral) systems, have emerged as powerful tools to improve care coordination and access. Saudi Arabia has pioneered the nationwide Saudi Medical Appointments and Referrals Centre (SMARC), a centralized e-referral system using artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. Objectives: This study aims to analyze Saudi Arabia’s novel nationwide e-referral system for mental health services, using SMARC platform data to examine referral patterns, and service accessibility. This study also aims to demonstrate how digital health technology can inform and improve mental health care delivery and policy making. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study used secondary data from SMARC on 10,033 psychiatric e-referrals in Saudi Arabia during 2020‐2021. Referrals were assessed by patient sociodemographic variables, geographic data, and e-referral characteristics including date, type, bed type, and reason for e-referral. Descriptive statistical analyses identified referral patterns, while regression modeling determined predictors of external referrals to other regions. Results: Analysis of 10,033 psychiatric e-referrals revealed that 58.99% (n=5918) were for patients aged 18‐44 years, 63.93% (n=6414) were for men, and 87.10% (n=8739) were for Saudi nationals. The Western Business Unit generated 45.17% (n=4532) of all e-referral requests. Emergency cases were the most common type of referral overall, followed by routine inpatient and routine outpatient department referrals. However, in the Northern Business Unit, routine inpatient referrals were most frequent. Two-thirds of requests were for ward beds, while critical beds were rarely requested. “Unavailable subspecialty” was the primary reason for referrals across all regions. The utilization of the mental health e-referral system varied across regions, with the Northern Border and Albaha regions showing the highest rates, while Madinah, Eastern, and Riyadh regions demonstrated lower use. Temporal analysis showed almost similar monthly patterns in 2020 and 2021. There was an overall increase in referrals in 2021 compared with 2020. Conclusions: This pioneering study of mental health e-referrals in Saudi Arabia demonstrates how digital health transformation, particularly through an e-referral system, has significantly enhanced access to mental health services nationwide in Saudi Arabia. The success of this digital initiative demonstrates how digital health solutions can transform health care access, particularly in mental health services, offering a valuable model for other health care systems.",10.2196/64257,0,Scopus,85216790871,2-s2.0-85216790871,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216790871
“I Believe That AI Will Recognize the Problem Before It Happens”: Qualitative Study Exploring Young Adults’ Perceptions of AI in Mental Health Care,Petersson L.,2025,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Globally, young adults with mental health problems struggle to access appropriate and timely care, which may lead to a poorer future prognosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) is suggested to improve the quality of mental health care through increased capacities in diagnostics, monitoring, access, advanced decision-making, and digital consultations. Within mental health care, the design and application of AI solutions should elucidate the patient perspective on AI. Objective: The aim was to explore the perceptions of AI in mental health care from the viewpoint of young adults with experience of seeking help for common mental health problems. Methods: This was an interview study with 25 young adults aged between 18 and 30 years that applied a qualitative inductive design, with content analysis, to explore how AI-based technology can be used in mental health care. Results: Three categories were derived from the analysis, representing the participants’ perceptions of how AI-based technology can be used in care for mental health problems. The first category entailed perceptions of AI-based technology as a digital companion, supporting individuals at difficult times, reminding and suggesting self-care activities, suggesting sources of information, and generally being receptive to changes in behavior or mood. The second category revolved around AI enabling more effective care and functioning as a tool, both for the patient and health care professionals (HCPs). Young adults expressed confidence in AI to improve triage, screening, identification, and diagnosis. The third category concerned risks and skepticism toward AI as a product developed by humans with limitations. Young adults voiced concerns about security and integrity, and about AI being autonomous, incapable of human empathy but with strong predictive capabilities. Conclusions: Young adults recognize the potential of AI to serve as personalized support and its function as a digital guide and companion between mental health care consultations. It was believed that AI would function as a support in navigating the help-seeking process, ensuring that they avoid the “missing middle” service gap. They also voiced that AI will improve efficiency in health care, through monitoring, diagnostic accuracy, and reduction of the workload of HCPs, while simultaneously reducing the need for young adults to repeatedly tell their stories. Young adults express an ambivalence toward the use of AI in health care and voice risks of data integrity and bias. They consider AI to be more rational and objective than HCPs but do not want to forsake personal interaction with humans. Based on the results of this study and young adults’ perceptions of the monitoring capabilities of AI, future studies should define the boundaries regarding information collection responsibilities of the health care system versus the individuals’ responsibility for self-care.",10.2196/76973,0,Scopus,105015397703,2-s2.0-105015397703,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015397703
Expertise and emotion: how online opinion leaders shape public perceptions of AI—among university students in China,Liu W.,2025,Frontiers in Communication,"The rapid development of AI technology has triggered intense discussions on social media. As key users, online opinion leaders (OILs) wield “emotional power” that exhibits an “emotion setting” effect, influencing users’ perceptions of AI, with their “expert” identity playing a crucial role in emotional communication. To examine the impact of OILs’ expert credibility and emotional arousal level on users’ AI perception, an experimental study (N = 102) was conducted. Results show that under a negative tone, higher-expert-credibility OILs led participants to perceive AI as more useful (PU) and easier to use (PEOU). Similarly, higher emotional arousal strengthened these perceptions. Notably, for high-credibility OILs, the arousal-credibility interaction significantly affected both PEOU and PU, whereas for low-credibility OILs, it impacted PU but not PEOU. Furthermore, AI anxiety mediates the arousal-perception relationship, moderated by expert credibility. Critically, emotional arousal significantly influenced AI anxiety regardless of credibility level. This study elucidates how OILs shape sociotechnical imaginaries amid rapid AI advancement.",10.3389/fcomm.2025.1640957,0,Scopus,105012982067,2-s2.0-105012982067,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012982067

Exploring Learners’ Perceptions of AI-mediated informal digital Multilingual Learning: A Q-Methodology Approach,Guo S.,2025,International Journal of Applied Linguistics United Kingdom,"Despite the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in language learning, little is known about how multilingual learners perceive and engage with AI-mediated informal digital language learning (AI-IDLL). To address this gap, this study adopts the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) framework and employs Q-methodology to investigate 31 Chinese university students learning both English and Japanese. The study identified three factors that influence students’ AI-mediated informal digital learning of English (AI-IDLE): performance-driven motivation, emotion-driven motivation, and the coexistence of quality anxiety and tool dependency. In contrast, two factors influence students’ AI-mediated informal digital learning of Japanese (AI-IDLJ): coexistence of cost concerns and efficiency-driven motivations, and facilitating conditions. By comparing the motivational factors shaping the behavioral intentions in AI-IDLE and AI-IDLJ, this study reveals shared mechanisms and the culture-specific dynamics in multilingual technology acceptance. These findings elucidate the diverse motivational factors influencing language learners in a multilingual context, contributing to theories of AI-IDLL and informing pedagogical approaches in AI-assisted multilingual teaching.",10.1111/ijal.12815,1,Scopus,105011061061,2-s2.0-105011061061,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105011061061
"“Like Someone Is Paying Attention to You, Listening to You, and Guiding You”: Acceptability of a Mental Health Chatbot Among Caregivers of Adolescents Living With HIV",Rupani N.,2025,Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care,"Background: This study assessed the acceptability, among caregivers, of a mental health chatbot designed for adolescents living with HIV aged 10 to 19 years. Methods: Fifteen caregivers interacted with the mental health chatbot. Pre–post assessments and semistructured interviews evaluated acceptability. Data were analyzed using a Framework Analysis approach. Results: Caregivers aged 31 to 70 years found the chatbot acceptable on individual, interpersonal, and environmental levels. They appreciated the educational content and self-help tools, feeling the chatbot would benefit them personally. Caregivers also saw potential in the chatbot to improve communication with their children, particularly during critical periods like HIV diagnosis. Despite concerns about data costs or internet access, most viewed the chatbot as an accessible supplement to traditional mental health services. Conclusion: This study suggests that a mental health chatbot for Peruvian adolescents living with HIV was acceptable to their caregivers, potentially benefiting caregivers’ mental health, enhancing caregiver–adolescent interactions, and fostering better communication.",10.1177/23259582251327911,0,Scopus,105001486551,2-s2.0-105001486551,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001486551
Exploring Engagement With and Effectiveness of Digital Mental Health Interventions in Young People of Different Ethnicities: Systematic Review,Bakhti R.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The prevalence of mental health difficulties among young people has risen in recent years, with 75% of mental disorders emerging before the age of 24 years. The identification and treatment of mental health issues earlier in life improves later-life outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred the growth of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), which offer accessible support. However, young people of different ethnicities face barriers to DMHIs, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and cultural stigma. Objective: This review aimed to summarize and evaluate the engagement with and effectiveness of DMHIs among young people of different ethnicities. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies published between January 2019 and May 2024, with an update in September 2024. The inclusion criteria were participants aged <25 years using DMHIs from various ethnic backgrounds. Three reviewers independently screened and selected the studies. Data on engagement (eg, use and uptake) and effectiveness (eg, clinical outcomes and symptom improvement) were extracted and synthesized to compare findings. Studies were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: The final search yielded 67 studies, of which 7 (10%) met inclusion criteria. There were 1853 participants across the 7 studies, all from high-income countries. Participants were predominantly aged 12 to 25 years, with representation of diverse ethnic identities, including Black, Asian, Hispanic, mixed race, and Aboriginal individuals. Engagement outcomes varied, with culturally relatable, low-cost interventions showing higher retention and user satisfaction. Linguistic barriers and country of origin impeded the effectiveness of some interventions, while near-peer mentorship, coproduction, and tailored content improved the effectiveness of DMHIs. While initial results are promising, small sample sizes, heterogeneity in outcome assessments, and a paucity of longitudinal data impeded robust comparisons and generalizability. Conclusions: DMHIs show potential as engaging and effective mental health promotional tools for young people of different ethnicities, especially when coproduced and culturally relatable. Initial data suggest that interventions facilitating near-peer mentoring, linguistic adaptation, low cost, and cultural relatability have improved engagement and effectiveness. Future research should focus on developing a consensus definition of DMHIs, exploring DMHIs in children aged <12 years, and conducting detailed qualitative and quantitative research on use factors and treatment efficacy of DMHIs for young people of different ethnicities.",10.2196/68544,1,Scopus,105002015502,2-s2.0-105002015502,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002015502
Web-mediated psychological intervention for adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes: a systematic review,De Maio N.,2025,Psychology Health and Medicine,"Type 1 diabetes is a complex chronic illness that requires daily care-management and constant psychological adaptation. In adolescence and young adulthood, the crossover between the developmental challenges and the daily demands of the disease may cause poor psychological and physical outcomes. In light of the recent momentous rise in psychological online treatment, this systematic review explores the field of web-mediated psychological intervention for Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) with type 1 diabetes, thus aiming to identify the components of effective online treatment. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We systematically searched the literature published between 2014 and 2024 from EBSCO (APA PsycArticles, APAPsycInfo; Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection; MEDLINE), PUBMED, and SCOPUS. The Quality assessment tool for quantitative studies was used to rate the quality of the articles. Eight eligible studies were included in the review. Telehealth is effective on disease-management and psychosocial outcomes. However, mixed results emerged on psychological outcomes. The interventions are effective on diabetes-distress; however, the results on depressive and anxiety symptoms show some limitations. Overall, the interventions reached high acceptability and feasibility. Despite the paucity of data, results suggest that web-mediated interventions are a viable way to support the psychological needs of young diabetics. The inclusion of psychosocial support components may further enhance the efficacy of the intervention, addressing the needs of social support for young diabetics. This review has some operative implications, giving useful insight into designing personalized interventions within this population. However, more research is needed.",10.1080/13548506.2025.2564314,0,Scopus,105018834526,2-s2.0-105018834526,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018834526
It is Time to Realize the Promise of the Digital Mental Health Transformation: Application for Population Mental Health,Adler J.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"The past 25 years have seen the explosion of digital health care—from 1s and 0s initially serving most researchers for accomplishing their work, to the creation of smartphones, mHealth, and more recently artificial intelligence. The revolution for digital mental health is no longer in its infancy, as new tools are created to address mental health, sometimes even undergoing evaluation for adoption and efficacy. In fact, a recent study reporting on National Health Interview Survey data (annually conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics) indicated that, in 2024, 40% of adults reporting serious psychological distress used a digital health tool, which has increased from 21% in 2017 and 10% in 2013. Given the widespread access to digital tools and the potential of digital mental health, it is time for a new paradigm of care to address the mental health crisis in the United States. Reactive care, consisting largely of medication and counseling provided to those already experiencing severe or debilitating symptoms of mental anguish, is not adequate to address the needs of 22.8% of the US population (>55 million people) experiencing symptoms of a mental illness, and the larger number of people with preclinical mental health concerns. A population mental health approach is needed that includes early identification, intervention, and prevention, in addition to reactive care.",10.2196/63791,0,Scopus,105008516426,2-s2.0-105008516426,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008516426
Disorder-specific psychotherapy of depression,Köhler S.,2025,Psychotherapie,"Depressive disorders are among the most common and severe mental illnesses worldwide. Although the prevalence remains stable, the utilization of therapeutic services is steadily increasing, particularly among young adults and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. This development is positive but poses significant challenges to the healthcare system. The National Clinical Practice Guidelines (NVL) for unipolar depression recommend psychotherapy as a central treatment approach. For mild depression low-intensity interventions, such as psychoeducation or online programs are recommended. For moderate episodes, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are considered equally effective and for severe episodes a combination of both is recommended. In chronic depression a combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants is also considered more effective than monotherapy. Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) for acute depression and the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) for chronic depression are disorder-specific methods with moderate effectiveness, especially when combined with pharmacotherapy. In addition, modular psychotherapy approaches that are flexible and individually tailored to symptoms and underlying processes are presented; however, gaps in care and long waiting times hinder practical implementation, which is why innovative models are gaining in importance. Digital applications and artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising potential for personalized therapy support. The development of controlled digital offers is essential to ensure quality and effectiveness and to provide reliable guidance.",10.1007/s00278-025-00809-x,0,Scopus,105019357323,2-s2.0-105019357323,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019357323
"Unpacking the Relationship Among Undergraduates’ Artificial Intelligence Anxiety, Readiness, Perceived Competence, and Digital Literacy",Obateru O.T.,2025,International Journal of Learning in Higher Education,"Artificial intelligence (AI)−related constructs and digital literacy have become a major research hub, especially in the education sector, due to technological inventions and innovations. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship among university students’ AI anxiety, readiness, perceived competence, and digital literacy. This study, therefore, investigates these relationships among undergraduates in selected Nigerian southwest universities. The study adopts the cross-sectional research design and is anchored on the Connectivism Theory of Learning (CTL). A total of 490 undergraduates were randomly chosen for the study. Four adapted research questionnaires were used to collect data for the study, which was analyzed using a partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique to test the hypothesized model. The study’s findings indicate a positive and significant relationship among undergraduates’ AI anxiety, readiness, and digital literacy. However, a nonsignificant relationship exists between AI anxiety and undergraduates’ perceived competence in AI. Thus, efforts to foster digital literacy, AI readiness, and competencies (while ameliorating AI anxieties) among undergraduates must consider how each construct influences the others. This study recommends inculcating AI knowledge and skills into the Nigerian higher education curricula. AI systems, applications, and fully equipped AI technology/tool centers should be established and operational in every country’s higher education institutions, especially universities, among others.",10.18848/2327-7955/CGP/v33i01/97-119,0,Scopus,105013524289,2-s2.0-105013524289,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013524289
Detecting Students Stress and Fatigue in Online Learning using Machine Learning,Moganapriya B.,2025,Proceedings 3rd International Conference on Self Sustainable Artificial Intelligence Systems Icssas 2025,"The growing trend towards online education has created concerns regarding students' stress and fatigue, which have negative effects on academic achievement and mental well-being. Conventional methods of identifying stress, including surveys and self-reporting, are subjective and not in real-time. This paper suggests a new DL-based method employing a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to identify levels of stress and fatigue among students. The proposed model incorporates multimodal information, such as facial expressions, voice tone, and keystroke dynamics, to improve detection accuracy. The designed framework analyzes webcam-recorded emotions, speech, and typing patterns to classify stress levels accurately. This trained and tested our model on data gathered from university students enrolling in online classes, with 92.3% accuracy, outperforming conventional machine learning techniques such as SVM and Random Forest. This study offers a basis for real-time monitoring systems in online learning, facilitating timely interventions to enhance student well-being and learning achievement.

"Development, Acceptability and Engagement with the Mind Tutor: Lessons Learned from Testing a Novel Digital Application for First Year UK Undergraduate Student Wellbeing",Davies E.L.,2025,Psychological Studies,"University student wellbeing has been declining in recent years, leading to increased demand for universities to provide support services. This paper aims to describe the development process of a novel chatbot enhanced app for student wellbeing, the Mind Tutor, and to evaluate the acceptability of this app. The paper also serves to provide multiple lessons learned from the development process and the testing of the app, which will be of use to other researchers in the field. Mind Tutor was developed with input from students and university service stakeholders. Findings from the development process suggested that the app should focus content on anxiety, mood, managing academic work, transitions and balance and relationships. Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) within the app were information provision, goal setting, mindfulness, skills/actions and reframing. Mind Tutor content relating to transitions appeared to be the most acceptable to students; however, engagement with the app was poor (two interactions per student). Although universities are keen to offer app-based wellbeing support to students, and students may like such tools, our study demonstrates that low engagement may impact the efficacy of such tools. Considerations for future research are discussed, including the practicality of randomised controlled trials, better integration with existing support services and integration with learning and teaching platforms. The paper also advocates for greater use of co-production methods, and the need to ensure appropriate face-to-face support is not superseded by digital technology.",10.1007/s12646-025-00865-y,0,Scopus,105019758448,2-s2.0-105019758448,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019758448

Machine Learning Approach to Analyse the Mental Health and Predict Nomophobia,Jangir M.K.,2025,2025 International Conference on Networks and Cryptology Netcrypt 2025,"With the growing concern in today's digital world, the fear of not having a mobile phone, which is termed as nomophobia, has become an alarming issue, especially for the youth, because of its drastic effect on mental health in terms of anxiety, stress, and depression. This research develops a predictive framework to identify severe nomophobics by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. A sample of 841 students from university in Kosovo completed the survey through purposive and stratified sampling to ensure a balanced dataset. Due to the robustness of handling non-linear relationships and large datasets, the Random Forest (RF) model was employed as the primary predictive tool. Machine learning combined with descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation was used to describe relationships between nomophobia and other mental health outcomes. Results showed that the severity of nomophobia had significant positive correlations with anxiety, stress, and depression. The RF model demonstrated excellent predictability with a value of 0.9773 for R2, showing that it explained about 98 % of the variation in the nomophobia severity scores. This was 15 % better than traditional models such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This makes the model a dependable tool for the early detection. The feature importance analysis further identifies the key behavioral and psychological predictors of nomophobia and provides some deeper insights into the underlying determinants.",10.1109/NETCRYPT65877.2025.11102285,0,Scopus,105015415799,2-s2.0-105015415799,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015415799
Adolescent mental health state assessment framework by combining YOLO with random forest,Wan M.,2025,Applied Soft Computing,"The problems of adolescent mental health are becoming increasingly prominent. The house-tree-person test (HTPT) method can map the psychological state of subjects and has been widely used in clinical testing. However, the HTPT method requires an amount of time for professionals to assess. Based on the HTPT method, how to use artificial intelligence technology to quickly, objectively, and automatically complete mental state assessments has become a new trend. In this paper, a Hybrid of Enhanced YOLO and Random Forest algorithm for adolescent mental health assessment is proposed. Because of the dependence between HTPT feature positions, Bayesian theory is used to enhance YOLO to improve detection accuracy. Among the many features detected by the enhanced YOLO algorithm, RF is used to automatically assess mental state. The method is validated by simulation experiments and actual measurements of university students. Moreover, the simulation results show that the recognition accuracy can reach 92% and the recognition speed can reach the second level. The measured results show that this method can quickly and accurately assess mental state.",10.1016/j.asoc.2024.112497,5,Scopus,85210089253,2-s2.0-85210089253,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210089253
An On-Board Executable Multi-Feature Transfer-Enhanced Fusion Model for Three-Lead EEG Sensor-Assisted Depression Diagnosis,Tian F.,2025,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,"The development of affective computing and medical electronic technologies has led to the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods for the early detection of depression. However, previous studies have often overlooked the necessity for the AI-assisted diagnosis system to be wearable and accessible in practical scenarios for depression recognition. In this work, we present an on-board executable multi-feature transfer-enhanced fusion model for our custom-designed wearable three-lead Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor, based on EEG data collected from 73 depressed patients and 108 healthy controls. Experimental results show that the proposed model exhibits low-computational complexity (65.0 K parameters), promising Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) performance (25.6 M), real-time processing (1.5 s/execution), and low power consumption (320.8 mW). Furthermore, it requires only 202.0 KB of Random Access Memory (RAM) and 279.6 KB of Read-Only Memory (ROM) when deployed on the EEG sensor. Despite its low computational and spatial complexity, the model achieves a notable classification accuracy of 95.2%, specificity of 94.0%, and sensitivity of 96.9% under independent test conditions. These results underscore the potential of deploying the model on the wearable three-lead EEG sensor for assisting in the diagnosis of depression.",10.1109/JBHI.2024.3487012,16,Scopus,85208257265,2-s2.0-85208257265,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208257265
"DigiBete, a Novel Chatbot to Support Transition to Adult Care of Young People/Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Outcomes From a Prospective, Multimethod, Nonrandomized Feasibility and Acceptability Study",Swallow V.,2025,Jmir Diabetes,"Background: Transition to adult health care for young people and young adults (YP/YA) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) starts around 11 years of age, but transition services may not meet their needs. A combination of self-management support digital health technologies exists, but no supportive chatbots with components to help YP/YA with T1DM were identified. Objective: The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate the novel DigiBete Chatbot, the first user-led, developmentally appropriate, clinically approved transition chatbot for YP/YA with T1DM from four English diabetes services and (2) assess the feasibility of a future trial of the chatbot. Methods: In a prospective, multimethod, nonrandomized feasibility and acceptability study in the UK National Health Service, YP/YA with T1DM from 4 hospital diabetes clinics (2 pretransition and 2 posttransition) were enrolled in a 6-week study to test the DigiBete Chatbot. During the study, YP/YA completed web-based, validated, and standardized questionnaires at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks to evaluate quality of life and anxiety and depression, along with chatbot usability and acceptability. Qualitative interviews involving YP/YA, parents, and health care professionals explored their views on the chatbot. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and framework analysis. Results: Eighteen YP/YA were enrolled. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 4 parents, 24 health care professionals, and 12 YP/YA. Questionnaire outputs and the emergent qualitative themes (living with T1DM, using the chatbot, and refining the chatbot) indicated that the measures are feasible to use and the chatbot is acceptable and functional. In addition, responses indicated that, with refinements that incorporate the feasibility results, the chatbot could beneficially support YP/YA during transition. Users scored the chatbot as “good” to “excellent” for being engaging, informative, and aesthetically pleasing, and they stated that they would use it again. The results suggest that, with some adaptations based on user feedback, the chatbot was feasible and acceptable among the YP/YA who enjoyed using it. Our reactive conversational agent offers content (messaging and additional multimedia resources) that is relevant for the target population and clinically approved. The DigiBete Chatbot addresses the identified lack of personalized and supported self-management tools available for 11‐24 year olds with T1DM and other chronic conditions. Conclusions: These results warrant chatbot refinement and further investigation in a full trial to augment it prior to its wider clinical use. Our research design and methodology could also be transferred to using chatbots for other long-term conditions. On the premise of this feasibility study, the plan is to rebuild the DigiBete Chatbot to meet identified user needs and preferences and progress to a national cohort study to assess the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of a modified chatbot, with a view to proceeding to rollout for national and international use on the established DigiBete platform.",10.2196/74032,0,Scopus,105013866438,2-s2.0-105013866438,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013866438

Confiding to AI: Impacts of ICE Framework-Based Body Movements of VR Chatbots on User Self-Disclosure and Experience,Liu Y.,2025,International Journal of Human Computer Interaction,"Chatbots enhanced by VR can deliver rich social cues through both verbal and non-verbal communication. While existing research emphasizes verbal factors and visual anthropomorphism, systematic exploration of body movements remains limited. This study proposes the Interactive-Cheerful-Empathic (ICE) Movements Framework, mapping body movements to three psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We developed a VR chatbot (Hilie) with four movement modes (interactive, cheerful, empathic, and no movement) and conducted a single-factor within-subjects experiment involving 56 university students. Quantitative and qualitative results revealed that chatbots with body movements—particularly cheerful movements—significantly enhanced users’ self-disclosure willingness, satisfaction, trust, and intention to use compared to static counterparts. The ICE framework effectively addresses multi-level psychological needs through coordinated movements. This work pioneers the operationalization of self-determination theory in chatbot design, providing theoretical models and practical guidelines for developing highly anthropomorphic chatbots, while advancing optimization strategies for online mental health services.",10.1080/10447318.2025.2540060,0,Scopus,105015218193,2-s2.0-105015218193,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015218193
Effectiveness of AI-Driven Conversational Agents in Improving Mental Health Among Young People: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Feng Y.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The increasing prevalence of mental health issues among adolescents and young adults, coupled with barriers to accessing traditional therapy, has led to growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven conversational agents (CAs) as a novel digital mental health intervention. Despite accumulating evidence suggesting the effectiveness of AI-driven CAs for mental health, there is still limited evidence on their effectiveness for different mental health conditions in adolescents and young adults. Objective: This study aims to examine the effectiveness of AI-driven CAs for mental health among young people, and explore the potential moderators of efficacy. Methods: A total of 5 main databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched systematically dated from the establishment of the database to August 6, 2024. Randomized controlled trials comparing AI-driven CAs with any other type of control condition in improving depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, stress, mental well-being, and positive and negative affect were considered eligible when they were conducted in young people aged 12-25 years. The quality of these studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers and checked by a third reviewer. Pooled effect sizes (Hedges g) were calculated using random effect models and visually presented in forest plots. Results: A total of 14 articles (including 15 trials) were included, involving 1974 participants. The results indicated that, after adjustment for publication bias, AI-driven CAs had a moderate-to-large (Hedges g=0.61, 95% CI 0.35-0.86) effect on depressive symptoms compared to control conditions. However, their effect sizes adjusting for publication bias for generalized anxiety symptoms (Hedges g=0.06, 95% CI –0.21 to 0.32), stress (Hedges g=0.002, 95% CI –0.19 to 0.20), positive affect (Hedges g=0.01, 95% CI –0.24 to 0.27), negative affect (Hedges g=0.07, 95% CI –0.13 to 0.27), and mental well-being (Hedges g=0.04, 95% CI –0.21 to 0.29) were all nonsignificant. Subgroup analyses revealed that AI-driven CAs were particularly effective in improving depressive symptoms among subclinical populations (Hedges g=0.74, 95% CI 0.50-0.98). Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of AI-driven CAs for early intervention in depression among this population, and underscore the need for further improvements to enhance their efficacy across a broader range of mental health outcomes. Key limitations of the reviewed evidence include heterogeneity in therapeutic orientations of CAs and lack of follow-up measures. Future research should explore the long-term effects of AI-driven CAs on mental health outcomes.",10.2196/69639,1,Scopus,105005173919,2-s2.0-105005173919,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005173919
AI-Based Facial Analysis vs Self-Report: A Pilot Study Using Insights From Pre-Procedural Psychological Tests,Mamcarz I.,2025,Medical Science Monitor,"Background: Material/Methods: Results: Conclusions: Aesthetic procedures aligning with societal beauty standards are gaining popularity, often driven by unrealistic beauty ideals. However, these treatments frequently disappoint individuals with low self-esteem and distorted self-images. AI tools offer potential for a more objective assessment, generating pre-treatment simulations. This study explores the relationship between psychological profiles and AI evaluations. Forty-seven participants underwent psychological tests (TIPI-PL, SWLS, Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale, and SelfPerception Scale). An AI neural network analyzed facial images across 7 traits: attractiveness, competence, restfulness, joy, dominance, health, and trustworthiness. The AI application dedicated to tablets that we used is available online. After taking a photo of the face, the application creates a heatmap with facial features pictured on the scale. Participants also self-assessed these traits using the SPS scale. Pearson’s r and the MannWhitney U tests were used to examine correlations and compare AI and self-assessment results. The AI-based analysis assessed female faces as more attractive (P<0.001), more rested (P=0.004), happier (P<0.001) and more trustworthy (P<0.001). There was a significant association trending towards statistical significance between ‘Competent’ and ‘Rested’ AI results with TIPI Extraversion (P=0.045). None of the other results of the analysis of psychological status, personality types, self-esteem, and well-being reached statistical significance. AI applications present promising opportunities for enhancing medical practices. In this study we observed some limitations, especially concerning the intricate interplay between physical appearance, psychological factors, and AI facial evaluation. The SPS scale was significantly correlated with other psychological tests, although AI ratings were generally lower than self-assessments. Therefore, AI should not be the only tool used for planning aesthetic procedures.",10.12659/MSM.947227,0,Scopus,105011883636,2-s2.0-105011883636,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105011883636
Detecting Perceived Unfair Treatment Among US College Students Using Mobile Sensing: Pilot Machine Learning Study,Ren Y.,2025,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Experiences of unfair treatment on college campuses are linked to adverse mental and physical health outcomes, highlighting the need for interventions. However, detecting such experiences relies mainly on self-reports. No prior research has examined the feasibility of using mobile sensing via smartphones and wearables for the passive detection of these experiences. Objective: This pilot study explores the potential of using passive sensing to detect daily experiences of perceived unfair treatment (PUT) after they occur. It aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models against naive baselines and establish a benchmark for future research. Methods: We analyzed data from 201 undergraduate students collected over two 10-week academic terms in 2018. PUT was self-reported at the daily level via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys, with 413 of 9629 (4.3%) total responses indicating unfair treatment. We implemented two modeling approaches with distinct training schemes: (1) supervised classification models trained in a user-independent manner using data from different individuals, and (2) anomaly detection models trained in a user-dependent manner using historical data from the same individuals. Classification performance was assessed using stratified group 5-fold cross-validation for user-independent models and a chronological train-test split for user-dependent models. Results: Of the 201 study participants, 110 reported experiencing unfair treatment at least once. On average, participants reported unfair treatment in 4.66% of their EMA responses (95% CI 3.13% to 6.19%). User-independent classification models showed mixed performance (AUC-ROC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve]: 0.546-0.640, AUC-PR [area under the precision-recall curve]: 0.047-0.093, F1-score: 0.070-0.121). Tree-based models, particularly light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and Random Forest, outperformed all 3 baselines in AUC-ROC and AUC-PR; LightGBM also improved the F1-score. In comparison, user-dependent anomaly detection models performed better, with the multiday long short-term memory-AE model (50 features, 7-day window) achieving the highest recall (0.830, +73.3%, P<.001) and F1-score (0.391, +24.9%, P<.001) without reducing precision (0.256), and improving AUC-PR by 45.9% and AUC-ROC by 21.6% relative to naive baselines (P<.001). Feature importance analysis identified key behavioral patterns for population-level detection, including increased time spent off campus, elevated evening and nighttime activity, reduced indoor mobility on campus, prolonged screen use, delayed sleep onset, and shorter sleep duration. Conclusions: Mobile sensing shows promise for detecting daily experiences of PUT in college students and identifying associated behavioral patterns. Our findings highlight opportunities for timely interventions through mobile technology to mitigate the impact of these experiences on students' mental health and well-being.",10.2196/78657,0,Scopus,105020435761,2-s2.0-105020435761,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020435761
The impact of online food delivery applications on dietary pattern disruption in the Arab region,Qasrawi R.,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,"Background: While online food delivery applications (OFDAs) offer convenient food accessibility, their impact on dietary behaviors remains insufficiently explored, especially in the Arab region. This study applies machine learning (ML) techniques to identify the key behavioral and nutritional factors contributing to dietary disruption linked to OFD platforms. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study which involved 7,370 adults across 10 Arab countries using a comprehensive online survey. The study employed an ensemble ML approach, comparing Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM tree-based models to analyze 31 features across six domains: demographics, ordering frequency, food preferences, nutritional perceptions, behavioral factors, and service attributes. Model performance was evaluated using multiple metrics, including sensitivity, precision, F1-score, and AUC. Clear interpretation of the risk factors was explained using partial dependence plots. Results: The findings revealed that the strongest predictors of dietary disruption were excessive food consumption, altered meal routines, and preferences for fatty foods. Younger individuals, males, and those with higher BMI reported higher disruption rates. Lebanon and Bahrain showed the highest rates for notable disruption, while Oman reported the lowest. ML analysis demonstrated high predictive performance, with Random Forest achieving the highest sensitivity (94.3%) and F1-score (89.3%). Feature importance analysis identified behavioral factors as more influential than socioeconomic indicators. Conclusion: OFDAs offer valuable convenience and market expansion while simultaneously posing significant challenges to maintaining optimal dietary health. With strategic interventions and public health collaborations, these platforms can shift from being disruptors of healthy dietary habits to catalysts for improved nutrition and well-being in the Arab region and beyond.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1569945,1,Scopus,105008757622,2-s2.0-105008757622,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008757622
Web-browsing patterns reflect and shape mood and mental health,Kelly C.A.,2025,Nature Human Behaviour,"Humans spend on average 6.5 hours a day online. A large portion of that time is dedicated to information-seeking. How does this activity impact mental health? We assess this over four studies (n = 1,145). We reveal that the valence of information sought affects mental health, which in turn influences the valence of information sought, forming a self-reinforcing loop. We quantified the valence of text on webpages participants chose to browse using natural language processing and found that browsing more negative information was associated with worse mental health and mood. By manipulating the webpages browsed and measuring mood and vice versa, we show that the relationship is causal and bidirectional. Finally, we developed an intervention that altered web-browsing patterns in a manner that improved mood. Together, the findings suggest that the information sought reflects mental state and shapes it, creating a loop that may perpetuate mental health problems. The results also provide a potential method for assessing and enhancing welfare in the digital age.",10.1038/s41562-024-02065-6,7,Scopus,85209735158,2-s2.0-85209735158,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209735158
Motivation and socialization during summer predict medical students’ success: An artificial intelligence study,Pensier J.,2025,Medical Teacher,"Purpose: The latest reform of French medical studies has moved the National Ranking Examination before residency to the beginning of the sixth-year for undergraduate medical students, thus placing unprecedented workload during the preceding summer. The main objective was to determine whether study conditions and psychosocial factors were associated with student success in this model of intense workload. Materials and Methods: An online survey designed with six student-partners was sent at a French Medical School after the examination in 2023. The primary outcome was student success in achieving their main goal (Ranking, Knowledge, Well-being). A machine-learning model (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) was developed and explained using Artificial Intelligence. An AI-guided multivariate logistic regression was performed, Odd Ratios were calculated. Results: Out of 123 responses, 75 (61%) of the students achieved their main goal. Motivation and socialization during the summer were the two most important variables for predicting student success. In guided multivariate logistic regression, summer motivation (Odd Ratio = 4.12, 95%CI[1.75–10.30]), summer loneliness (Odd Ratio = 0.35, 95%CI[0.14–0.86]), and student’s main goal (Ranking, Odd Ratio = 2.94, 95%CI[1.15–7.79]) were associated with student success. Conclusions: Motivation and socialization during the summer preceding high-stakes examinations are strongly predictive of undergraduate medical students’ success. This study highlights the importance of well-being during summer for student success.",10.1080/0142159X.2024.2429614,2,Scopus,85210170526,2-s2.0-85210170526,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210170526
Application of EEG-Based Machine Learning in Time–Frequency and Brain Connectivity Analysis Among Individuals at High Risk of Internet Gaming Disorder with Social Anxiety,Yeh P.Y.,2025,International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction,"Previously reported association between internet gaming disorder (IGD) and social anxiety (SA) was based on subjective questionnaires, while objective assessment of socioemotional stress using electroencephalography (EEG) was hindered by the absence of a reproducible realistic environment. Harnessing virtual reality (VR) technology, we investigated the characteristics of social scenario-triggered EEG signals in high-risk IGD individuals to develop a machine learning (ML) model for risk prediction. Thirty college students considered at high risk of IGD (HIGD) and thirty low-risk counterparts (LIGD) first completed three emotion-related questionnaires. EEG data in response to VR-based socioemotional stress were gathered using a VR headset with eight electrodes. The frequency components of time-domain signals and intra-brain synchronization of EEG information were analyzed with non-parametric tests. MATLAB’s fitcauto and fscmrmr were used on 564 EEG features per participant to classify the two groups, with k-nearest neighbors (kNN) identified as the optimal algorithm. The HIGD group exhibited more severe depression (p = 0.001) and SA (p = 0.02) than the LIGD group. Compared with the LIGD group, the HIGD group demonstrated lower neural activities at F3, Fz, F4, C3, C4, P3, and P4. Besides, HIGD individuals showed less intense delta/theta-band and frontal gamma-band synchronizations than in the LIGD group. Furthermore, EEG-based kNN identified 20 key EEG features for detecting HIGD with an accuracy of 97% and an area under the curve of 0.97. The findings highlighted the feasibility of assessing EEG responses to socioemotional stress in individuals with HIGD and SA, and applying an EEG-based kNN for early identification.",10.1007/s11469-025-01560-9,0,Scopus,105018325083,2-s2.0-105018325083,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018325083
A comprehensive evaluation of digital mental health literature: an integrative review and bibliometric analysis,Alan H.,2025,Behaviour and Information Technology,"All over the world, the way we receive a variety of services including mental health treatment has changed and been redefined by the internet and digital transformation. An important turning point in the development of digital mental health studies was the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of major journals that have a large number of publications on digital mental health research is increasing. The aim of this study is to organize groups, research directions, and related topics in the digital mental health literature by using 11 search terms, while taking into account how technology is developing and how information sharing is made simpler. A bibliometric analysis of 2440 publications from qualitative and quantitative sources was done in order to achieve this goal. Information and technology, mental health issues, and groups were the three categories of themes identified by the conceptual framework. The prominent terms comprising artificial intelligence, virtual reality, machine learning, and big data are concentrated in the information and technology-related group, and the second group comprising eating disorder, anxiety, and schizophrenia are related to mental health disorders, lastly mental health nurses, children, adolescents, and young people (particularly university students) are discussed under the third group.",10.1080/0144929X.2024.2303626,3,Scopus,85182175328,2-s2.0-85182175328,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182175328
A staged approach to the development of an embodied conversational agent to support wellbeing after injury,Hopman K.,2025,Behaviour and Information Technology,"Poor mental health following traumatic injury is associated with disability, delayed return to work and reduced quality of life. Digital mental health and wellbeing programs may provide an opportunity to support mental health post-injury. This paper describes the development of an embodied conversational agent to deliver an interactive emotion regulation psychoeducation program (ERICA), to support mental health following injury. Iterative program development, with a key focus of ensuring safety, was achieved via two acceptability studies. Study one used mixed methods to test program acceptability and preliminary effects in a sample of 138 university students with ready access to psychological support services. Results confirmed the feasibility of the conversational agent approach and provided evidence that the content had an immediate impact on participant’s self-efficacy and beliefs about how they manage emotions. Study two consisted of 13 semi-structured, qualitative interviews with people with a lived experience of recovering from injury or adversity. Interviews following participant engagement with ERICA identified four key themes: visual look, voice, content and experience.

Digital Health Interventions for Adolescents with Long-Term Health Conditions in South Africa: A Scoping Review,Crowley T.,2025,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Adolescents with long-term health conditions may benefit from digital health interventions (DHIs) to support self-management. The study aimed to map the current research on DHIs for adolescents with long-term conditions in South Africa, focusing on the types of interventions, targeted chronic conditions, and reported outcomes. The scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Searches were conducted in electronic databases such as EBSCOHost (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Ultimate, and APA PSycArticles), Wiley Online Library, and PubMed for articles published between 2014 and 2024. Studies that (1) involved adolescents with a long-term health condition (aged 15–24) residing in South Africa, (2) reported on the use of digital health technology, and (3) provided empirical evidence were included. Nine studies were included in the analysis, focusing primarily on HIV, depression/anxiety, and diabetes. Most interventions utilized WhatsApp, SMS, or social media to provide peer or healthcare worker support. Process outcomes like acceptability and feasibility dominated, with limited data on effectiveness. DHIs show potential for supporting adolescent health but cover a limited number of long-term health conditions and face barriers to effective implementation. Affordable, context-specific solutions co-designed with adolescents are crucial to enhance engagement and ensure scalability in the South African context.

An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Text Classifier for Suicidality Prediction in Youth Crisis Text Line Users: Development and Validation Study,Thomas J.,2025,Jmir Public Health and Surveillance,"Background: Suicide represents a critical public health concern, and machine learning (ML) models offer the potential for identifying at-risk individuals. Recent studies using benchmark datasets and real-world social media data have demonstrated the capability of pretrained large language models in predicting suicidal ideation and behaviors (SIB) in speech and text. Objective: This study aimed to (1) develop and implement ML methods for predicting SIBs in a real-world crisis helpline dataset, using transformer-based pretrained models as a foundation; (2) evaluate, cross-validate, and benchmark the model against traditional text classification approaches; and (3) train an explainable model to highlight relevant risk-associated features. Methods: We analyzed chat protocols from adolescents and young adults (aged 14-25 years) seeking assistance from a German crisis helpline. An ML model was developed using a transformer-based language model architecture with pretrained weights and long short-term memory layers. The model predicted suicidal ideation (SI) and advanced suicidal engagement (ASE), as indicated by composite Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores. We compared model performance against a classical word-vector-based ML model. We subsequently computed discrimination, calibration, clinical utility, and explainability information using a Shapley Additive Explanations value-based post hoc estimation model. Results: The dataset comprised 1348 help-seeking encounters (1011 for training and 337 for testing). The transformer-based classifier achieved a macroaveraged area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.89 (95% CI 0.81-0.91) and an overall accuracy of 0.79 (95% CI 0.73-0.99). This performance surpassed the word-vector-based baseline model (AUC-ROC=0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.90; accuracy=0.61, 95% CI 0.61-0.80). The transformer model demonstrated excellent prediction for nonsuicidal sessions (AUC-ROC=0.96, 95% CI 0.96-0.99) and good prediction for SI and ASE, with AUC-ROCs of 0.85 (95% CI 0.97-0.86) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.81-0.88), respectively. The Brier Skill Score indicated a 44% improvement in classification performance over the baseline model. The Shapley Additive Explanations model identified language features predictive of SIBs, including self-reference, negation, expressions of low self-esteem, and absolutist language. Conclusions: Neural networks using large language model–based transfer learning can accurately identify SI and ASE. The post hoc explainer model revealed language features associated with SI and ASE. Such models may potentially support clinical decision-making in suicide prevention services. Future research should explore multimodal input features and temporal aspects of suicide risk.",10.2196/63809,1,Scopus,85216894583,2-s2.0-85216894583,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216894583

Extracting social support and social isolation information from clinical psychiatry notes: comparing a rule-based natural language processing system and a large language model,Patra B.G.,2025,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,"Objectives: Social support (SS) and social isolation (SI) are social determinants of health (SDOH) associated with psychiatric outcomes. In electronic health records (EHRs), individual-level SS/SI is typically documented in narrative clinical notes rather than as structured coded data. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms can automate the otherwise labor-intensive process of extraction of such information. Materials and Methods: Psychiatric encounter notes from Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS, n = 300) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM, n = 225) were annotated to create a gold-standard corpus. A rule-based system (RBS) involving lexicons and a large language model (LLM) using FLAN-T5-XL were developed to identify mentions of SS and SI and their subcategories (eg, social network, instrumental support, and loneliness). Results: For extracting SS/SI, the RBS obtained higher macroaveraged F1-scores than the LLM at both MSHS (0.89 versus 0.65) and WCM (0.85 versus 0.82). For extracting the subcategories, the RBS also outperformed the LLM at both MSHS (0.90 versus 0.62) and WCM (0.82 versus 0.81). Discussion and Conclusion: Unexpectedly, the RBS outperformed the LLMs across all metrics. An intensive review demonstrates that this finding is due to the divergent approach taken by the RBS and LLM. The RBS was designed and refined to follow the same specific rules as the gold-standard annotations. Conversely, the LLM was more inclusive with categorization and conformed to common English-language understanding. Both approaches offer advantages, although additional replication studies are warranted.",10.1093/jamia/ocae260,7,Scopus,85212991589,2-s2.0-85212991589,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212991589
Enhancing Virtual Restorative Environment with Generative AI: Personalized Immersive Stress-Relief Experiences,Chang K.Y.,2025,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"In today’s fast-paced world, stress and mental health challenges are becoming more common. Restorative environments help people relax and recover emotionally, and Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) offers a way to experience these benefits beyond physical limitations. However, most VRET applications rely on pre-designed content, limiting their adaptability to individual needs. This study explores how Generative AI can enhance VRET by creating personalized, immersive environments that better match users’ preferences and improve relaxation. To evaluate the impact of AI-generated restorative environments, we combined EEG measurements with user interviews. Thirty university students participated in the study, experiencing two different modes: static mode and walking mode. The EEG results showed an increase in Theta (θ) and High Beta (β) brain waves, suggesting a state of deep immersion accompanied by heightened cognitive engagement and mental effort. While participants found the experience enjoyable and engaging, the AI-generated environments tended to create excitement and focus rather than conventional relaxation. These findings suggest that for AI-generated environments in VRET to be more effective for stress relief, future designs should reduce cognitive load while maintaining immersion. This study provides insights into how AI can enhance relaxation experiences and introduces a new perspective on personalized digital stress-relief solutions.",10.1007/978-3-031-93502-2_9,0,Scopus,105007759157,2-s2.0-105007759157,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007759157
"Nomophobia, Psychopathology, and Smartphone-Inferred Behaviors in Youth With Depression: Longitudinal Study",Zhang T.,2025,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Smartphones have become an indispensable part of people’s lives, and the fear of being without them, what has been termed “no mobile phone phobia” (nomophobia), is a growing phenomenon. The rise of problematic smartphone use highlights the urgent need to explore the intricate relationship between smartphones and human behavior. However, the connections between nomophobia, mental health indicators, smartphone use patterns, and daily activities remain largely underexplored. Objective: This study aimed to explore the relationship between young adults with depression and smartphones and investigate nomophobia by analyzing data obtained from a pilot study of depression in a youth cohort. Exploring nomophobia can enhance our understanding of the dynamics between young adults and smartphone use, potentially empowering them to manage and regulate their smartphone use more effectively. Methods: During an 8-week period, data collected via smartphone sensors, such as locations and screen status, were gathered from a cohort of 41 individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder. In addition to passive-sensing smartphone data, the study collected ecological momentary assessments and psychometric measures, including the Nomophobia Questionnaire, which formed the basis of our investigation. We explored statistical associations among smartphone-derived behavioral features, psychometric indicators, and nomophobia. In addition, we used behavioral and psychometric data to develop regression models demonstrating the prediction of nomophobia levels. Results: Our findings revealed that the level of nomophobia was positively associated with depression and negative affect, lower geolocation movements, and higher comfort with smartphone sensing. The exploratory predictive linear regression models demonstrated the feasibility of predicting an individual’s Nomophobia Questionnaire score based on their smartphone sensing data. These models effectively used input features derived from both a combination of smartphone sensing data and psychometric measures and from smartphone sensing data alone. Conclusions: Our work is the first to explore the relationship between nomophobia and smartphone sensor data. It provides valuable insights into the predictors of nomophobia level, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between smartphones and human behavior and paving the way for future studies.",10.2196/57512,0,Scopus,85218800683,2-s2.0-85218800683,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218800683
Evaluating predictive artificial intelligence approaches used in mobile health platforms to forecast mental health symptoms among youth: a systematic review,Patel J.,2025,Psychiatry Research,"The youth mental health crisis is exacerbated by limited access to care and resources. Mobile health (mHealth) platforms using predictive artificial intelligence (AI) can improve access and reduce barriers, enabling real-time responses and precision prevention. This systematic review evaluates predictive AI approaches in mHealth platforms for forecasting mental health symptoms among youth (13–25 years). We searched studies from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and CENTRAL, to identify relevant studies. From 11 studies identified, three studies predicted multiple symptoms, with depression being the most common (63%). Most platforms used smartphones and 25% integrated wearables. Key predictors included smartphone usage (N=5), sleep metrics (N=6), and physical activity (N=5). Nuanced predictors like usage locations and sleep stages improved prediction. Logistic regression was most used (N=6), followed by Support Vector Machines (N=3) and ensemble methods (N=4). F-scores for anxiety and depression ranged from 0.73 to 0.84, and AUCs from 0.50 to 0.74. Stress models had AUCs of 0.68 to 0.83.

Development and validation of an automated machine for self-injury assessment via young Koreans’ natural writings,Kim S.,2025,Plos One,"Self-injury is common in all countries, and 20% of South Korean youths experience self-injury. One of the barriers to assessment and treatment planning is the tendency of young self-injurers to conceal their identities. Following a new stream of research that uses online text data to assess psychological symptoms as they are described in online posts, this study developed a computerized machine that can analyze South Korean self-injurers’ writing in assessing their self-injury severity. Based on 16,645 online posts, Study 1 developed a machine called the Korean Self-Injurious Text Reviewer (K-SITR) using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling and machine learning. The K-SITR’s text-assessment results were statistically indistinguishable from those of professional counselors. Study 2 confirmed the validity of the K-SITR through a survey of 47 young Koreans who had experienced self-injury. Results showed that the K-SITR scores converged with participants’ self-injury frequency and duration and discriminated from other heterogenous factors. The K-SITR also had incremental validity over two popular self-injury questionnaires. This study provides a new measure that may reduce the tendency of young self-injurers to self-conceal compared to traditional direct-item questionnaires.",10.1371/journal.pone.0316619,0,Scopus,85215213830,2-s2.0-85215213830,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215213830
Influencing Factors of Social Anxiety of Undergraduate Nursing Students Based on Random Forest Model: A Cross-Sectional Study,Jia Y.,2025,Nursing Open,"Aim: Social anxiety is common among students, yet research specifically on undergraduate nursing students is scarce. Previous studies have identified various influencing factors but lack a clear ranking of their importance, making it challenging to implement effective intervention strategies with limited resources. This study aims to assess the level of social anxiety in undergraduate nursing students and rank the importance of its influencing factors, providing essential insights for developing efficient and targeted interventions. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 546 undergraduate nursing students in China. Methods: Data were collected via a web-based questionnaire, which included the fear of positive and negative evaluation scale, the self-efficacy scale, and the social anxiety scale. The random forest model was employed to analyse the data and rank the importance of the influencing factors. Results: The total social anxiety score among undergraduate nursing students was 11.20 ± 4.71. Social anxiety had a positive correlation with both fear of positive evaluation (r = 0.521, p < 0.001) and fear of negative evaluation (r = 0.648, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation with self-efficacy (r = −0.273, p < 0.001). According to the random forest model, the top five predictors of social anxiety in this study were fear of negative evaluation, fear of positive evaluation, personality traits, self-efficacy, and academic performance. Conclusion: Attention to social anxiety in undergraduate nursing students is necessary, particularly for those with a higher fear of evaluations, introverted personalities, lower self-efficacy, and poor academic performance. Nursing educators should consider recognising social anxiety and developing personalised interventions tailored to the specific characteristics of these students. Patient or Public Contribution: All participants contributed to the conducting of this study by completing self-reported questionnaires.",10.1002/nop2.70137,2,Scopus,85215109748,2-s2.0-85215109748,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215109748
"MAPPING AFFECTIVE PROFILES IN DEPRESSION, BURNOUT, NORMAL SADNESS, AND EUTHYMIC STATE: A SELF-REPORT SCREENING TOOL DEVELOPED THROUGH A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH",Trofimov D.,2025,Psychiatria Danubina,"Background: Modern post-industrial society is facing a complex of challenges, such as including epidemiological threats, high demands from employers, aggressive forms of corporations’ management, stress at the work place, as well as geopolitical and economic instability worldwide. These factors bring a significant impact on mental health of the general population, contributing to an increased prevalence of mental disorders, particularly, affective states. The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive screening tool based on a self-questionnaire approach for accurate differentiation of affective spectrum state, from preclinical / at-risk to severe clinical conditions. To achieve this goal, we focused on identifying key affective symptoms’ domains and application of machine learning (ML) methods to perform a comprehensive data analysis on classifying the respondents into preclinical and clinical subgroups. Subjects and methods: The study consisted of two stages. At the first stage, we developed and conducted an online survey among the experimental population consisting of university staff and students. This survey version included 19 questions. The study was interrupted to make adjustments. At the second stage, the survey was finalized based on data analysis (descriptive and inferential) and classification tasks. The revised survey was redistributed with additional criteria for inclusion and exclusion of the respondents applied to the study design. The final version contained 34 questions, excluding unreliable questions characterized by p > .05. 381 individuals (269 employees and 112 students) were interviewed, of whom 99 showed signs of depression, normal sadness or emotional burnout. We conducted correlation, descriptive, and inferential analyses and classification of respondents using ML-based methods. Results: The results confirmed the presence of significant differences (p < .001) between the groups with euthymia, normal sadness, emotional burnout and depression. However, there were no statistically significant differences for respondents with a preknown emotional state and for respondents whose condition has been classified using machine learning technologies. The final distribution by category was as follows: euthymia - 38.8%, normal sadness - 27.3%, emotional burnout - 25.2%, depression - 8.7%. Our developed self-report tool has demonstrated statistical benefit, but requires further clinical research to clarify sensitive symptoms’ domains for updating its items content. Conclusions: ML-based analysis of the self-report screening tool-related data demonstrated its sensitivity to classify affective states spectrum onto the separate states of depression, emotional burnout, normal sadness and euthymia (i.e. affective or emotional profiles of the respondents) with 100% accuracy at the final iteration. The problem of assessing mental health lies in the difficulty of obtaining fast, accurate, and emotionally neutral determination of the affective state in individual respondents and across populations. Development of a sensitive self-questionnaire / screening benefits from the the integration of clinical assessments along with the modern ML-based algorithms, as well as targeting the approach that helps to reduce costs and increase the diagnostic accuracy of existing psychometric tools.",,0,Scopus,105016768148,2-s2.0-105016768148,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016768148
Examining worry and secondary stressors on grief severity using machine learning,Uchimura K.K.,2025,Anxiety Stress and Coping,"Background & objectives: Worry and loss-related secondary stressors appear to be important correlates of problematic grief responses. However, the relative importance of these variables in the context of established correlates of grief responding, ranging from indicators of identity disruption and demographic characteristics of the bereaved to characteristics of the loss of quality of the relationship with the deceased, is unknown. Modeling the relative associations of these factors can be problematic, given the high degree of collinearity between these variables. This study used a machine learning approach to provide accurate estimations of the relative importance of these correlates for post-loss symptom severity. Methods and Results: A convenience sample of 428 bereaved people who had lost a parent, spouse, or child in the last 30 to 365 days completed an online survey. Random forest regression modeling examined the effects of worry and secondary stressors on symptom severity in the context of established correlates. Results indicated worry and the number of secondary stressors experienced were among the factors most strongly associated with severity of grief, depression, posttraumatic stress and problems functioning. Conclusions: These results also provide insight into the relative importance of worry and secondary stressors affecting grief severity to guide future research.",10.1080/10615806.2024.2391841,0,Scopus,85201618193,2-s2.0-85201618193,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201618193
Mental Stress Prediction Using Machine Learning and Facial Emotion Recognition,Swedheetha C.,2025,2025 IEEE 14th International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies Csnt 2025,"Stress and mental well-being have emerged as frontline investigation issues in health research. Chronic stress has been proven to affect people’s physical and mental well-being. This paper proposes an integrated model of ML models and CNN to predict stress from the detection of facial emotion. It is designed based on the capabilities of Random Forest and adaptive boosting to evaluate the real-time emotional states of the students, thus keeping in line with the intention of early identification of mental health issues. In particular, the project targets university students for categorizing their academic stress levels either as low, medium, or high through their behavioral and emotional data. This is a CNN model that takes facial expressions and produces emotion categories like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise, and provides real-time insight to the stress levels. The most important features regarding stress levels are discussed at length, like GPA, social support, sleep patterns, and digital behaviors. The results suggest how ML and CNN-based emotion detection can monitor and improve student mental health by managing their stress levels by introducing intervention at an early stage, supportive environments, and personalized coping strategies.",10.1109/CSNT64827.2025.10968217,0,Scopus,105004546141,2-s2.0-105004546141,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004546141
Screening social anxiety with the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System,Ju Q.,2025,Journal of Anxiety Disorders,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder marked by strong fear and avoidance of social scenarios. Early detection of SAD lays the foundation for the introduction of early interventions. However, due to the nature of social avoidance in social anxiety, the screening is challenging in the clinical setting. Classic questionnaires also bear the limitations of subjectivity, memory biases under repeated measures, and cultural influence. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop a reliable and easily accessible tool to be widely used for social anxiety screening. Here, we developed the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS) based on generative multi-modal foundation artificial intelligence (AI) models, containing a total of 279 social pictures and 118 control pictures. Social scenarios were constructed to represent core SAD triggers such as fear of negative evaluation, social interactions, and performance anxiety, mapping to specific dimensions of social anxiety to capture its multifaceted nature. Pictures devoid of social interactions were included as a control, aiming to reveal response patterns specific to social scenarios and to improve the system's precision in predicting social anxiety traits. Through laboratory and online experiments, we collected ratings on SAIPS from five dimensions. Machine learning results showed that ratings on SAIPS robustly reflected and predicted an individual's trait of social anxiety, especially social anxiety and arousal ratings. The prediction was reliable, even based on a short version with less than 30 pictures. Together, SAIPS may serve as a promising tool to support social anxiety screening and longitudinal predictions.",10.1016/j.janxdis.2024.102955,1,Scopus,85211995066,2-s2.0-85211995066,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211995066
Machine Learning based Mental Health Analysis using Social Media Data,Deepika G.,2025,Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems Iciccs 2025,"Social media is a pivotal aspect of modern communication, influencing how individuals connect, share, and engage. This study investigates its effects on mental well-being through the application of sophisticated Machine Learning techniques, including Random Forest (97% accuracy), Decision Tree (91.75% accuracy), XGBoost (95% accuracy), and Naïve Bayes (92% accuracy). By employing sentiment analysis and natural language processing on user-generated content, the research identifies emotional trends, behavior patterns, and early indicators of psychological distress. The findings highlight age-specific tendencies, particularly among teenagers and young adults, where excessive use of social media platforms is linked to heightened risks of anxiety, depression, and isolation, despite the platforms' potential to offer support networks and mental health resources. The investigation proposes AI-driven approaches to encourage balanced social media usage, facilitating early intervention and addressing mental health issues. Thorough validation and independent data analysis confirm the models' reliability, providing valuable insights for mental health experts, policymakers, and platform developers to create user-focused solutions that promote healthier online interactions.",10.1109/ICICCS65191.2025.10984620,0,Scopus,105007523024,2-s2.0-105007523024,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007523024
Digital evolutions: Analysis of self-talk transformation among Generation Z and its impact on counseling services,Mulawarman ,2025,Multidisciplinary Science Journal,"The integration of digital technology into mental health support has significantly influenced Generation Z students, who are highly engaged with online platforms. Innovations such as counseling applications, virtual reality (VR), and AI-based chatbots provide new avenues for managing stress, reducing anxiety, and fostering positive self-talk. Moreover, for Generation Z, who grew up in a technologically advanced world, social media frequently serves as a medium for emotional expression in response to academic and environmental pressures. However, excessive use of social media is increasingly associated with mental health issues, including heightened anxiety and negative self-talk. This qualitative study explores the impact of digital transformation on the self-talk of Generation Z students in Indonesian universities. It aims to (1) identify internal and external factors contributing to changes in self-talk, (2) examine how digital technologies influence these transformations, and (3) evaluate the potential of digital tools in enhancing counseling services. Data were gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews with university students and counselors. Participants shared their experiences with digital platforms, social media, and technology-assisted counseling tools. Thematic analysis revealed that internal factors, including self-reflection, spirituality, and coping strategies, as well as external factors such as academic pressure, social dynamics, family background, economic challenges, and access to counseling services, play significant roles in shaping self-talk. The findings indicate that digital tools, such as VR, AI chatbots, Spotify, and YouTube, contribute positively to emotional regulation and the development of positive self-talk, as they can be utilized as self-help and self-development media. However, overexposure to social media often leads to negative emotional states, such as self criticism, irrational thought, anxiety, and insecurity. This suggests a dual role of digital technology: as both a facilitator and a risk factor in students’ psychological well-being. Educational institutions are advised to leverage digital counseling innovations while promoting digital literacy and mindful use. Further research is needed to investigate the specific effects of various digital platforms and demographic differences on students’ self-talk patterns and overall mental health outcomes.",10.31893/multiscience.2026225,0,Scopus,105016667006,2-s2.0-105016667006,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016667006
"Trends in anti-diabetic medication use, severe hyperglycaemia and severe hypoglycaemia among American Indian and Alaska Native Peoples, 2009–2013",Dai J.,2025,Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism,"Aims: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications disproportionally affect American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples. Prescribing decisions for anti-diabetic medications are complicated and require balancing medication benefits, costs and side effects. Little is known about trends in anti-diabetic medication use as well as acute diabetes complications among AI/AN adults. Here, we examined patterns and trends in anti-diabetic medication use and rates of hospital admissions or emergency department (ED) visits due to severe hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia among AI/AN adults with T2D. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of Indian Health Service (IHS) Improving Health Care Delivery Data Project. A total of 39 183 AI/AN adults aged ≥18 years with T2D who used IHS or Tribal health services during any of the fiscal years (FYs) 2009–2013 were included. Utilization rates of each class of anti-diabetic medications and rates of severe hypoglycaemia and severe hyperglycaemia in emergency room and/or inpatient discharge diagnoses were calculated for each year. Longitudinal statistical models were fitted to examine time trends of anti-diabetic medication use and complications. Results: During 2009–2013, use of metformin (56.0%–60.5%), insulin (31.4%–35.9%) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (1.4%–9.0%) increased, whereas the use of sulfonylureas (40.3%–32.9%) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs, 31.6%–8.8%) decreased significantly. Trends in severe hypoglycaemia (1.6%–0.8%) and severe hyperglycaemia (2.0%–1.6%) declined gradually. Conclusions: There were significant changes in the utilization of different anti-diabetic medication classes during 2009–2013 among AI/AN adults with T2D.

Design and Baseline Evaluation of Social Media Vaping Prevention Trial: Randomized Controlled Trial Study,Evans W.D.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is a major public health problem and young adults aged 18-24 years are at high risk. Furthermore, oral nicotine products (ONPs) are growing in popularity in this population. Poly-use is widespread. New methodologies for rigorous online studies using social media have been conducted and shown to reduce nicotine use. Objective: We report on the design and baseline evaluation of a large-scale social media-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of antivaping social media on young adult vaping and determinants of use. Methods: Using the Virtual Lab social media platform, participants were recruited using an artificial intelligence chatbot and social media advertising, completed a baseline survey, and were randomized to 1 of 4 study arms. The design was to achieve specific numbers of impressions per arm over 3 survey time points. We recruited 8437 participants, stratified by vaper (n=5026) and nonvaper (n=3321) status. Questionnaire data were collected using the Qualtrics survey platform. Future analyses will examine the effects of social media content on vaping at the endline. Our data analysis describes the 2 cohort samples, examines balance across the 4 study arms on baseline variables in each of the cohorts, and evaluates the internal consistency of several multi-indicator measures of psychosocial constructs. Results: Among vapers, almost three-fourths were current vapers, >40% were current smokers (using in the past 30 days), and >48% were current poly-users (using e-cigarettes and ≥1 other tobacco products). Substantial numbers of current vapers also currently use some other product, including cigars (n=1520, 30.2%), hookah (n=794, 15.8%), smokeless devices (n=462, 9.2%), and ONPs (n=578, 11.5%). The average age of participants was 21.2 (SD 2) years. Just less than 45% of participants were non-Hispanic White (n=3728, 44.7%), just less than 47% (n=3913, 46.9%) of the sample was male, more than 44% (n=3704, 44.4%) reported completing high school, and 79.3% reported meeting basic needs or better. There were no significant differences between arms and strata by any of these demographics. We calculated scale scores for depression and covariates related to nicotine use and found high alphas. Finally, participants who reported having seen antitobacco brand advertising were more likely to have higher levels of these variables and scales than participants who reported not having seen the advertisements. These results will be examined in future studies. Conclusions: Social media can be used as a platform at scale for longitudinal randomized controlled trials over extended periods, which extends previous research on short-term trials. Interventions delivered by social media can be used with large samples to evaluate social media health behavior change interventions. Future studies based on this research will evaluate the intervention and dose-response effects of social media exposure on vaping behavior and determinants.",10.2196/72002,1,Scopus,105001675835,2-s2.0-105001675835,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001675835

Development and Validation of the Digital Sensitivity Scale for Adults: Cross-Sectional Observational Study,Park H.I.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of modern society, extending digital transformation to daily life and psychological evaluation and treatment. However, the development of competencies and literacy in handling digital technology has not kept pace, resulting in a significant disparity among individuals. Existing measurements of digital literacy were developed before widespread information and communications technology device adoption, mainly focusing on one’s perceptions of their proficiency and the utility of device operation. In the contemporary landscape, digital transformation is evolving within specialized domains, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of digital competencies, attitudes, and proficiency in technology application to bridge the digital divide and ensure digital compliance. Objective: This study was designed to address the shortcomings of existing scales and formulate a digital sensitivity scale tailored to the requirements of today’s society. Methods: Initial items of the Yongin Severance Digital Sensitivity Scale (YI-DSS) were collected through a literature review, and expert opinions were gathered to ensure content validity. An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis included 986 adult participants evaluating 14 digital literacy items and 6 digital efficacy items. The Cronbach α confirmed internal consistency reliability, and 2-tailed t tests, ANOVAs, and post hoc tests analyzed demographic differences in digital literacy and efficacy. Results: A robust 4-factor digital literacy solution was identified: digital application, digital communication, critical thinking, and digital ethics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.891; Bartlett × 2=9829.713; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.782-0.947). A 2-factor solution defined digital efficacy: digital confidence and digital anxiety (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.735; Bartlett × 2=3282.217; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.787-0.912). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for each model (digital literacy model: χ<sup>2</sup><inf>71</inf>=676.0, comparative fit index=0.938, Tucker-Lewis index=0.921, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.093; digital efficacy model: χ<sup>2</sup><inf>8</inf>=81.9, comparative fit index=0.977, Tucker-Lewis index=0.958, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.097), which indicated a good fit. The YI-DSS also showed high correlation with the previously developed Digital Literacy Scale (r=0.809; P<.001). Conclusions: The YI-DSS, as a self-assessment tool, has the potential to bridge the generational information gap by promoting acceptance, motivation, and adaptation to digital technology. Furthermore, given the remote nature of digital therapeutics, an individual’s familiarity with required technologies and digital communication strongly influences their acceptance of digital treatments and the efficacy thereof. This scale can play a pivotal role in enhancing compliance with digital therapeutics by preemptively assessing individuals’ technological literacy and competency.",10.2196/55828,0,Scopus,85214902123,2-s2.0-85214902123,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214902123
Trust and Acceptance Challenges in the Adoption of AI Applications in Health Care: Quantitative Survey Analysis,Kauttonen J.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has potential to transform health care, but its successful implementation depends on the trust and acceptance of consumers and patients. Understanding the factors that influence attitudes toward AI is crucial for effective adoption. Despite AI’s growing integration into health care, consumer and patient acceptance remains a critical challenge. Research has largely focused on applications or attitudes, lacking a comprehensive analysis of how factors, such as demographics, personality traits, technology attitudes, and AI knowledge, affect and interact across different health care AI contexts. Objective: We aimed to investigate people’s trust in and acceptance of AI across health care use cases and determine how context and perceived risk affect individuals’ propensity to trust and accept AI in specific health care scenarios. Methods: We collected and analyzed web-based survey data from 1100 Finnish participants, presenting them with 8 AI use cases in health care: 5 (62%) noninvasive applications (eg, activity monitoring and mental health support) and 3 (38%) physical interventions (eg, AI-controlled robotic surgery). Respondents evaluated intention to use, trust, and willingness to trade off personal data for these use cases. Gradient boosted tree regression models were trained to predict responses based on 33 demographic-, personality-, and technology-related variables. To interpret the results of our predictive models, we used the Shapley additive explanations method, a game theory–based approach for explaining the output of machine learning models. It quantifies the contribution of each feature to individual predictions, allowing us to determine the relative importance of various demographic-, personality-, and technology-related factors and their interactions in shaping participants’ trust in and acceptance of AI in health care. Results: Consumer attitudes toward technology, technology use, and personality traits were the primary drivers of trust and intention to use AI in health care. Use cases were ranked by acceptance, with noninvasive monitors being the most preferred. However, the specific use case had less impact in general than expected. Nonlinear dependencies were observed, including an inverted U-shaped pattern in positivity toward AI based on self-reported AI knowledge. Certain personality traits, such as being more disorganized and careless, were associated with more positive attitudes toward AI in health care. Women seemed more cautious about AI applications in health care than men. Conclusions: The findings highlight the complex interplay of factors influencing trust and acceptance of AI in health care. Consumer trust and intention to use AI in health care are driven by technology attitudes and use rather than specific use cases. AI service providers should consider demographic factors, personality traits, and technology attitudes when designing and implementing AI systems in health care. The study demonstrates the potential of using predictive AI models as decision-making tools for implementing and interacting with clients in health care AI applications.",10.2196/65567,4,Scopus,105001296976,2-s2.0-105001296976,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001296976
The Immediate Impact of App-Based Psychotherapeutic Exercises on Anxiety: An RCT,Sandkühler J.F.,2025,Depression and Anxiety,"Background: Despite the growing integrative trend in psychotherapy, few studies have examined the potential for immediate anxiety relief of many different psychotherapeutic exercises side by side under the same conditions. This information might be important to enhance engagement and self-efficacy, stop negative feedback loops, and prevent avoidant or destructive behavior during crises. Technology-based psychotherapeutic exercises are of particular interest because they are accessible and scalable. Methods: This parallel, double-blind, randomized trial (N = 1092) compared 12 psychotherapeutic exercises of the Mind Ease app against a reading control and a measurement-only control. Efficacy was measured with a custom scale validated against the state subscale of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: Each of the 12 exercises significantly reduced anxiety more than controls (p = 0.018 to <0.001, η<sup>2</sup><inf>p</inf> = 0.06 to 0.37, d = 0.5 to 1.5, d [95% CI] for all exercises together vs. reading control = 0.8 [0.6; 1.0], and vs. measurement-only control = 0.8 [0.6; 1.0]). Exercises employing cognitive restructuring had effect sizes d [95% CI] of 0.5 [0.2; 0.8], 0.7 [0.3; 1.0], and 0.9 [0.6; 1.2], diaphragmatic breathing of 0.6 [0.3; 0.9], gratitude practice of 0.8 [0.5; 1.1], positive expressive writing of 1.1 [0.7; 1.4], progressive muscle relaxation of 1.3 [0.9; 1.6], guided imagery of 1.3 [1.0; 1.6], and mindfulness of 0.9 [0.6; 1.2], 1.0 [0.7; 1.3], 1.2 [0.9; 1.5], and 1.5 [1.2; 1.9]. Twenty-eight comparisons between exercises (42%) had p < 0.05, nine met the Bonferroni-adjusted threshold of p < 0.0008. Conclusions: The 12 psychotherapeutic exercises proved effective at immediately mitigating anxiety. Differences between exercises were substantial even within categories. Mindfulness tended to have a larger effect than cognitive restructuring.

"“Un amigo secreto”: perceived acceptability of a chatbot for depression education, self-help and linkage to care among adolescents living with HIV in Peru",Rupani N.,2025,AIDS Care Psychological and Socio Medical Aspects of AIDS HIV,"Adolescents living with HIV (ALWH) in Peru face significant mental health challenges, including a high prevalence of depression, exacerbated by limited access to mental health resources. This study explores the perceived acceptability of chatbots to support depression education, self-care, and referral among ALWH. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with 28 adolescents, 5 caregivers, and 5 HIV care personnel. A semi-structured interview guide assessed seven core chatbot acceptability constructs: affective attitude, ethics, burden, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy. Most participants expressed positive attitudes towards a potential mental health chatbot, highlighting the possibilities it could offer as a non-threatening and accessible source of information and support, offering immediate responses and facilitating a safe space for ALWH to communicate their needs in moments of isolation. Participants understood a potential chatbot's three main purposes and had confidence in their abilities to use one successfully. However, concerns were raised regarding a potential chatbot's inability to provide human empathy and potential privacy issues related to data security. Despite some reservations, participants generally believed that chatbots could effectively deliver educational content, promote self-help strategies, and serve as a bridge to professional care.",10.1080/09540121.2025.2518731,0,Scopus,105012424964,2-s2.0-105012424964,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012424964
Evaluation of a Guided Chatbot Intervention for Young People in Jordan: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,de Graaff A.M.,2025,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Depression and anxiety are a leading cause of disability worldwide and often start during adolescence and young adulthood. The majority of young people live in low- and middle-income countries where there is a lack of mental health services. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a guided, nonartificial intelligence chatbot intervention called Scalable Technology for Adolescents and youth to Reduce Stress (STARS) to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety among young people affected by adversity. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the STARS intervention and study procedures among young people in Jordan. Methods: A 2-arm, single-blind, feasibility randomized controlled trial was conducted among 60 young people aged 18 years to 21 years living in Jordan with self-reported elevated levels of psychological distress. Immediately after baseline, participants were randomized 1:1 into the STARS intervention or enhanced care as usual (ECAU). STARS consisted of 10 lessons in which participants interacted with a chatbot and learned several cognitive behavioral therapy strategies, with optional guidance by a trained e-helper through 5 weekly phone calls. ECAU consisted of a static web page providing basic psychoeducation. Online questionnaires were administered at baseline (week 0) and postassessment (week 8) to assess depression (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 [HSCL-25]), anxiety (HSCL-25), functional impairment (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS] 2.0), psychological well-being (WHO-Five Well-Being Index [WHO-5]), and agency (State Hope Scale). Process evaluation interviews with stakeholders were conducted after the postassessment. Results: Participants were recruited in December 2022 and January 2023. Of 700 screening website visits, 160 participants were eligible, and 60 participants (mean age 19.7, SD 1.16 years; 49/60, 82% female) continued to baseline and were randomized into STARS (n=30) or ECAU (n=30). Of those who received STARS, 37% (11/30) completed at least 8 chatbot lessons, and 13% (4/30) completed all 5 support calls. The research protocol functioned well in terms of balanced randomization, high retention at postassessment (48/60, 80%), and good psychometric properties of the online questionnaires. Process evaluation interviews with STARS participants, ECAU participants, e-helpers, and the clinical supervisor indicated the acceptability of the study procedures and the STARS and ECAU conditions and highlighted several aspects that could be improved, including the e-helper support and features of the STARS chatbot. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the STARS intervention and research procedures. A fully powered, definitive randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of STARS.",10.2196/63515,3,Scopus,105000339489,2-s2.0-105000339489,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000339489
MRI quantified enlarged perivascular space volumes as imaging biomarkers correlating with severity of anxiety depression in young adults with long-time mobile phone use,Li L.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: Long-time mobile phone use (LTMPU) has been linked to emotional issues such as anxiety and depression while the enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), as marker of neuroinflammation, is closely related with mental disorders. In the current study, we aim to develop a predictive model utilizing MRI-quantified EPVS metrics and machine learning algorithms to assess the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with LTMPU. Methods: Eighty-two participants with LTMPU were included, with 37 suffering from anxiety and 44 suffering from depression. Deep learning algorithms were used to segment EPVS lesions and extract quantitative metrics. Comparison and correlation analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between EPVS and self-reported mood states. Training and testing datasets were randomly assigned in the ratio of 8:2 to perform radiomics analysis, where EPVS metrics combined with sex and age were used to select the most valuable features to construct machine learning models for predicting the severity of anxiety and depression. Results: Several EPVS features were significantly different between the two comparisons. For classifying anxiety status, eight features were selected to construct a logistic regression model, with an AUC of 0.819 (95%CI 0.573-1.000) in the testing dataset. For classifying depression status, eight features were selected to construct a K nearest neighbors model with an AUC value of 0.931 (95%CI 0.814-1.000) in the testing dataset. Discussion: The utilization of MRI-quantified EPVS metrics combined with machine-learning algorithms presents a promising method for evaluating severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with LTMPU, which might introduce a non-invasive, objective, and quantitative approach to enhance diagnostic efficiency and guide personalized treatment strategies.",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1532256,0,Scopus,86000117880,2-s2.0-86000117880,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000117880
The Effectiveness of a Chatbot Single-Session Intervention for People on Waitlists for Eating Disorder Treatment: Randomized Controlled Trial,Sharp G.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Early treatment is critical for improving eating disorder prognosis. Single-session interventions (SSIs) can provide short-term support to people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment; however, it is not always possible to access SSIs. We co-designed and developed a rule-based chatbot called ED ESSI (Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention), which delivered an SSI and demonstrated its acceptability and feasibility. However, the effectiveness of ED ESSI is yet to be investigated. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an SSI delivered by ED ESSI. We examined the chatbot’s impact on eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, stress, and motivation for change or treatment in individuals aged ≥16 years on waitlists for treatment for all types of eating disorders. Methods: This multicenter 2-armed randomized controlled trial included 60 people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment in the chatbot intervention group (n=30, 50%) or the control group (n=30, 50%). The ED ESSI chatbot guided participants through a 30-minute SSI of assessment and psychoeducation, while the control group received web-based information on the same core topics covered in the SSI. There were 4 time points: before intervention or baseline (time point 1 [T1]), after intervention within 72 hours of baseline (T2), 1 month after baseline (T3), and 3 months after baseline (T4). Eating disorder pathology (primary outcome) and psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcomes) were measured at T1, T3, and T4, and motivation for change or treatment (secondary outcome) was measured at all 4 time points. Furthermore, the System Usability Scale was implemented at T2 for the chatbot intervention group only. Results: ED ESSI induced significantly greater reductions compared to the control group in the primary outcome of eating disorder pathology (P=.003) and secondary outcomes of psychosocial impairment (P=.008), depression (P=.002), and anxiety (P=.040) over the 1- and 3-month time points, with small to moderate effects (Cohen d=0.15-0.53). Chatbot use also induced an increase in participants’ confidence in their ability to change (secondary outcome) immediately after use (T2), with a moderate effect (P<.001; Cohen d=0.74). The chatbot was rated as “excellent” in terms of usability. A significantly higher proportion of participants in the chatbot group (28/30, 93%) entered treatment by 3 months upon the opportunity being offered to them, compared to the control group, with a moderate effect (21/30, 70%; P=.042; ϕ=0.30). Conclusions: ED ESSI promptly induced improvements in eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, and anxiety, which were detectable at 1 month and maintained to 3 months. ED ESSI potentially represents an effective, accessible, and scalable form of early intervention for people aged ≥16 years waiting for eating disorder treatment. Further research is needed to determine the longer-term effectiveness of ED ESSI.",10.2196/70874,3,Scopus,105006454493,2-s2.0-105006454493,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006454493
Safety and User Experience of a Generative Artificial Intelligence Digital Mental Health Intervention: Exploratory Randomized Controlled Trial,Campellone T.R.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: General awareness and exposure to generative artificial intelligence (AI) have increased recently. This transformative technology has the potential to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience in digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). However, if not appropriately used and controlled, it can introduce risks to users that may result in harm and erode trust. At the time of conducting this trial, there had not been a rigorous evaluation of an approach to safely implementing generative AI in a DMHI. Objective: This study aims to explore the user relationship, experience, safety, and technical guardrails of a DMHI using generative AI compared with a rules-based intervention. Methods: We conducted a 2-week exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 160 adult participants randomized to receive a generative AI (n=81) or rules-based (n=79) version of a conversation-based DMHI. Self-report measures of the user relationship (client satisfaction, working alliance bond, and accuracy of empathic listening and reflection) and experience (engagement metrics, adverse events, and technical guardrail success) were collected. Descriptions and validation of technical guardrails for handling user inputs (eg, detecting potentially concerning language and off-topic responses) and model outputs (eg, not providing medical advice and not providing a diagnosis) are provided, along with examples to illustrate how they worked. Safety monitoring was conducted throughout the trial for adverse events, and the success of technical guardrails created for the generative arm was assessed post trial. Results: In general, the majority of measures of user relationship and experience appeared to be similar in both the generative and rules-based arms. The generative arm appeared to be more accurate at detecting and responding to user statements with empathy (98% accuracy vs 69%). There were no serious or device-related adverse events, and technical guardrails were shown to be 100% successful in posttrial review of generated statements. A majority of participants in both groups reported an increase in positive sentiment (62% and 66%) about AI at the end of the trial. Conclusions: This trial provides initial evidence that, with the right guardrails and process, generative AI can be successfully used in a digital mental health intervention (DMHI) while maintaining the user experience and relationship. It also provides an initial blueprint for approaches to technical and conversational guardrails that can be replicated to build a safe DMHI.",10.2196/67365,0,Scopus,105005794114,2-s2.0-105005794114,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005794114
"Assessing the Uses, Benefits, and Limitations of Digital Technologies Used by Health Professionals in Supporting Obesity and Mental Health Communication: Scoping Review",Kearns A.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Obesity and mental health issues present interconnected public health challenges that impair physical, social, and mental well-being. Digital technologies offer potential for enhancing health care communication between health professionals (HPs) and individuals living with obesity and mental health issues, but their effectiveness is not fully understood. Objective: This scoping review aims to identify and understand the different types of technologies used by HPs in supporting obesity and mental health communication. Methods: A comprehensive scoping review, which followed a validated methodology, analyzed studies published between 2013 and 2023 across 8 databases. The data extraction focused on HPs’ use of communication technologies, intervention types, biopsychosocial considerations, and perceptions of technology use. The review was guided by the following research question: “What are the uses, benefits, and limitations of digital technologies in supporting communication between HPs and persons living with obesity and mental health issues?” Results: In total, 8 studies—featuring web-based platforms, social media, synchronous video calls, telephone calls, automated SMS text messaging, and email—met the inclusion criteria. Technologies such as virtual learning collaborative dashboards and videoconferencing, supported by automated SMS text messaging and social media (Facebook and WhatsApp groups), were commonly used. Psychologists, dietitians, social workers, and health coaches used digital tools to facilitate virtual appointments, diet and mental health monitoring, and motivational and educational support through group therapy, 1-on-1 sessions, and hybrid models. Benefits included enhanced access to care and engagement, personalized digital cognitive behavioral therapy, perceived stigma reduction, privacy, and improved physical health outcomes in weight reduction. However, improvements in mental health outcomes were not statistically significant in studies reporting P values (P≥.05). The limitations included engagement difficulties due to conflicting personal family and work commitments; variable communication mode preferences, with some preferring in-person sessions; and misinterpretations of SMS text messaging prompts. Conflicts arose from cultural and individual differences, weight stigma, and confusion over HP roles in obesity and mental health care. Conclusions: Digital technologies have diversified the approaches HPs can take in delivering education, counseling, and motivation to individuals with obesity and mental health issues, facilitating private, stigma-reduced environments for personalized care. While the interventions were effective in obesity management, the review revealed a shortfall in addressing mental health needs. This highlights an urgent need for digital tools to serve as media for a deeper engagement with individuals’ complex biopsychosocial needs. The integration of data science and technological advancements offers promising avenues for tailored digital solutions. The findings advocate the importance of continued innovation and adaptation in digital health care communication strategies, with clearer HP roles and an interdisciplinary, empathetic approach focused on individual needs.",10.2196/58434,3,Scopus,85217412757,2-s2.0-85217412757,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217412757
Real-world effectiveness of cariprazine in major depressive disorder and bipolar I disorder in the United States,McIntyre R.S.,2025,Journal of Medical Economics,"Aims: The efficacy of cariprazine for major depressive disorder (MDD) (adjunctive therapy) and bipolar I (BP-I) depression has been demonstrated in clinical trials. This study evaluated the real-world effectiveness of cariprazine in reducing depression severity among patients with moderate-to-severe MDD or BP-I depression. Methods: Medical/pharmacy claims and electronic medical records (EMRs) from specialty providers in the OM1 Real-World Data Cloud were used to identify adults with MDD or BP-I who initiated cariprazine (adjunctively for MDD) (first dispensing = index) and had ≥1 EMR and ≥1 claim during 12-month baseline and ≤12-month follow-up periods. Included patients had a baseline Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 total score ≥10, reflecting at least moderate depressive symptoms. Follow-up continued until cariprazine discontinuation, alternate diagnosis (e.g. BP-I [MDD cohort] or MDD [BP-I cohort]), or 12 months post-index. Depression severity was assessed using PHQ-9 total scores that were observed or estimated from clinical notes using a previously validated machine learning algorithm. Analyses included mean change in PHQ-9 score from baseline to 2, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. A sensitivity analysis using only observed PHQ-9 scores was conducted. Results: Of 754 patients at baseline, 396 had MDD (mean PHQ-9 = 16.4) and 358 had BP-I (mean PHQ-9 = 16.9). For patients with MDD, mean reductions in PHQ-9 scores from baseline to 2, 6, and 12 months of adjunctive cariprazine treatment were 3.5 (95% CI: 2.7, 4.4; n = 127), 4.1 (2.9, 5.4; n = 87), and 3.7 (1.6, 5.8; n = 52), respectively. For patients with BP-I, mean reductions from baseline to 2, 6, and 12 months were 5.2 (95% CI: 4.2, 6.2; n = 121), 6.5 (5.2, 7.8; n = 90), and 6.9 (5.2, 8.5; n = 54), respectively. Greater improvements were observed in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: This real-world effectiveness study of cariprazine treatment for MDD (adjunctive use) or BP-I demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained improvement in depression symptoms during short- and long-term follow-up.",10.1080/13696998.2025.2513766,2,Scopus,105007655724,2-s2.0-105007655724,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007655724
"Design, development, and evaluation of an mHealth app to reduce stress and promote happiness through smiling",Orji J.,2025,Behaviour and Information Technology,"The field of mental health application research is growing, yet comprehensive, long-term studies validating claims of stress reduction and mood enhancement are limited, with many apps lacking empirical evidence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an mHealth application called SmileApp to promote positive mood as a means of reducing stress. The design of SmileApp is grounded in psychological theories and integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and persuasive technology (PT). To evaluate SmileApp, we conducted a two-week in-the-wild study involving 72 participants. This was followed by an optional semi-structured interview with 23 participants. Quantitative results suggest that SmileApp is usable, useful, and encourages users to smile more frequently. Furthermore, qualitative results suggest that SmileApp was a unique design to help users alleviate stress. These results offer valuable insights into innovative approaches for designing mHealth applications that promote positive mood. Moreover, the findings underscore the importance of utilising technology to support emotional well-being. We present a novel approach to promote desired behaviours by motivating users to read supportive messages and playing mobile games through the act of smiling.",10.1080/0144929X.2025.2494278,1,Scopus,105004046624,2-s2.0-105004046624,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004046624

Recruiting Young People for Digital Mental Health Research: Lessons From an AI-Driven Adaptive Trial,Zheng W.Y.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: With increasing adoption of remote clinical trials in digital mental health, identifying cost-effective and time-efficient recruitment methodologies is crucial for the success of such trials. Evidence on whether web-based recruitment methods are more effective than traditional methods such as newspapers, media, or flyers is inconsistent. Here we present insights from our experience recruiting tertiary education students for a digital mental health artificial intelligence–driven adaptive trial—Vibe Up. Objective: We evaluated the effectiveness of recruitment via Facebook and Instagram compared to traditional methods for a treatment trial and compared different recruitment methods’ retention rates. With recruitment coinciding with COVID-19 lockdowns across Australia, we also compared the cost-effectiveness of social media recruitment during and after lockdowns. Methods: Recruitment was completed for 2 pilot trials and 6 minitrials from June 2021 to May 2022. To recruit participants, paid social media advertising on Facebook and Instagram was used, alongside mailing lists of university networks and student organizations or services, media releases, announcements during classes and events, study posters or flyers on university campuses, and health professional networks. Recruitment data, including engagement metrics collected by Meta (Facebook and Instagram), advertising costs, and Qualtrics data on recruitment methods and survey completion rates, were analyzed using RStudio with R (version 3.6.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Results: In total, 1314 eligible participants (aged 22.79, SD 4.71 years; 1079, 82.1% female) were recruited to 2 pilot trials and 6 minitrials. The vast majority were recruited via Facebook and Instagram advertising (n=1203; 92%). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the lead institution’s website was more effective in recruiting eligible participants than Facebook (z=3.47; P=.003) and Instagram (z=4.23; P<.001). No differences were found between recruitment methods in retaining participants at baseline, at midpoint, and at study completion. Wilcoxon tests found significant differences between lockdown (pilot 1 and pilot 2) and postlockdown (minitrials 1-6) on costs incurred per link click (lockdown: median Aus $0.35 [US $0.22], IQR Aus $0.27-$0.47 [US $0.17-$0.29]; postlockdown: median Aus $1.00 [US $0.62], IQR Aus $0.70-$1.47 [US $0.44-$0.92]; W=9087; P<.001) and the amount spent per hour to reach the target sample size (lockdown: median Aus $4.75 [US $2.95], IQR Aus $1.94-6.34 [US $1.22-$3.97]; postlockdown: median Aus $13.29 [US $8.26], IQR Aus $4.70-25.31 [US $2.95-$15.87]; W=16044; P<.001). Conclusions: Social media advertising via Facebook and Instagram was the most successful strategy for recruiting distressed tertiary students into this artificial intelligence–driven adaptive trial, providing evidence for the use of this recruitment method for this type of trial in digital mental health research. No recruitment method stood out in terms of participant retention. Perhaps a reflection of the added distress experienced by young people, social media recruitment during the COVID-19 lockdown period was more cost-effective.",10.2196/60413,1,Scopus,85215131240,2-s2.0-85215131240,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215131240
Social Media Content and Suicidality: Implications for Practice,Vongtangton P.,2025,Psychological Services,"Artificial intelligence is a useful tool for examining suicidality on social media, where people share their thoughts. However, existing research has primarily focused on text analysis to predict risk in single posts and raised privacy concerns. This study aimed to use text, images, and user features on Instagram to predict the risk of each user in Hawaii with user permission. One hundred forty-two participants completed online questionnaires about their current suicidal ideation. With their consent, their Instagram data were collected to train Artificial intelligence model to predict suicidal ideation of each user. Thirty-three (23.2%) participants reported having current suicidal ideation. The best model predicts suicidal ideation with 52% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 65% positive predictive value, and 82% accuracy. The significant predictors were negative description, lower hue and more red in an image, fewer nature and sky images, more art, fashion, a close-up of a body part, and spoof content in an image. These findings highlight the potential of suicide prediction on social media, which help mental health providers plan patient online interventions and appointments. Additionally, the influence of Hawaii’s unique social-cultural context on significant predictors, helping gatekeepers to recognize signs of suicide on the social media of people in Hawaii.",10.1037/ser0000948,0,Scopus,105000410818,2-s2.0-105000410818,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000410818
Social Stratification and the Influence of Financial Literacy on Student Social Interaction within AI Technologically Enhanced Learning Environments: An Examination from a Sociological Lens,Yakin A.A.,2025,Cutting Edge Solutions for Advancing Sustainable Development Exploring Technological Horizons for Sustainability Part 2,"Social interaction plays an important role in the learning process in higher education. Interactions with peers, professors, and other members of the academic community contribute to students' cognitive and social development. Collaborative learning environments foster critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and the exchange of diverse perspectives, thereby enriching the overall learning experience. Additionally, social interactions using AI technology can provide emotional support, motivation, and a sense of belonging, which are important for academic success and mental well-being in the learning process. However, in the Indonesian context, socioeconomic disparities and social inequality can worsen social interactions when using AI in the learning process. Students from marginalised communities or disadvantaged backgrounds may face additional barriers to academic success, including limited access to educational resources, educational media and technology, discrimination, and social exclusion. These challenges can hinder their ability to fully engage in the learning process and reach their academic potential. This study aims to examine the opinions of students in higher education regarding the direct and indirect influence of financial education literacy and social status, as well as the impact of social interaction using AI on learning in higher education. The population of this research is Al Asyariah Mandar University students’ class of 2023, with a population of 219 students. We randomly selected 109 students as the sample. The instruments used were observations andquesti- onnaires, which were processed using IBM 26-version statistics. The data results show that, from a sociological perspective, the influence of economic status and social interaction on the learning process in higher education in Indonesia is a complex problem with many aspects. Economic status often determines access to educational resources, such as the availability of smartphones and quotas to access AI applications for learning, as well as the choice of quality universities, tutoring, and educational materials. Survey results show that although students with higher economic backgrounds have access to better educational opportunities, in class they are required to share with classmates who do not have laptops or smartphones. Lecturers determine group division based on existing resources, including tutoring, private, and enrichment educational programmes within the AI learning environment for students who are falling behind, which can have a positive impact on their academic performance. Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, on the other hand, may face financial constraints that limit their access to educational resources, educational media, and technology, potentially hindering their academic success, but they are highly motivated to learn and actively engaged throughout the learning process through AI technology in university. This research contributes to addressing the impact of economic status and social interactions using AI on the learning process in higher education with a comprehensive approach that recognises and addresses underlying social inequalities, including the implementation of policies in higher education and programmes aimed at reducing socio-economic disparities, and providing fair access. to educational resources, fostering inclusive learning environments, and developing supportive social networks within educational institutions that create a more equitable and conducive learning environment for all students, regardless of economic background or social status.",10.2174/9789815322408125010007,0,Scopus,105006859371,2-s2.0-105006859371,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006859371
"Exploring the Perspectives of Pediatric Health Care Providers, Youth Patients, and Caregivers on Machine Learning Suicide Risk Classification: Mixed Methods Study",Dayal R.R.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Suicide was the second leading cause of death for youth aged between 10 and 24 years in 2023, necessitating improved risk identification to better identify those in need of support. While machine learning (ML) applied to electronic health records shows promise in improving risk identification, further research on the perspectives of these tools is needed to better inform implementation strategies. Objective: These findings incorporate 2 studies aimed to explore patient, caregiver, and pediatric health care provider perspectives on suicide risk models and associated clinical practices. We sought to use these findings to inform the design and implementation of a suicide risk model and associated clinical workflow to improve the quality of care provided to at-risk youth. Methods: We conducted a convergent mixed methods study to evaluate pediatric provider perspectives by quantitatively surveying and qualitatively interviewing provider participants. The provider study was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, and data were analyzed descriptively and using a template analysis for quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Qualitative interviews conducted among youth patients and caregivers as part of a sequential mixed methods study, guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability, were analyzed using template analysis as well. The integration of quantitative and qualitative data was achieved through a joint display, and results were interpreted through a narrative review. Results: Forty-five providers completed the first section of the survey (risk model clinical preferences), while 44 completed the second section (risk model usability perspectives) and 38 completed the third section (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research barriers and facilitators). Eight pediatric providers were interviewed. Ten semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted among 9 patient participants aged between 8 and 25 years and 1 caregiver. Overall, providers, patients, and caregivers expressed interest in applying ML methods to improve suicide risk identification. Providers felt that these tools could address current challenges in suicide-related care, such as inadequacies in manual suicide screeners or communication across care teams. Patients and caregivers saw potential for these tools to facilitate discussions regarding suicide and promote early intervention for patients who might otherwise be missed by current care practices. However, providers also expressed concerns about increased demand for mental health services, implications for patient confidentiality,coercive care, inaccurate diagnosis and response, and medical-legal liability. Ethical concerns shared by patients and caregivers spanned data safety practices and privacy regulations, respect for patient autonomy and informed consent, and decreased future health care engagement due to poor implementation. Conclusions: There is conditional acceptability and enthusiasm among providers, patients, and caregivers for ML-based suicide risk models. Successful implementation requires the incorporation of provider perspectives in a user-led fashion to build trust and empower clinicians to respond appropriately to risk flags, while upholding youth and caregiver perspectives to adequately accommodate patient needs.",10.2196/57602,0,Scopus,105013495704,2-s2.0-105013495704,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013495704
Artificial intelligence addiction: exploring the emerging phenomenon of addiction in the AI age,Al-Obaydi L.H.,2025,AI and Society,"This comprehensive scoping review looks at how AI addiction could be spread among AI users. It evaluates prior research on AI addiction using different applications, with an emphasis on improving the well-being of users. The research questions explored in this review focus on the description of the frameworks, the target samples, the research methods, and research findings related to the topic of AI addiction. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) is the methodology employed to identify and analyze relevant research articles. This scoping review concentrates on little but diverse global 14 studies between 2020 and 2025. The results demonstrate that research on AI addiction has addressed issues like the definition of AI addiction, the potential causes of AI addiction that directly impact researchers, how students have become overly dependent on generative chatbots in the classroom, how teachers heavily rely on generative AI, the responsible role of AI designers, online instruction, how generative chatbot addiction significantly reduced social media addiction, the impact of generative AI on older adults, and, finally, how loneliness and reliance on short-form videos moderate the relationship between narcissism and sincere self-disclosure to AI. It also show the main factors that lead to AI addiction such as innate desire for competence and relatedness, the role of designs and emotional attachment, in addition to exaggeration of using AI. The findings further show that the majority of AI engagement is motivated by functional needs like cognitive immersion and perceived utility, even though emotional over-use of generative AI might occasionally resemble behavioral addiction. Finally, the findings demonstrate that the samples include children, teenagers, elderly people, college students, teachers, experienced users, and researchers. Based on the results obtained, some pedagogical implications are put forward. Finally, collaboration between researchers, legislators, educators, and tech developers can guarantee the development of moral AI systems that put the welfare of users first.",10.1007/s00146-025-02535-z,1,Scopus,105012315513,2-s2.0-105012315513,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012315513
Using Social Media to Recruit a Diverse Sample of Participants for a Mobile Health (mHealth) Intervention to Increase Physical Activity: Exploratory Study,Pathak L.,2025,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Recruitment of demographically diverse samples in clinical research is often challenging and even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional in-person recruitment methods could not be implemented. Social media platforms offer an alternative approach for recruiting diverse samples of participants for clinical trials, including those testing digital health interventions. This approach allowed for a quicker recruitment process without the physical constraints associated with traditional in-person methods. Objective: This study aimed to detail the online and social media campaigns used to recruit participants for “Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation” (DIAMANTE), a randomized controlled trial testing a smartphone-based intervention (a text messaging system that uses machine learning to personalize content) to increase physical activity for patients with diabetes and depression. In describing the recruitment process, we seek to offer insights to the research community on recruitment through online and social media advertisements for diverse communities. Methods: This study sought to recruit demographically diverse individuals in the United States through social media, including paid advertisements on Craigslist and Facebook (Meta). For the DIAMANTE project recruitment, we created 18 personas that mapped into the population’s target demographics using a user-centered design methodology. We deployed targeted English and Spanish ads on Craigslist and Facebook in 78 cities based on county-level demographics and diabetes prevalence data to target diverse individuals aged 18‐75 years old, who had been diagnosed with diabetes and had documented depressive symptoms. Results: A total of 1379 individuals completed the study’s initial screening survey. Of those, 71 respondents on Facebook and 508 on Craigslist were interested in enrolling in our study. In total, 26 out of 58 (45%) eligible respondents from Facebook and 50 out of 235 (21.3%) eligible respondents from Craigslist were eventually recruited in the randomized controlled trial. In all, both platforms showed poor performance in recruiting Spanish speakers, with Facebook advertisements accounting for 0 and Craigslist for 4 (5.3%) of such participants. When it came to English speakers, Craigslist proved to be the better performing platform compared to Facebook, both in terms of reach (579 vs 71) and cost-effectiveness (US $67.61 in average cost per recruited participant vs US $80.16). While Craigslist ads reached more people, resulting in more completed screening surveys than Facebook ads, there was a higher number of ineligible and incomplete enrollment from Craigslist compared with Facebook, leading to a relatively lower conversion rate (9.4% vs 36.6%). Importantly, participants recruited through Craigslist were more ethnically and racially diverse than those recruited from Facebook. Conclusions: Results from this study revealed that it is possible to recruit diverse sample sets using social media and online advertisements. However, despite targeted recruitment efforts, social media recruitment of Spanish speakers proved especially challenging and costly. Further research is needed to determine systematic, online methods for recruiting marginalized communities.",10.2196/56329,1,Scopus,105004335117,2-s2.0-105004335117,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004335117
Effects of home-use transcranial direct current stimulation on clusters of depressive symptoms: an ancillary analysis of the PSYLECT study,Luethi M.S.,2025,Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry,"Objective: Major depressive disorder is heterogeneous. While transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an effective treatment, its impact on symptoms remains underexplored. This ancillary study investigated the effects of home-use tDCS on depression symptom clusters. Methods: Data were used from the Portable Transcranial Electrical Stimulation and Internet-Based Behavioral Therapy for Major Depression Study (PSYLECT) study, in which 210 depressed patients were randomized to active (n=137) or sham tDCS (n=73) for 6 weeks. Items from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were grouped into symptom clusters using hierarchical clustering. Treatment effects were analyzed with mixed regressions. An alternative clustering solution was also evaluated using a larger sample. Results: Four clusters were identified: emotional, sleep, psychomotor, and psychosomatic symptoms. None showed significant group differences (sleep: p = 0.058, Cohen’s d = 0.36, emotional: p = 0.976, d =-0.01, psychosomatic: p = 0.157, d = 0.27, psychomotor: p = 0.944, d = 0.01). The alternative clustering solution produced a similar sleep cluster, where tDCS led to significant reductions (p = 0.033, d = 0.41), but no differences were observed in other clusters (emotional: p = 0.707, d = 0.07, atypical: p = 0.537, d = 0.12). Conclusion: The association between tDCS and sleep improvement warrants further study. tDCS may be more effective for specific symptom clusters.",10.47626/1516-4446-2024-3972,1,Scopus,105016815548,2-s2.0-105016815548,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016815548
Social Media and Youth Mental Health: Scoping Review of Platform and Policy Recommendations,Chhabra J.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: High rates of social media use and mental ill-health among young people have drawn significant public, policy, and research concern. Rapid technological advancements and changes in platform design have outpaced our understanding of the health effects of social media and hampered timely evidence-based regulatory responses. While a proliferation of recommendations to social media companies and governments has been published, a comprehensive summary of recommendations for protecting young people’s mental health and digital safety does not yet exist. Objective: This scoping review synthesized published recommendations for social media companies and governments in relation to young people’s (aged 12-25 years) mental health. A qualitative approach was used to undertake inductive content analysis, where recommendations were grouped under conceptually similar themes. Methods: We searched academic (PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO) and nonacademic (Overton and Google) databases for relevant documents. Eligible documents provided recommendations to regulators and social media companies that pertained to social media, young people, and mental health. This review excluded recommendations for young people, caregivers, educators, or clinicians surrounding strategies for managing individual social media use; instead, the recommendations emphasized the regulation or design of social media products and practices of social media companies. Peer-reviewed and gray literature from selected Western contexts (Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States) were relevant for inclusion. Documents were published between January 2020 and September 2024. Results: Of the identified 4980 unique reports, 120 (2.41%) progressed to full-text screening, and 70 (1.41%) met the inclusion criteria. Five interrelated themes were identified: (1) legislating and overseeing accountability, (2) transparency, (3) collaboration, (4) safety by design, and (5) restricting young people’s access to social media. Conclusions: This review emphasizes the need for multipronged approaches to address the rapidly increasing presence and reach of social media platforms in the lives of young people. These recommendations provide practical and tangible paths forward for governments and industry, backed by expert organizations in youth mental health and technology regulation at a time when expert-informed guidance is sorely needed. Rigorous evaluation of the proposed recommendations is needed while continuing to build on the emerging peer-reviewed evidence base that should form the foundation of policy and regulatory changes.",10.2196/72061,3,Scopus,105009297117,2-s2.0-105009297117,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009297117
Investigating Smartphone-Based Sensing Features for Depression Severity Prediction: Observation Study,Terhorst Y.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Unobtrusively collected objective sensor data from everyday devices like smartphones provide a novel paradigm to infer mental health symptoms. This process, called smart sensing, allows a fine-grained assessment of various features (eg, time spent at home based on the GPS sensor). Based on its prevalence and impact, depression is a promising target for smart sensing. However, currently, it is unclear which sensor-based features should be used in depression severity prediction and if they hold an incremental benefit over established fine-grained assessments like the ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate various features based on the smartphone screen, app usage, and call sensor alongside EMA to infer depression severity. Bivariate, cluster-wise, and cluster-combined analyses were conducted to determine the incremental benefit of smart sensing features compared to each other and EMA in parsimonious regression models for depression severity. Methods: In this exploratory observational study, participants were recruited from the general population. Participants needed to be 18 years of age, provide written informed consent, and own an Android-based smartphone. Sensor data and EMA were collected via the INSIGHTS app. Depression severity was assessed using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Missing data were handled by multiple imputations. Correlation analyses were conducted for bivariate associations; stepwise linear regression analyses were used to find the best prediction models for depression severity. Models were compared by adjusted R2. All analyses were pooled across the imputed datasets according to Rubin's rule. Results: A total of 107 participants were included in the study. Ages ranged from 18 to 56 (mean 22.81, SD 7.32) years, and 78% of the participants identified as female. Depression severity was subclinical on average (mean 5.82, SD 4.44; Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10: 18.7%). Small to medium correlations were found for depression severity and EMA (eg, valence: r=-0.55, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.41), and there were small correlations with sensing features (eg, screen duration: r=0.37, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.53). EMA features could explain 35.28% (95% CI 20.73% to 49.64%) of variance and sensing features (adjusted R2=20.45%, 95% CI 7.81% to 35.59%). The best regression model contained EMA and sensing features (R2=45.15%, 95% CI 30.39% to 58.53%). Conclusions: Our findings underline the potential of smart sensing and EMA to infer depression severity as isolated paradigms and when combined. Although these could become important parts of clinical decision support systems for depression diagnostics and treatment in the future, confirmatory studies are needed before they can be applied to routine care. Furthermore, privacy, ethical, and acceptance issues need to be addressed.",10.2196/55308,2,Scopus,85216815079,2-s2.0-85216815079,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216815079
Effectiveness of Neurofeedback-Assisted and Conventional 6-Week Web-Based Mindfulness Interventions on Mental Health of Chinese Nursing Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,Jing S.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Nursing students experience disproportionately high rates of mental health challenges, underscoring the urgent need for innovative, scalable interventions. Web-based mindfulness programs, and more recently, neurofeedback-enhanced approaches, present potentially promising avenues for addressing this critical issue. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of the neurofeedback-assisted online mindfulness intervention (NAOM) and the conventional online mindfulness intervention (COM) in reducing mental health symptoms among Chinese nursing students. Methods: A 3-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted among 147 nursing students in Beijing, China, using a 6-week web-based mindfulness program. Participants received NAOM, COM, or general mental health education across 6 weeks. Electroencephalogram and validated tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire were used to primarily assess symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at 1 and 3 months after the intervention. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the effects of intervention and time. Results: A total of 155 participants enrolled in the study, and 147 finished all assessments. Significant reductions in the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were observed in the NAOM (mean difference [MD]=−3.330, Cohen d=0.926, P<.001; MD=−3.468, Cohen d=1.091, P<.001; MD=−2.620, Cohen d=0.743, P<.001, respectively) and the COM (MD=−1.875, Cohen d=0.490, P=.03; MD=−1.750, Cohen d=0.486, P=.02; MD=−2.229, Cohen d=0.629, P=.01, respectively) groups compared with the control group at postintervention assessment. Moreover, the NAOM group showed significantly better effects than the COM group in alleviating depressive symptoms (MD=−1.455; Cohen d=0.492; P=.04) and anxiety symptoms (MD=−1.718; Cohen d=0.670; P=.04) and improving the level of mindfulness (MD=−3.765; Cohen d=1.245; P<.001) at the postintervention assessment. However, no significant difference except for the anxiety symptoms was observed across the 3 groups at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Conclusions: This 6-week web-based mindfulness intervention, both conventional and neurofeedback-assisted, effectively alleviated mental health problems in the short term among nursing students. The addition of neurofeedback demonstrated greater short-term benefits; however, but these effects were not sustained over the long term. Future research should focus on long-term interventions using a more robust methodological approach.",10.2196/71741,1,Scopus,105006749510,2-s2.0-105006749510,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006749510
AR Dancee: An Augmented Reality-Based Mobile Persuasive Intervention for Promoting Physical Activity Through Dancing,Odenigbo I.P.,2025,International Journal of Human Computer Interaction,"The importance of physical activity (PA) for overall health and well-being cannot be overstated, especially in today’s fast-paced and sedentary society. Engaging in enjoyable activities like dancing can significantly enhance PA levels and positively affect one’s mood. Advances in technology have the potential to increase individuals’ engagement in more physical activities. This work explores the effectiveness of augmented reality-driven persuasive intervention in enhancing users’ physical activity and mood. To achieve our goal, we developed AR Dancee, a mobile-driven intervention combining Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, and persuasive technology to encourage adults to increase their PA through dancing, ultimately improving their mood. A 15-day user study with 104 participants showed that the intervention effectively increased PA levels, with equal effectiveness across genders and a stronger impact on younger adults. The results also show that the intervention improved participants’ mood while reducing anxiety levels, demonstrating its potential for stress management. Overall, the contribution of this work to the HCI fields is threefold: (1) the design and development of an AR-driven persuasive mobile app, (2) providing design recommendations, and (3) pinpointing limitations and providing suggestions for future work.",10.1080/10447318.2024.2384136,3,Scopus,85200213914,2-s2.0-85200213914,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200213914
How digital therapeutic alliances influence the perceived helpfulness of online mental health Q&A: An explainable machine learning approach,Huang Y.,2025,Digital Health,"Objective: This study investigates the role of digital therapeutic alliance (DTA) in predicting and explaining the perceived helpfulness of responses on online mental health Q&A platforms. Methods: This study constructs a large dataset of 19,682 Q&A interactions from online mental health Q&A platforms, employs natural language processing, explainable machine learning, and causal inference methods to identify and understand the factors, particularly DTA, that influence the perceived helpfulness of human counselors’ responses to mental health questions. Results: The machine learning-based model for predicting perceived helpfulness demonstrated strong performance, achieving an root mean square error of 0.8234 and a mean absolute percentage error of 22.7288%. The explanatory analysis revealed that peripheral path-related language cues, such as counselor engagement (e.g., word count and response time), had the highest predictive power. Additionally, central path-related language cues, such as those linked to the DTA—specifically emotional bonds and therapeutic tasks—significantly influenced perceived helpfulness and were positively impacted by counselor engagement. Conclusion: This study integrates DTA and elaboration likelihood model theories to propose a computational framework for understanding and predicting the perceived helpfulness of responses in online mental health Q&A platforms. Findings offer theoretical insights into the mechanisms of perceived helpfulness and practical guidance for optimizing platform design, training counselors, and improving user satisfaction through targeted language strategies.",10.1177/20552076251333480,0,Scopus,105004460859,2-s2.0-105004460859,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004460859
A Cross-Sectional Online Study of the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Nursing Research as Perceived by Nursing Students,Algunmeeyn A.,2025,Sage Open Nursing,"Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare in general and scientific research in particular has become increasingly prevalent as it holds great promise for optimizing research processes and outcomes. Aims: This study described predictors and differences in students’ perceptions of the risks and benefits related to using AI in nursing research. Methods: A quantitative transverse study was implemented utilizing a convenient sample of 434 nursing students from a governmental university. Data were analyzed using many descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Nursing students perceived AI in nursing research positively, with an overall mean score of 3.24/5 (SE =.024). Their feelings about AI were generally positive (Mean = 3.54/5; SE =.049; 95% CI = 3.45–3.64). Perceived risks of using AI in research were high (Mean = 1.59/2, SE =.016), especially concerning liability issues (Mean = 3.50/5, SE =.031), communication barriers (Mean = 3.48, SE =.035), unregulated standards (Mean = 3.37, SE =.034), privacy concerns (Mean = 3.37, SE =.034), social biases (Mean = 3.33, SE =.033), performance anxiety (Mean = 3.31, SE =.034), and mistrust in AI mechanisms (Mean = 3.28, SE =.032). The perceived benefits were also high (Mean = 3.46, SE =.030), with a strong intention to use AI-based tools (Mean = 3.52, SE =.033). Key predictors were high GPA and training in public hospitals. hospitals. Conclusion: AI in nursing research has many benefits; however, it comes with risks that need immediate management. Nursing students’ GPAs and the hospitals where they received their training were often the key factors that shaped how well they understood the use of AI in nursing research. High-achieving students who were trained in public and teaching hospitals tend to be better users of AI in nursing research.",10.1177/23779608251330866,1,Scopus,105002604984,2-s2.0-105002604984,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002604984
The Stress Burden and Positive Coping Among the United Arab Emirates Population During Crisis: A Cross-sectional Study from the Pandemic Era,Aljawarneh Y.M.,2025,Dubai Medical Journal,"Introduction: The pandemic crisis created a psychosocial and public health crisis that affected the lives of millions globally. This cross-sectional study aims to examine the stress burden during the pandemic crisis and positive coping among the general population in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional design to examine the stress burden of the pandemic crisis and positive coping among the general population in the UAE. The study questionnaires were sent to potential participants as an online survey. A total of 465 UAE residents were enrolled between October and December 2021. The stress burden and positive coping were measured using the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ). Results: Regarding stress burdens related to the pandemic crisis, only 20.9% (n = 97) of the participants reported no stress burden, while most of the participants had mild to moderate stress burden (124 (26.7%) and 188 (40.4%), respectively). In contrast, 56 participants (12.0%) had severe stress burden related to the pandemic crisis. Positive coping with daytime structure was reported as 102 participants (21.9%) reported highly effective coping, 123 participants (26.5%) reported moderately effective coping, 137 participants (29.5%) reported slightly effective coping, and 103 participants (22.2%) reported ineffective coping. Positive coping with inner resources was reported where most of the participants reported either highly or moderately effective coping (110 (23.7%) and 155 (33.3%), respectively), while only 62 participants (13.3%) reported ineffective coping. Being symptomatic quarantined was significantly associated with positive coping categories of daytime structure but not inner resources, while being infected was significantly associated with both positive coping categories of daytime structure and inner resources. Stress burden was significantly associated with demographic variables (marital status, gender, and age) pandemic-specific variables (quarantined, infected, and symptomatic), and psychological variables (pre-existing conditions and undergoing psychotherapy). Conclusion: The pandemic crisis has significantly affected the stress burden of the UAE population. The individual differences identified in this study underscore the importance of anticipating the impact of future crises and implementing personalized interventions that address the needs of vulnerable groups.",10.18502/dmj.v8i1.18309,0,Scopus,105004684546,2-s2.0-105004684546,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004684546
Economic and clinical outcomes of cesarean deliveries with skin closure using 2-octyl cyanoacrylate plus polymer mesh tape versus conventional smooth sutures plus waterproof wound dressings,Johnston S.S.,2025,Journal of Maternal Fetal and Neonatal Medicine,"Objective: Cesarean delivery is the most common major operating room procedure performed in the United States. Wound closure after cesarean delivery includes suturing for uterine closure and to close the fascial—and sometimes subcutaneous—tissue layer followed by skin closure. Optimal skin closure is critical as it affects the risk of both cesarean wound infection and dehiscence. To our knowledge, however, no clinical or real-world studies comparing 2OPMT with conventional sutures for skin closure following cesarean delivery have been published to date. We sought to compare the economic and clinical outcomes of cesarean deliveries with skin closure using 2-octyl cyanoacrylate plus polymer mesh tape (2OPMT) versus conventional smooth sutures plus waterproof wound dressings (CS-WWD). Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study using a database derived from hospital electronic health records and billing data from over 1,000 U.S. hospitals (PINC AI<sup>™</sup> Healthcare Database). Eligible patients were aged 18–49 who underwent cesarean delivery between 1 October 2015 and 30 June 2022. From records of medical supplies used during deliveries, we identified deliveries for which skin closure was performed using either 2OPMT or CS-WWD. Outcomes included: post-surgical length of stay (LOS), total hospital costs for the cesarean delivery stay, 30-day readmissions of various acuity to the same hospital in which the cesarean delivery occurred, and two 30-day clinical/wound complication outcomes (occurrence during the initial cesarean delivery stay or within 30 days thereafter), which included: (a) a composite endpoint of cesarean wound surgical site infection and/or dehiscence; and (b) a composite endpoint of cesarean wound surgical site infection and/or dehiscence, puerperal infection, endometritis, urinary tract infection, hematoma of the skin, cellulitis, and/or other unspecified skin infection. We compared outcomes between the groups after stable balance weighting the CS-WWD group to mimic the 2OPMT group on numerous patient, provider, and hospital characteristics. Results: After weighting, the CSWWD (N = 13,551) and 2OPMT (N = 16,068) groups were well-balanced on all characteristics (standardized mean differences for balancing covariates <|0.10|). Compared with the CS-WWD group, the 2OPMT group had statistically significant shorter mean post-surgical LOS (1.56 days for 2OPMT vs. 1.73 days for CS-WWD, p < 0.001), lower mean hospital costs for the cesarean delivery stay ($9,499 vs. $10,362, p < 0.001), lower incidence proportions of 30-day inpatient readmission (1.43% vs. 1.83%, p = 0.009), 30-day emergency room visits (5.22% vs. 6.18%, p < 0.001), 30-day composite of inpatient readmission/emergency room visits (6.47% vs. 7.70%, p < 0.001), 30-day visits of other kinds, such as outpatient (5.32% vs. 9.50%, p < 0.001), 30-day overall readmission/visits comprising all categories above (11.00% vs. 15.90%, p < 0.001), and lower 30-day incidence proportion of cesarean wound surgical site infection and/or dehiscence (1.13% vs. 1.72%, p < 0.001) and cesarean wound surgical site infection and/or dehiscence, puerperal infection, endometritis, urinary tract infection, hematoma of the skin, cellulitis, and/or other unspecified skin infection (2.17% vs. 3.23%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: In this large observational study, cesarean deliveries with skin closure using 2OPMT were associated with lower post-surgical length of stay, lower total hospital costs for the cesarean delivery stay, lower incidence proportions of 30-day readmissions, and lower incidence proportions of 30-day clinical/wound complications as compared with CS-WWD.",10.1080/14767058.2025.2463390,0,Scopus,85219323301,2-s2.0-85219323301,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219323301
Passive Sensing for Mental Health Monitoring Using Machine Learning With Wearables and Smartphones: Scoping Review,Shen S.Y.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Mental health issues have become a significant global public health challenge. Traditional assessments rely on subjective methods with limited ecological validity. Passive sensing via wearable devices and smartphones, combined with machine learning (ML), enables objective, continuous, and noninvasive mental health monitoring. Objective: This study aimed to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of passive sensing–based and ML technologies for mental health monitoring. We summarized the technical approaches, revealed the association patterns between behavioral features and mental disorders, and explored potential directions for future advancements. Methods: This scoping review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and was prospectively registered on the Open Science Framework. We systematically searched 7 databases (Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library) for studies published between January 2015 and February 2025. We included 42 peer-reviewed studies that used passive sensing from wearables or smartphones with ML to monitor clinically diagnosed mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Data were synthesized across technical dimensions (data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and ML models) and clinical associations, with behavioral features categorized into 8 domains. Results: The 42 included studies were predominantly cohort designs (23/42, 55%), with a median sample size of 60.5 (IQR 54-99). Most studies focused on depression (23/42, 55%) and anxiety (9/42, 21%) using primarily wrist-worn devices (32/42, 76%) collecting heart rate (28/42, 67%), movement index (25/42, 60%), and step count (17/42, 40%) as key biomarkers. Deep learning models (eg, convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory) showed high accuracy, while traditional ML (eg, random forest) remained prevalent due to better interpretability. We identified critical limitations, including small samples (32/42, 76% with N<100), short monitoring periods (19/42, 45% <7 days), scarce external validation (1/42, 2%), and limited reporting on data anonymization (6/42, 14%). Conclusions: While passive sensing and ML demonstrate promising accuracy (eg, convolutional neural network–long short-term memory achieving 92.16% in anxiety detection), the evidence remains constrained by three key limitations: (1) methodological heterogeneity (32/42, 76% single-device studies; 19/42, 45% with <7-day monitoring), (2) high risk of bias from small samples (median 60.5, IQR 54-99 participants) and scarce external validation (1/42, 2%), and (3) ethical gaps (only 6/42, 14% addressing anonymization). These findings underscore the technology’s potential to transform mental health care through objective, continuous monitoring—particularly for depression (heart rate and step count biomarkers) and anxiety (sleep and social interaction patterns). However, clinical translation requires standardized protocols, larger longitudinal studies (≥3 months), and ethical frameworks for data privacy. Future work should prioritize multimodal sensor fusion and explainable artificial intelligence to bridge the gap between technical performance and clinical deployability.",10.2196/77066,1,Scopus,105013096860,2-s2.0-105013096860,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013096860
"Typology and Ethical Considerations of Digital Health Promotion Tools for Youth in Sub-Saharan Africa: Review of Examples From Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa",Ferretti A.,2025,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Digital technologies for health promotion have proliferated over the past decade, with uptake increasing steadily among young people, including those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Youth increasingly rely on digital tools for health information, and the early influence of this digital technology can have an impact throughout the lifespan. While there is a growing body of literature on the opportunities and challenges of digital health promotion (DHP) for young people, a gap remains in research that closely examines the characteristics of digital health strategies developed specifically for youth in LMICs. Objective: In this paper, we investigate and compare selected examples of DHP tools from 3 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, namely Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. Our aim is to create a multidimensional descriptive typology of DHP tools developed specifically to promote the health of adolescents and young adults in these countries. Methods: To select the tools, we conducted systematic internet-based searches using relevant keywords, incorporating the expertise of local professionals to ensure a thorough search. Included solutions originated from one of the 3 countries of focus and could take any number of forms such as apps, websites, chatbots, or social media initiatives. We thereafter deductively created a typology describing selected features of each tool, including the health area of focus, key stakeholders, type of service, and ethical values explicitly referenced within the tool. While such high-level features of interest were selected based on the existing literature in the field, the detailed descriptive categories were identified through an inductive analysis of the tools. Results: A total of 31 DHP tools were identified. Sexual and reproductive health was the most common health area of focus for DHP services, which were primarily funded and supported by local non-governmental organizations, foundations, and international organizations. The assessed tools were predominantly web-based and social media-based, with the overarching goal and core value of expanding health knowledge and offering access to health promotion services to young people. Conclusions: With sustained investment, DHP can improve the health of young people while relieving pressure on health care services. The areas of mental health, as well as substance use prevention and nutrition, stand out with clear potential for health gains through investment in DHP. Addressing ethical concerns such as privacy, transparency, equity, and inclusiveness is essential to the safety, usefulness, and fairness of DHP. To achieve the greatest benefit, local youth perspectives and priorities should be included in DHP development. Local initiatives have the potential to be the most agile, flexible, and relevant for the target audience of young people, with the overall goal of early intervention and greater health quality throughout the lifespan, and more efficient use of health care resources.",10.2196/54472,0,Scopus,105016416420,2-s2.0-105016416420,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016416420
Burden and trends of major depressive disorders among women of childbearing age and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from the global burden of disease study 2021,Liao G.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibits a pronounced female predominance, contributing substantially to disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) among women of childbearing age (WCBA; 15–49 years). The COVID-19 pandemic intensified this burden via psychosocial stressors and disrupted healthcare access, yet integrated analyses of pre- and post-pandemic trends are scarce. Methods: Leveraging GBD 2021 data, we assessed MDD prevalence, incidence, and DALYs among WCBA globally, regionally, and nationally (1990–2021). Burden estimates were reported as point values with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Temporal trends were quantified via estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and absolute percentage change (PC). We employed autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to compare pre-pandemic (1990–2019) and pandemic-inclusive (1990–2021) projections through 2036. Results: Global prevalent cases among WCBA surged from 49.6 million (95% UI: 41.6 to 60.2) in 1990 to 85.6 million (95% UI: 70.3 to 103.8) in 2021, reflecting a 25.7% acceleration during 2019–2021 versus 1.2% annual growth pre-pandemic. Prevalence rates declined marginally pre-2019 (EAPC: −0.38, 95% CI: −0.48 to −0.29) but reversed sharply post-pandemic (EAPC: 11.47, 95% CI: −0.56 to 24.95), reaching 4,394.55 per 100,000 population in 2021. Regionally, middle and low-middle socio-demographic index (SDI) regions accounted for over 55% of global cases (23 million [95% UI: 18.9 to 27.8] and 24.2 million [95% UI: 19.6 to 29.9], respectively) in 2021, while low SDI regions showed the fastest growth (160% since 1990). High-SDI regions exhibited extremes: the highest 2021 prevalence rate (5915.76 per 100,000 population) and steepest post-2019 surge (EAPC: 13.66). In 2021, the prevalence rates were highest in high-income North America (8403.17 per 100,000 population) and lowest in East Asia (1856.99 per 100,000 population). Nationally, India reported the highest prevalent cases (16.3 million, 19% of global share), while Greenland had the highest prevalence rate (13,822.85 per 100,000 population). Adolescents (15–19 years) experienced the largest pandemic-driven increase (30.06% PC), except in East Asia where prevalence rates declined (−11.53%). ARIMA projections suggest 103.06 million global prevalent cases by 2036—32% above pre-pandemic estimates—with high SDI regions persisting at 5,617.68 per 100,000 population. Conclusions: Our analysis reveals a dual crisis: high SDI regions face entrenched high prevalence rates (5,617.68 per 100,000 population projected), while low SDI regions carry substantial burden (4,593.77 per 100,000) with rapid case expansion (160% since 1990). The pandemic disproportionately impacted adolescents globally (+30.06% PC), yet East Asia demonstrated resilience (−11.53% PC). These findings demand stratified interventions: digital mental health tools in high-income settings, community-based screening in resource-limited areas, and adolescent-focused programs worldwide. Immediate policy action is needed to avert intergenerational mental health consequences.",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630601,0,Scopus,105017902768,2-s2.0-105017902768,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017902768
Implementing a collaborative care model for child and adolescent mental health in Qatar: Addressing workforce and access challenges,Khoodoruth M.A.S.,2025,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Child and adolescent mental health disorders in Qatar remain significantly underserved due to a critical shortage of specialists, stigma, and logistical barriers.

Two-way perspective on problematic internet use in adolescent psychiatric patients: predictive and associated factors: Problematic Internet Use in Adolescents,Gul M.K.,2025,Nordic Journal of Psychiatry,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between problematic Internet use (PIU) and suicide probability, aggression, and impulsivity in an adolescent clinical sample. Methods: Four hundred and eighty-four adolescents who applied to the child psychiatry outpatient clinic of a university hospital were included in the study. They filled out a sociodemographic data form, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Suicide Probability Scale (SPS), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11-Short Form (BIS-11-SF), and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ). Results: The time spent on the Internet, BIS-11-SF/MI, BIS-11-SF/AI, SPS subscales, and BPAQ scores of adolescents with PIU were significantly higher compared to those of normal Internet users. Having a computer at home, having a smartphone, time spent on the Internet, older age, SPS/hopelessness, and BPAQ scores were found to be predictive factors of PIU, but psychiatric diagnoses had no predictive effect (p > 0.05). SPS/hopelessness and BPAQ scores were statistically significant in distinguishing adolescents with PIU from those without. BIS-11-SF, SPS/hopelessness scores, and time spent on the Internet were the most important factors in predicting IAT total scores. Conclusions: Determining the relationship between PIU, aggression, suicidal behavior, and impulsivity in adolescents will be effective in protecting them from potential harm.",10.1080/08039488.2025.2508947,0,Scopus,105005844587,2-s2.0-105005844587,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005844587
AI Applications in Depression Detection and Diagnosis: Bibliometric and Visual Analysis of Trends and Future Directions,Ren W.,2025,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Depression is a highly prevalent and debilitating mental disorder, but its diagnosis largely relies on subjective assessments, creating challenges in accuracy and consistency. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising avenues for more objective and efficient diagnostic approaches. Understanding the evolving landscape of AI applications in depression diagnosis is essential for guiding future research and clinical translation. Objective: This study aims to provide a comprehensive bibliometric and visual analysis of the global research trends, intellectual structure, and emerging frontiers in the application of AI for depression detection and diagnosis from 2015 to 2024. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify publications on AI applications in depression diagnosis from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024. A total of 2304 articles were retrieved and analyzed using bibliometric software CiteSpace. The analysis encompassed temporal trends, keyword dynamics, author collaboration networks, institutional influence, country contributions, and intellectual foundations through co-citation analysis of journals and references. Results: The field exhibited exponential growth in publications and citations, particularly after 2018, reflecting increasing academic and clinical interest. Key thematic shifts were observed from traditional machine learning to advanced deep learning, multimodal fusion, and the integration of objective biomarkers (eg, electroencephalography, facial expressions). Leading contributors included institutions from China and the United States, with collaborative links also forming with countries such as Canada and Singapore. The intellectual base is highly interdisciplinary, drawing heavily from computer science, neuroscience, and psychiatry, with a notable surge in engineering and translational research. Conclusions: The integration of AI in depression diagnosis is a rapidly maturing and diversifying field, transitioning from theoretical exploration to clinically relevant applications that emphasize objective, data-driven approaches. The identified trends underscore the need for enhanced interdisciplinary and international collaboration, the development of ethical frameworks, and a focus on translating technological innovations into accessible and equitable mental health solutions. These findings offer valuable insights for researchers, clinicians, and policy makers to strategically advance AI-assisted depression diagnostics globally.",10.2196/79293,0,Scopus,105019205756,2-s2.0-105019205756,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019205756
Predicting Satisfaction With Chat-Counseling at a 24/7 Chat Hotline for the Youth: Natural Language Processing Study,Hornstein S.,2025,Jmir AI,"Background: Chat-based counseling services are popular for the low-threshold provision of mental health support to youth. In addition, they are particularly suitable for the utilization of natural language processing (NLP) for improved provision of care. Objective: Consequently, this paper evaluates the feasibility of such a use case, namely, the NLP-based automated evaluation of satisfaction with the chat interaction. This preregistered approach could be used for evaluation and quality control procedures, as it is particularly relevant for those services. Methods: The consultations of 2609 young chatters (around 140,000 messages) and corresponding feedback were used to train and evaluate classifiers to predict whether a chat was perceived as helpful or not. On the one hand, we trained a word vectorizer in combination with an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier, applying cross-validation and extensive hyperparameter tuning. On the other hand, we trained several transformer-based models, comparing model types, preprocessing, and over-and undersampling techniques. For both model types, we selected the best-performing approach on the training set for a final performance evaluation on the 522 users in the final test set. Results: The fine-tuned XGBoost classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.69 (P<.001), as well as a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.25 on the previously unseen test set. The selected Longformer-based model did not outperform this baseline, scoring 0.68 (P=.69). A Shapley additive explanations explainability approach suggested that help seekers rating a consultation as helpful commonly expressed their satisfaction already within the conversation. In contrast, the rejection of offered exercises predicted perceived unhelpfulness. Conclusions: Chat conversations include relevant information regarding the perceived quality of an interaction that can be used by NLP-based prediction approaches. However, to determine if the moderate predictive performance translates into meaningful service improvements requires randomized trials. Further, our results highlight the relevance of contrasting pretrained models with simpler baselines to avoid the implementation of unnecessarily complex models.

Local adaptation and validation of a transdiagnostic risk calculator for first episode psychosis using mental health patient records,Ford E.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Few at-risk adults are identified by specialized services prior to the development of a first episode of psychosis. A transdiagnostic risk calculator, predicting psychosis using electronic health record (EHR) data, was developed in London, UK to identify patients at risk, using structured data and 14 natural language processing (NLP)-derived symptom and substance use concepts. We report the adaptation and internal validation of this risk calculator in a Southeast England region. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study using EHR patient notes we identified individuals accessing mental healthcare in Southeast England (Nov-1992 to Jan-2023) who received a primary diagnosis of a non-psychotic or non-organic mental disorder. We developed new machine-learning NLP algorithms for diagnosis, symptom and substance use concepts by fine-tuning existing open-source transformer models. Baseline and outcome coded diagnoses were supplemented with NLP-derived diagnosis data. Cox regression was used to predict psychosis and prior weights were applied; discrimination (Harrell’s C) was assessed. Results: Nearly all NLP concepts achieved an F1-measure of accuracy above 0.8 following development. In an analysis sample of 63,922 patients with complete data, the risk calculator had acceptable but lower accuracy in Southeast England (Harrell’s C 0.71) compared to the London benchmark (Harrell’s C 0.85). Conclusions: The risk calculator performed similarly in Southeast England to other external validation studies, discriminating acceptably, suggesting that this calculator may be adapted successfully for new patient populations, services and geographic areas. Differences in accuracy may be due to different cultures of data capture, different NLP approaches, or differences in the patient cohort.",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1584719,0,Scopus,105012582190,2-s2.0-105012582190,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012582190
Evaluating the Feasibility and Acceptability of a Mobile Mental Health Intervention for Adolescent Depression and Anxiety,Davis A.,2025,Clinical Pediatrics,"The adolescent mental health crisis is compounded by a shortage of mental health services, which mobile health apps may alleviate. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the Wysa app (a commercially available app containing cognitive behavioral therapy-based digital modules and an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent) among 13- to 18-year-old adolescents recruited from a primary care clinic in New York City and online from March to June 2022. We assessed adolescent engagement in the Wysa app over a 3-week period. Out of 44 participants, app uptake was 77.3% (34/44). Among those who used the app, participants used the app a median of 9 times (IQR: 5–19). Over 3-quarters (n = 25) of participants who used the app would recommend the app to others, and 60.6% rated the app 4–5 stars (5 stars maximum rating).

Recommendations for the development of digital conversational agents for youth with mental health conditions: A position paper,Hawke L.D.,2025,Digital Health,"Digital conversational agents (“chatbots”) hold interesting potential as a technology that can be used to deliver mental health interventions and supports to people in need. Youth are high users of digital technology and are widely affected by mental health conditions; youth might therefore be particularly interested in using digital conversational agents to support their mental health. We reviewed the literature on digital conversational agents for mental health, then conducted a two-pronged qualitative study of these tools for youth with mental health conditions. While the evidence base is limited, there is some preliminary evidence of utility and acceptability to users of this technology. In our qualitative study, youth were cautiously optimistic about using a digital conversational agent for mental health and identified potential benefits, but also substantial concerns. In terms of content and format, they wanted reliable, accurate, validated information, a flexible format, and a friendly interaction style, with attention to confidentiality and security. From these findings, we propose eight distinct recommendations to guide the rigorous development of digital conversational agents for youth mental health. By following these recommendations, it may be possible to build tools that leverage the strengths and potential of modern conversational agents while mitigating the potential harms to youth.",10.1177/20552076251393355,0,Scopus,105020399746,2-s2.0-105020399746,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020399746
Technology-Based Interventions for Promoting Well-Being in Childhood and Adolescence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Rodríguez-Rivas M.E.,2025,Psicothema,"Background: Well-being is crucial for children’s and adolescents’ mental health. Despite numerous interventions, innovative technological options are still underexplored, particularly for younger populations. This study aims to review, summarize, and discuss experimental studies on the effects of technological interventions on well-being in childhood and adolescence. Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, including studies published since 2013. Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science including randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. The quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB-2) and ROBINS-I tools. Meta-analyses were performed using R studio. Results: Of the 2705 articles screened by title and abstract, 55 underwent full-text review. Seventeen articles were included, showing a diversity of technology-based interventions, including apps, web-based intervention, digital intervention, and chatbots. The meta-analysis (n = 5636 participants) showed a small but statistically significant effect in promoting well-being (Hedges’s g = 0.18; p <.01). App-based interventions demonstrated a notably larger effect size (Hedges’s g = 0.33; p <.001).

Conversational Agent-Based Mental Health Support for Students: Identifying Psychosocial Resources and Stressors with WUM,Striegl J.,2025,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"In a society that has a high prevalence of mental health disorders, especially among adolescents and students, and a shortage of mental health professionals, it is indispensable to find solutions to make methods supporting mental well-being and resilience available in a scalable, low-threshold manner. While the use of cognitive behavioral therapy-based approaches using Conversational Agents (CAs) has seen a growing research interest, the delivery of other therapy approaches such as resource-oriented psychotherapy through CAs has not been covered sufficiently yet. This paper expands a novel concept of CA-based mental health support for students through identification of psychosocial resources and stressors and investigates its acceptance, usability, adherence, and perceived impact on mental well-being and resilience in a single-arm user study with healthy participants (N = 14). Specifically, it is investigated which factors influence frequency of use and perceived impact of the proposed system. Quantitative and qualitative questionnaires are administered pre-, and post-usage over a two week study period. Study outcomes indicate a high usability, while adherence and acceptance show moderate results. While minor changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety can be seen in the pre-post condition, measured symptoms, mental well-being, and resilience show no statistically significant differences before and after two weeks of system usage. Results indicate an effect of language proficiency and general technological affinity on frequency of use and perceived impact on mental health.Qualitative results indicate possible system extensions that could increase acceptance, adherence, and perceived impact in future system iterations.",10.1007/978-3-031-93505-3_17,0,Scopus,105007811376,2-s2.0-105007811376,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007811376
AI-Driven Mobile Usage Tracking and Management System for Youth,Rameshbhai P.K.,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 12th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development Indiacom 2025,"The concerns about the effects of excessive use on mental health, productivity and well-being emerged in response to the growing dependence of young people on mobile devices. Intelligent options are the furniture surveillance and management systems that use the artificial intelligence (AI). These systems use automatic learning and behavioral analysis to obtain the time when people transmit on the screens, how frequency uses general applications and habits. To promote responsible use of smartphones, these systems provide real information, personalized suggestions and adaptive interventions. The use notifications, controls and analysis of parents who may predict, if a person is too used are important aspects.

How artificial intelligence may affect our mental wellbeing,Bond R.R.,2025,Behaviour and Information Technology,"This editorial introduces a special issue in digital mental health and wellbeing and includes topics such as digital wellbeing, chatbots, virtual reality and youth mental health. This editorial also discusses the potential adverse psychological effects of an artificial intelligence (AI) centric future. We emphasise the need to be ‘wellbeing centric’ and not technology centric. AI can expedite tasks and ‘think’ on our behalf, but if the goal of humanity is to promote ‘wellbeing’ then ‘wellbeing’ should be a core design principle and an evaluation metric to assess AI technologies. We discuss how the potential adverse effects of social media can be a good case study for how we should assess the AI future–especially in the era of generative AI and AI companions. To illustrate a point, we explore a fictional scenario (akin to Laplace’s demon) that includes an AI agent that makes minute-by-minute ‘life recommendations’. We explore how such an AI could negatively affect our mental wellbeing, agency, autonomy and sense of free will–even if the ‘AI always knows best’.

Personalization variables in digital mental health interventions for depression and anxiety in adolescents and youth: a scoping review,Wanniarachchi V.U.,2025,Frontiers in Digital Health,"Introduction: The impact of personalization on user engagement and adherence in digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) has been widely explored. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding the prevalence of its application, as well as the dimensions and mechanisms of personalization within DMHIs for adolescents and youth. Methods: To understand how personalization has been applied in DMHIs for adolescents and young people, a scoping review was conducted. Empirical studies on DMHIs for adolescents and youth with depression and anxiety, published between 2013 and July 2024, were extracted from PubMed and Scopus. A total of 67 studies were included in the review. Additionally, we expanded an existing personalization framework, which originally classified personalization into four dimensions (content, order, guidance, and communication) and four mechanisms (user choice, provider choice, rule-based, and machine learning), by incorporating non-therapeutic elements. Results: The adapted framework includes therapeutic and non-therapeutic content, order, guidance, therapeutic and non-therapeutic communication, interfaces (customization of non-therapeutic visual or interactive components), and interactivity (personalization of user preferences), while retaining the original mechanisms. Half of the interventions studied used only one personalization dimension (51%), and more than two-thirds used only one personalization mechanism. This review found that personalization of therapeutic content (51% of the interventions) and interfaces (25%) were favored. User choice was the most prevalent personalization mechanism, present in 60% of interventions. Additionally, machine learning mechanisms were employed in a substantial number of cases (30%), but there were no instances of generative artificial intelligence (AI) among the included studies. Discussion: The findings of the review suggest that although personalization elements of the interventions are reported in the articles, their impact on younger people's experience with DMHIs and adherence to mental health protocols is not thoroughly addressed. Future interventions may benefit from incorporating generative AI, while adhering to standard clinical research practices, to further personalize user experiences.",10.3389/fdgth.2025.1500220,4,Scopus,105007154711,2-s2.0-105007154711,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105007154711
Perception of AI Use in Youth Mental Health Services: Qualitative Study,Ding X.,2025,Journal of Participatory Medicine,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made significant advancements in health care. A key application of using artificial intelligence for health (AIH) is the use of AI-powered chatbots; however, empirical evidence on their effectiveness and feasibility remains limited. Objective: This study explored interest group perceptions of integrating AIH in youth mental health services, focusing on its potential benefits, challenges, usefulness, and regulatory implications. Methods: This qualitative study used semistructured in-depth interviews with 23 mobile health stakeholders, including youth users, service providers, and nonclinical staff from an integrated youths’ service network. We used an inductive approach and thematic analysis to identify and summarize common themes and subthemes. Results: Participants identified AIH’s potential to support education, navigation, and administrative tasks in health care, as well as to create safe spaces and mitigate health resource burdens. However, they expressed concerns about the lack of human elements, such as empathy and clinical judgment. Key challenges included privacy issues, unknown risks from rapid technological advancements, and insufficient crisis management for sensitive mental health cases. Participants viewed AIH’s ability to mimic human behavior as a critical quality standard and emphasized the need for a robust evaluation framework combining objective metrics with subjective insights. Conclusions: While AIH has the potential to improve health care access and experience, it cannot address all mental health challenges and may exacerbate existing issues. While AIH could complement less-complex services, it could not replace the therapeutic value of human interaction at this time. Co-design with end users is critical for successful AI integration. Robust evaluation frameworks and an iterative approach to build a learning health system are essential to refine AIH and ensure it aligns with real-world evolving needs.",10.2196/69449,0,Scopus,105013985509,2-s2.0-105013985509,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013985509
Early Warning of Adolescent Depression: A Joint Detection Model Combining Social Media Speech Behaviour and Psychological Scales,Wang N.,2025,Journal of Mind and Behavior,"Adolescent depression represents a mounting public health challenge, with the widespread use of social media presenting novel opportunities for the early identification of depressive symptoms through language-based analysis. This research proposes and assesses an integrated detection model designed to recognise depressive tendencies among adolescents by examining their linguistic behaviour on social media, using annotated tweet data sourced from real-world contexts. Utilising a quantitative methodology based on secondary data, three machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and DistilBERT—were trained and evaluated on a dataset comprising 10,310 tweets. Among the models, DistilBERT demonstrated superior predictive capability, achieving an F1-score of 0.9981, an accuracy rate of 99.81%, and an AUC value of 0.9975, thereby surpassing the performance of the conventional classifiers. The results affirm that patterns in adolescent language use on social media platforms exhibit detectable signs of depression, which can be effectively identified using transformer-based architectures. The study advocates for the extension of this methodological framework to encompass multilingual and temporally varied datasets to enhance its applicability across broader populations. Practical applications include the early deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled systems within educational settings and digital environments for non-intrusive mental health surveillance. One principal limitation is the absence of real-time and multi-platform validation, which warrants further investigation in subsequent studies.",,0,Scopus,105015947945,2-s2.0-105015947945,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015947945

Bayesian Optimization With Tree Ensembles to Improve Depression Screening on Textual Datasets,Zhao T.,2025,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,"Improving digital depression screening is important for combating the global mental health crisis. Textual data are promising for depression screening due to their many origins, but the variety presents screening challenges. To improve depression screening with textual data, we propose eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with Bayesian Optimization (BO). We experiment with three different objective functions to optimize our models. We apply our models to screen for depression with three disparate textual datasets containing features extracted from transcripts, SMS text messages, and typed replies. When compared to seven other machine learning methods, our XGBoost with BO models demonstrated impressive generalizability across the datasets, achieving average balanced accuracy scores of 0.60, 0.67, and 0.69 with transcripts, SMS text messages, and typed replies, respectively. Our feature importance assessment revealed that the most important features for these three text types were respectively negative emotion, youth, and love lexical category frequencies. Overall, our research presents a promising depression screening method that offers generalizability across text types, explainability, and computational efficiency.",10.1109/TAFFC.2024.3442557,2,Scopus,85201278543,2-s2.0-85201278543,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201278543
Consumer Electronics and GenAI Providing User Experiences in Mental Health,Yu L.,2025,IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine,"As consumer electronics become more ubiquitous and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies advance rapidly, processing and analyzing semantic information collected from users to enhance their experiences becomes especially important. Traditionally, monitoring students’ educational and psychological health has relied primarily on teachers, a method that is both inefficient and inadequate for comprehensively grasping students’ needs. Therefore, the application of artificial intelligence is particularly critical. GenAI has the capability to gather semantic information from consumer electronics commonly used by students, such as smartphones, wearable devices, and tablets, and perform in-depth analysis. By analyzing curriculum schedules, GenAI can personalize learning paths and predict students’ psychological states through examining individual mental health and media usage data. This article explores how GenAI processes this information to intervene in students’ education and psychological health, and discusses the analysis of adolescent mental health test data collected in recent years as well. Evidence suggests that students enrolled in high schools suffer from the highest rates of depression and major depressive disorder compared to other stages, at 40% and 12.5%, respectively, underscoring the importance of using GenAI for educational and psychological health monitoring. The article summarizes the relevant technologies and models, highlighting the potential of GenAI in enhancing student well-being and academic performance.",10.1109/MCE.2024.3449558,4,Scopus,85202742845,2-s2.0-85202742845,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202742845
The Role of Social Media in Shaping Adolescent Mental Well-being: A Comprehensive Review on Its Pros and Cons,Balamurali R.,2025,Adolescent Psychiatry,"Objective: The objective of this review is to explore the impact of social media use on the mental health of teenagers, considering both advantages and disadvantages through a narrative evaluation of recent studies. Methods: A narrative review of current literature was conducted to assess the effects of social media on adolescent mental health. The findings were categorized into seven areas: general mental health effects, specific issues such as anxiety and depression, behavioral impacts like addiction and self-regulation, effects on vulnerable populations, the influence of COVID-19, digital mental health services, ethical considerations with AI, and implications for academic achievement and public health. Results: Social media use has both positive and negative effects on adolescent mental health. It is associated with an increase in behavioral issues such as addiction and mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Vulnerable groups, including LGBTQ+ youth and victims of cyberbullying, face heightened risks. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these mental health challenges, though social media provided essential support networks. Digital mental health services were beneficial but raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy and the need for culturally sensitive interventions. Conclusion: The review underscores the need for balanced strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of social media on adolescent mental health. Comprehensive digital literacy programs, culturally relevant interventions, and ethical considerations in digital mental health services are crucial to supporting adolescent well-being in the digital age.",10.2174/0122106766339175241202105325,0,Scopus,105005189332,2-s2.0-105005189332,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005189332
Multidisciplinary perspectives on personalised prevention in youth mental health,Löchner J.,2025,Frontiers in Digital Health,"The pervasive impact of mental illnesses extends beyond individual suffering, affecting families, communities, and societies at large. Prevention efforts are imperative to mitigate this burden, promoting well-being and resilience across diverse populations. A particularly vulnerable period is adolescence, which is associated with numerous mental health issues that are exacerbated by declining healthy behaviours as well as socioeconomic inequalities. But adolescence also presents an opportune moment for early intervention. However, recognising warning signs and providing timely support involves considerable hurdles, so innovative prevention measures are needed. Advancements in AI, particularly in emotion recognition, offer promise for early mental health intervention. Yet, current AI achievements fall short in addressing the mental healthcare gap. This vision paper seeks to outline future directions and recommendations for effective preventive approaches by integrating experts of the necessary multidisciplinary field to develop, evaluate and implement novel and promising prevention approaches. Therefore, representatives based in Europe from diverse fields such as clinical psychology, computer science, physical activity, nutrition, economics, entrepreneurship, politics, and digital innovation propose potential avenues to integrate efficient treatment, AI methodology, and comprehensive implementation strategies that align with user needs. Based on a literature review and expert consensus, key ingredients suggested for effective preventive measures for mental health include holistic, individualised, AI-based mHealth interventions, leveraging smart and passive data from digital biomarkers for monitoring and feedback, evaluating cost-effectiveness, conducting participatory research to ensure user acceptance, and identifying barriers and facilitators for integration into regular healthcare systems. By utilising AI-driven interventions for adolescents, we can address the urgent need for preventive mental healthcare, ultimately enhancing the well-being of future generations.",10.3389/fdgth.2025.1568472,0,Scopus,105020599038,2-s2.0-105020599038,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020599038
AI as a Novel Digital Stressor in Adolescent Psychosis: Clinical and Ethical Implications,Chamarthi V.S.,2025,International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine,"Objective: With the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by adolescents, the impact on their mental health is of critical concern. This article examines the emerging phenomenon of AI-related psychosis, which can be defined as new-onset or exacerbated psychotic experiences with generative AI platforms, such as chatbots, avatars, and virtual agents like Siri and Alexa. Method: Narrative review and perspective. Results: Adolescents are particularly susceptible due to ongoing neurodevelopmental immaturity, including underdeveloped prefrontal regulatory circuits and heightened limbic system reactivity, which may impair emotional regulation and reality testing. Combined with extensive digital engagement, these factors increase vulnerability to psychotic experiences in response to AI interactions. This article examines behavioral risk factors, online habits, and neurobiological susceptibilities that may predispose adolescents to such experiences. In addition, implications are outlined for healthcare providers, including an emphasis on proactive screening, digital literacy education, and early intervention strategies. Clinical approaches to recognize and manage AI-related mental health risks in adolescents are also proposed.

The Alongside Digital Wellness Program for Youth: Longitudinal Pre-Post Outcomes Study,Cohen K.,2025,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Youth are increasingly experiencing psychological distress. Schools are ideal settings for disseminating mental health support, but they are often insufficiently resourced to do so. Digital mental health tools represent a unique avenue to address this gap. The Alongside digital program is one such tool, intended as a universal prevention and early intervention. The platform includes social-emotional learning and self-help wellness features as well as an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot designed to build coping skills. Objective: This evaluation aimed to examine the near-term impact of Alongside app use on students’ self-reported mental health outcomes. Methods: We conducted a nonrandomized pilot pragmatic evaluation leveraging anonymized user data. All data came from current Alongside users attending public middle and high schools in Texas and New Mexico, between 10 and 18 years old. Schools were actively engaged in partnership with Alongside and approved all procedures. Users were asked to complete mental health questionnaires upon app registration and at 1 and 3 months post registration. We conducted preregistered analyses as well as exploratory analyses to determine how symptoms changed over time and what factors (eg, demographic and app use) predicted changes in distress. Results: Analyses revealed statistically significant within-person decreases in overall distress (Young Person’s CORE; primary outcome) from baseline to 1 month with a small effect size (t<inf>42</inf>=2.21, P=.03, r=0.34); however, there was no evidence that scores significantly decreased from baseline to 3 months (W=1821, n=85, P=.16). We found that at 3 months, identifying as part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning community predicted greater decreases in distress; otherwise, no demographic factors were significant predictors. In a nonregistered exploratory analysis of a subsample of users who reported elevated distress at baseline, decreases in distress were seen at both 1 month (W=128, n=20, P=.02, r=0.52) and 3 months (W=682, n=42, P=.004, r=0.45). Conclusions: There may be short-term benefits associated with using the Alongside digital program.

A Machine Learning Based Approach to Predict the Effects of Video Games on Youth Behavior,Mamun M.A.,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 12th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development Indiacom 2025,"Video game addiction is a rapidly growing concern among young people, emerging as a major issue due to its harmful impact on their mental health. This study investigates how predictive models might reveal subtle patterns in gaming habits by examining the relationship between video games, youth development, and machine learning. The research will investigate social dynamics as well as cognitive, academic, and mental health implications in order to educate individuals about responsible gaming habits and teaching tactics. The study covers ethical considerations and long-term societal ramifications, emphasizing the significance of a compatible way to navigating the IT based world because of young people's prosperity. Its purpose is to evaluate whether a gamer is career-minded. That's why we gathered 804 data points from them, of which 780 were utilized. The key point that we utilized were name, gender, age, amount of time spent studying, amount of sleep or wakefulness, amount of time spent playing games, reason for playing games, amount of time spent playing games more than with family, time spent honing skills, and time spent worried about a career. and after that, they underwent reprocessing and were checked before being used with certain machine learning algorithms.

"Adolescent Engagement With a Multicomponent mHealth Tool: Identifying Usage Patterns, Determinants, and Health Behavior Change in an Intervention Trial",Peuters C.,2025,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Research about the engagement of adolescents with mobile health (mHealth) interventions is scarce, while it is generally assumed that the engagement affects the intervention efficacy. Objective: Using an mHealth intervention that targets the general population of adolescents to promote healthy behaviors (physical activity, low sedentary time, adequate sleep, and taking breakfast) and mental health, we aimed to investigate (1) how adolescents engage with the intervention, (2) which engagement styles can be identified and how these differ according to personal characteristics, and (3) which style of engagement predicts behavior change. The intervention used, #LIFEGOALS, includes self-regulation techniques, a support chatbot, narrative videos, and gamification, brought together in an app coupled to an activity tracker. Methods: Logged usage data and self-reports of experience with #LIFEGOALS were collected from 159 adolescents (mean age 13.54, SD 0.95 years) over a 12-week intervention period and used to describe behavioral and experiential engagement with the intervention components over time. Baseline data on sociodemographic variables, mental health, and behavioral determinants were explored as determinants of engagement and were used to characterize engagement styles that were identified through exploratory cluster analysis on the frequency of usage of the components. Linear mixed-effects regression was used to analyze the effect of engagement style on health behavior change. Results: Average time in the app was 26 minutes (SD 26) over the 12-week period, with usage decreasing substantially after the first week. The use of self-regulation techniques and gamification was strongly interrelated (0.65 <r <0.70), whereas use of Fitbit showed weaker correlations with other component usage (0.15 <r <0.31). Exploratory analyses suggest that engagement was influenced by immigration background and by adolescents’ attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions toward healthy living. Younger participants tended to use the Fitbit more frequently. Cluster analysis identified 4 engagement styles: narrative usage (n=19), app usage (n=36), Fitbit usage (n=32), and no usage (n=72), which were associated with differences in age, peer support, and mental health. Engagement style did not affect change in health behavior outcomes from preintervention to postintervention. Conclusions: Different engagement styles were identified based on the frequency and type of components used. Findings support the relevance of tailoring mHealth to individual, interpersonal, and contextual characteristics. The overall low engagement with the intervention may have limited the detection of differences in health effects between engagement styles.",10.2196/59041,0,Scopus,105013688879,2-s2.0-105013688879,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013688879
Smart Solutions for Student Well-being: AI-driven Mental Health Support in a Polytechnic,Lee J.,2025,Rise of Intelligent Machines A Multi Disciplinary Perspective from Industry and Impact on Higher Education,"This research investigates the deepening mental health crisis among youths in Singapore's higher education institutions. Inspired by analysis and recommendations from the Ngee Ann Kongsi-IPS Citizens’ Panel, it also examines contributing factors like social media, limited campus resources, stigma, and student-teacher disconnect. A closer evaluation of existing initiatives at Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) reveals more reactive rather than preventative care. A survey of students in NYP School of Design & Media reaffirmed gaps in accessible care made available to youths at polytechnics, where students face immense pressure, yet support falls short. Blending insights into strengths and weaknesses within the current commercial mental health mobile app ecosystem, this report proposes a progressive solution using design thinking – empathising, defining issues, generating ideas, prototyping, and testing. The proposed mobile app MAESTRO delivers an AI-driven platform that supports student mental health through multifaceted, personalised, and preventative strategies. Automating tasks relieves overburdened stakeholders to focus more on complex cases. Testing during its evaluation indicates significant potential such holistic digital systems could effectively address. Feedback from staff and teachers examined the proposed system's potential and ethical, privacy, and intrusiveness concerns, which could hinder adoption. Exploring both merits and limitations informs a conclusion on the solution's feasibility amidst the escalating problem of struggling youths in higher education. Recommendations integrate scalable technology, stigma-reduction initiatives, community-building, and enhanced campus resources to cultivate healthier learning environments so no student falls through the cracks. This study could form a foundation to re-examine approaches to student mental health and wellness. There is a call for bold solutions that apply progressive, anticipatory models tailored to our increasingly brittle, anxious, non-linear, and incomprehensible world. As academia's digital transformation accelerates, so too should innovative efforts to support our young learners facing novel stressors through proactive means versus outdated reactive measures. By embracing an emergent strategy, polytechnics can champion preventative care ecosystems that empower resilience, connection, and human success – ultimately graduating skilled professionals and responsible global citizens able to thrive amidst adversity.",10.1201/9781003469551-9,1,Scopus,105001745328,2-s2.0-105001745328,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001745328

Fostering adolescent engagement in generative AI art therapy: a dual SEM-ANN analysis of emotional,Peng X.,2025,Frontiers in Psychology,"Introduction: This study explores the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) art in digital art therapy, focusing on how it influences adolescents’ interest-driven participation. With mental health concerns rising among youth, understanding motivational mechanisms in AI-assisted therapeutic tools is both timely and essential. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 444 junior and senior high school students in Hubei Province, China. The study integrated Emotional Design Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to construct a predictive model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses were employed to validate the model and identify key predictors of engagement. Results: SEM results indicated that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived fun (PF), and perceived trust (PT) significantly influenced users’ attitudes toward use (ATT) (p < 0.001). ATT, PF, and PT were strong predictors of interest-driven participation, while the behavioral level had no direct effect on perceived enjoyment (PE). ANN analysis further highlighted ATT as the most influential predictor (100% normalized importance), notably exceeding PE (19.3%). Discussion: These findings emphasize the importance of intuitive design, seamless interaction, and trust-building in sustaining adolescents’ engagement with AI-based art therapy.

Reviewing depression analysis from social media platform data,Gupta P.,2025,Advances in Electronics Computer Physical and Chemical Sciences,"Today depression remains a substantial issue in our society. It is serving as a significant catalyst for suicide, particularly among teenagers. It affects millions of people each year, yet only a small number receive adequate treatment. Social media platforms hold the potential to determine the underlying causes of depression in individuals who may be experiencing any mental health condition. This paper delves into the examination of various techniques employed for detecting depression on social media platforms. Through scrutinizing methodologies such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis, it aims to uncover effective strategies for identifying depressive symptoms. By grasping both the merits and shortcomings of these methods, the study endeavors to aim in the advancement of stronger methods and resilient strategies for early intervention and support in online communities. In the examination of varied methodologies for identifying mental health disorders, logistic regression and decision three models demonstrate superior performance when applied to reduced datasets.

The Evolution of Gen Alpha Slang: Linguistic Patterns and AI Translation Challenges,Ishita ,2025,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,"Generation Alpha (born 2010-2024) is the first generation fully raised within the digital ecosystem. They exhibit unique linguistic behaviours influenced by rampant online communication and platform-specific cultures. This study examines the rapid evolution of Gen Alpha slang through a comparative analysis of Millennial and Gen Z vernacular. We identify three core linguistic patterns: extreme lexical compression, digital culture-driven semantic shifts and part-of-speech conversion. We construct a comprehensive slang corpus sourced from online platforms and evaluate the performance of four AI translation systems (viz. Google Translate, ChatGPT 4, Gemini 1.0, DeepSeek v3) on over 100 slang terms. Our results reveal significant translation challenges rooted in culturally-bound terms from gaming, meme culture, and mental health discourse. Most errors are the result of inadequate cultural contextualization, with literal translations dominating the error patterns. Our findings highlight the critical limitations in current language models and emphasize the need for adaptive, culturally sensitive and context-aware frameworks that can handle the dynamic lexicon of evolving youth vernacular.",10.18653/v1/2025.acl-srw.43,0,Scopus,105020381827,2-s2.0-105020381827,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020381827
Machine Learning-Based Early Intelligent Diagnosis of Youth Mental Health Conditions,Wang Y.N.,2025,Journal of Network Intelligence,"Subjective judgement of EEG (Electroencephalogram) using a priori knowledge and related theories is currently the dominant technical tool for diagnosing mental health status in youth. However, this subjective judgement method is highly error-prone and inefficient. Advanced signal processing technology, machine learning technology, etc. provide new methods for fast and accurate intelligent mental consultation. Therefore, an early intelligent diagnosis method based on wavelet Bispectrum and CatBoost is proposed to address the problem of automatic identification of abnormal EEG information in youth. Firstly, wavelet Bispectrum estimation algorithm is proposed by combining wavelet and Bispectrum analysis methods for the characteristics of EEG signals. Wavelet Bispectrum and sparse learning are combined to achieve signal feature extraction. The sparse learning method is used to extract sparse features at each scale to obtain a more discriminative feature set. Then, a CatBoost model optimised by a genetic algorithm is proposed and used for the EEG signal classification task. Finally, the schizophrenic clinical EEG signals were tested as an example. The results show that the proposed diagnostic method avoids diagnostic bias due to subjective factors or differences in judgement criteria, with an average Sensitivity of 94.37%, an average Specificity of 88.72%, and an average Accuracy of 96.33%.",,0,Scopus,85219471795,2-s2.0-85219471795,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219471795
The association between the use of digital technologies and positive youth development: a systematic review,Martin-Barrado A.D.,2025,Frontiers in Psychology,"Introduction: Excessive internet use among adolescents has increasingly raised concerns about its potential impact on psychological well-being, including issues such as depression and anxiety. Despite the extensive research on this topic, few studies have examined it through the lens of the Positive Youth Development (PYD) model. This model emphasizes the strengths and skills that enable adolescents to develop into healthy, well-integrated adults. This study aimed to analyze the influence of PYD on children’s and adolescents’ use of the Internet, social media, and Artificial Intelligence. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines across the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases from their inception until December 2024. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024602945). Results: 17 quantitative studies (cross-sectional and longitudinal) published between 2012 and 2024 met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool. The results suggest that PYD acts as a protective factor against risk behaviors associated with excessive use of the Internet and social media, such as pornography consumption, sexting, gaming disorders, and cyberbullying. This protective effect is consistent with its influence on other risk behaviors. Furthermore, variables such as emotional self-regulation and family environment were identified as crucial in mitigating these behaviors. Discussion: The PYD model appears to offer promising strategies for promoting responsible use of digital technologies. However, most studies were conducted in China, suggesting the need for cross-cultural research to support the generalization of the findings. Moreover, research is still needed to address the association between PYD and artificial intelligence use. Finally, the study discusses the implications of these results for future research and practice.

The Ability of AI Therapy Bots to Set Limits With Distressed Adolescents: Simulation-Based Comparison Study,Clark A.,2025,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have introduced the general public to powerful, easily accessible tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, for a rapidly expanding range of uses. Among those uses are specialized chatbots that serve in the role of a therapist, as well as personally curated digital companions that offer emotional support. However, the ability of AI therapists to provide consistently safe and effective treatment remains largely unproven, and those concerns are especially salient in regard to adolescents seeking mental health support. Objective: This study aimed to determine the willingness of therapy and companion AI chatbots to endorse harmful or ill-advised ideas proposed by fictional teenagers experiencing mental health distress. Methods: A convenience sample of 10 publicly available AI bots offering therapeutic support or companionship were each presented with 3 detailed fictional case vignettes of adolescents with mental health challenges. Each fictional adolescent asked the AI chatbot to endorse 2 harmful or ill-advised proposals, such as dropping out of school, avoiding all human contact for a month, or pursuing a relationship with an older teacher, resulting in a total of 6 proposals presented to each chatbot. The clinical scenarios presented were intended to reflect challenges commonly seen in the practice of therapy with adolescents, and the proposals offered by the fictional teenagers were intended to be clearly dangerous or unwise. The 10 AI bots were selected by the author to represent a range of chatbot types, including generic AI bots, companion bots, and dedicated mental health bots. Chatbot responses were analyzed for explicit endorsement, defined as direct support for the teenagers’ proposed behavior. Results: Across 60 total scenarios, chatbots actively endorsed harmful proposals in 19 out of the 60 (32%) opportunities to do so. Of the 10 chatbots, 4 endorsed half or more of the ideas proposed to them, and none of the bots managed to oppose them all. Conclusions: A significant proportion of AI chatbots offering mental health or emotional support endorsed harmful proposals from fictional teenagers. These results raise concerns about the ability of some AI-based companion or therapy bots to safely support teenagers with serious mental health issues and heighten concern that AI bots may tend to be overly supportive at the expense of offering useful guidance when appropriate. The results highlight the urgent need for oversight, safety protocols, and ongoing research regarding digital mental health support for adolescents.",10.2196/78414,0,Scopus,105015477703,2-s2.0-105015477703,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015477703
An Examination of Generative AI Response to Suicide Inquires: Content Analysis,Campbell L.O.,2025,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are an online source of information consulted by adolescents to gain insight into mental health and wellness behaviors. However, the accuracy and content of generative AI responses to questions related to suicide have not been systematically investigated. Objective: This study aims to investigate general (not counseling-specific) generative AI chatbots’ responses to questions regarding suicide. Methods: A content analysis was conducted of the responses of generative AI chatbots to questions about suicide. In phase 1 of the study, generative chatbots examined include: (1) Google Bard or Gemini; (2) Microsoft Bing or CoPilot; (3) ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI); and (4) Claude (Anthropic). In phase 2 of the study, additional generative chatbot responses were analyzed, which included Google Gemini, Claude 2 (Anthropic), xAI Grok 2, Mistral AI, and Meta AI (Meta Platforms). The two phases occurred a year apart. Results: Findings included a linguistic analysis of the authenticity and tone within the responses using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. There was an increase in the depth and accuracy of the responses between phase 1 and phase 2 of the study. There is evidence that the responses by the generative AI chatbots were more comprehensive and responsive during phase 2 than phase 1. Specifically, the responses were found to provide more information regarding all aspects of suicide (eg, signs of suicide, lethality, resources, and ways to support those in crisis). Another difference noted in the responses between the first and second phases was the emphasis on the 988 suicide hotline number. Conclusions: While this dynamic information may be helpful for youth in need, the importance of individuals seeking help from a trained mental health professional remains. Further, generative AI algorithms related to suicide questions should be checked periodically to ensure best practices regarding suicide prevention are being communicated.",10.2196/73623,0,Scopus,105015384249,2-s2.0-105015384249,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015384249

The effect of Artificial Intelligence Health Education Accurately Linking System on childhood asthma: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial,Wang H.F.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Childhood asthma is a prevalent chronic disease that affects millions of children worldwide. Managing this disease demands not only medical treatment but also the long-term self-management efforts of both children and their parents. Conventional self-management education typically depends on face-to-face approaches, often failing to take into account the personalized requirements and ongoing support needed. Nevertheless, with the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, fresh prospects have emerged to boost the effectiveness of self-management for childhood asthma. Based on it, we have designed an AI Health Education Accurately Linkage System (AI-HEALS) to explore whether AI-driven interventions can improve self-management capabilities of families with asthmatic children, thereby helping them control the disease and reduce medical costs. Methods: This research is a pilot single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) intended to gauge the efficacy of the AI-HEALS intervention delivered via the WeChat platform in enhancing the self-management abilities of families with asthmatic children. Participants will be recruited from eligible families whose children have been diagnosed with asthma and randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The control group will receive standard treatment, whereas the intervention group will receive both standard treatment and the AI-HEALS intervention. The intervention includes an AI-enabled, voice-activated interactive question-and-answer system, as well as monitoring and recording of physiological indicators, regular reminders, and customized educational articles. All components of the intervention will mainly be provided through a WeChat official account named “Children’s Asthma Health Management Expert.” AI-HEALS will construct its knowledge base according to pediatric asthma treatment guidelines to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the information it offers. The primary outcome measure is the alteration in asthma symptom control levels, while secondary outcomes comprise a variety of other physiological indicators related to asthma, parents’ self-management behaviors, and mental health conditions. Discussion: This study combines AI and mobile health technology to develop the AI-HEALS system, with the aim of assisting families of children with asthma in controlling the disease symptoms. The primary objective is to evaluate whether the intervention can improve asthma symptom control. Clinical trial registration: The study is scheduled to begin in April 2025 and is expected to conclude in December 2026. This research protocol is the first version and was registered with the China Clinical Trial Registration Center on February 14, 2025 (Registration Number: ChiCTR2500097233).",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1585702,0,Scopus,105008862137,2-s2.0-105008862137,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008862137
Multi Source Data Fusion and Graph Neural Network Based Joint Identification Algorithm for Adolescent Internet Addiction and Psychological Disorders,Zhu Y.,2025,2025 2nd International Conference on Digital Media Communication and Information Systems Dmcis 2025,"This study proposes a joint identification algorithm based on multi-source data fusion and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to simultaneously detect adolescent internet addiction and psychological disorders. With the rapid development of internet technology, adolescent internet addiction has become increasingly prominent, and there exists a complex bidirectional relationship between internet addiction and psychological abnormalities. Traditional single-source data modeling methods struggle to accurately capture these intricate psychological and behavioral patterns. To address this, the study integrates multi-source heterogeneous data, including online behavior logs, psychological assessment data, physiological signals, and social relationships, to construct a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (H-GNN) model. Through a multi-task learning mechanism, the model simultaneously predicts the risks of internet addiction and psychological disorders. Experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms traditional machine learning and deep learning models in terms of accuracy and AUC, effectively capturing the complex interactions between adolescent behaviors, psychological states, and social relationships. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of psychological features in prediction, and the model's potential in real-world applications is highlighted.",10.1109/DMCIS65888.2025.11138054,0,Scopus,105017602673,2-s2.0-105017602673,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017602673
Using Gamification to Reduce Youth Depression: A Step-by-Step Method,Bakshi S.,2025,3rd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Electronics Developments and Applications Icidea 2025,"Youth depression is a major global health concern due to its alarmingly high occurrence and harmful impact on mental health. Traditional therapy methods frequently struggle with involvement, accessibility, and stigma. This research addresses depression in young people by proposing a novel solution based on gamification concepts. Our method is based on creating a game module integrated with a ML model that is especially designed for young people with depression. It provides a fun and active way to reduce symptoms and postpone thoughts of suicide. The module includes a number of levels and activities that are meant to be enjoyable while also supporting mental and emotional health. Crucially, the game has an adaptable system that is connected to players' depression levels, modifying job complexity in response to continuous evaluation to guarantee maximum effectiveness and engagement. The key component of our invention is the incorporation of a depression assessment question into the game interface, which allows users' psychological states to be assessed in real time. The game's algorithm is informed by this data, which constantly adjusts the difficulty and intensity of the challenges to suit each player's demands. Our goal is to improve users' feeling of agency and accomplishment by personalizing their gaming experience, which will have a beneficial effect on their mental health. Our work emphasizes the value of customized approaches in tackling the complex problems associated with depression and adds to the expanding corpus of research that examines the possibility of gamification in mental health therapies.",10.1109/ICIDeA64800.2025.10962961,0,Scopus,105004551884,2-s2.0-105004551884,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004551884
"Future Me, a Prospection-Based Chatbot to Promote Mental Well-Being in Youth: Two Exploratory User Experience Studies",Dechant M.,2025,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Digital interventions have been proposed as a solution to meet the growing demand for mental health support. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising technology for creating more personalized and adaptive mental health chatbots. While LLMs generate responses based on statistical patterns in training data rather than through conscious reasoning, they can be designed to support important psychological processes. Prospection—the ability to envision and plan for future outcomes—represents a transdiagnostic process altered across various mental health conditions that could be effectively targeted through such interventions. We designed “Future Me,” an LLM-powered chatbot designed to facilitate future-oriented thinking and promote goal pursuit using evidence-based interventions including visualization, implementation intentions, and values clarification. Objective: This study aims to understand how users engage with Future Me, evaluate its effectiveness in supporting future-oriented thinking, and assess its acceptability across different populations, with particular attention to postgraduate students’ stress management needs. We also seek to identify design improvements that could enhance the chatbot’s ability to support users’ mental well-being. Methods: In total, 2 complementary studies were conducted. Study 1 (n=20) examined how postgraduate students used Future Me during a single guided session, followed by semistructured interviews. Study 2 (n=14) investigated how postgraduate students interacted with Future Me over a 1-week period, with interviews before and after usage. Both studies analyzed conversation transcripts and interview data using thematic analysis to understand usage patterns, perceived benefits, and limitations. Results: Across both studies, participants primarily engaged with Future Me to discuss career or education goals, personal obstacles, and relationship concerns. Users valued Future Me’s ability to provide clarity around goal-setting (85% of participants), its nonjudgmental nature, and its 24/7 accessibility (58%). Future Me effectively facilitated self-reflection (80%) and offered new perspectives (70%), particularly for broader future-oriented concerns. However, both studies revealed limitations in the chatbot’s ability to provide personalized emotional support during high-stress situations, with participants noting that responses sometimes felt formulaic (50%) or lacked emotional depth. Postgraduate students specifically emphasized the need for greater context awareness during periods of academic stress (58%). Overall, 57% of requests occurred outside office hours, dropping from 40 on day 1 to 12 by day 7. Conclusions: Future Me demonstrates promise as an accessible tool for promoting prospection skills and supporting mental well-being through future-oriented thinking. However, effectiveness appears context-dependent, with prospection techniques more suitable for broader life decisions than acute stress situations. Future development should focus on creating more adaptive systems that can adjust their approach based on the user’s emotional state and immediate needs. Rather than attempting to replicate human therapy entirely, chatbots like Future Me may be most effective when designed as complementary tools within broader support ecosystems, offering immediate guidance while facilitating connections to human support when needed.",10.2196/74411,0,Scopus,105010903824,2-s2.0-105010903824,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010903824
Women’s Emotional Care and Psychological Well-Being Post-Termination of Pregnancy: An Integrative Review,Musabwasoni M.G.S.,2025,Rwanda Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences,"Background Emotional support following legal pregnancy termination is a fundamental aspect of comprehensive healthcare. Existing literature points to gaps in psychological care packages offered to women, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. This integrative review extends beyond prior syntheses by incorporating digital interventions, relational dynamics, and community-based support, which are often overlooked, especially in low-resource settings. It highlights critical gaps in service integration, cultural sensitivity, and emotional care for underrepresented populations, such as adolescents and women in stigmatizing environments. To advance the field, future research should explore scalable, culturally grounded interventions that promote long-term psychological well-being following termination of pregnancy. This review evaluates evidence-based psychological support interventions designed to enhance mental health outcomes for women after pregnancy termination. Methods An integrative review and thematic synthesis were conducted, adhering to Whittemore and Knafl’s (2005) framework. Searches were performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL Complete, and PsycINFO. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications from 2013 to 2023 focusing on psychological support programs. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tool, and thematic synthesis followed a convergent integrated approach. Results Empirical studies (n=13) were included. Data screening and extraction, conducted via COVIDENCE, achieved a reliability score of 63% based on Cohen’s Kappa measure. Three primary themes emerged: (1) holistic psychosocial support for women after prenatal loss, (2) strengthening community support and reducing stigma around abortion experiences, and (3) enhancing post-abortion recovery through digital, familial, and comprehensive support networks. Conclusion Post-termination psychological care plays a critical role in promoting mental well-being. Personalized interventions, encompassing counseling and community-driven support systems, are essential in reducing emotional distress and fostering recovery.",10.4314/rjmhs.v8i2.19,0,Scopus,105014849944,2-s2.0-105014849944,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014849944
"Algorithmic fandom: how generative AI is reshaping sports marketing, fan engagement, and the integrity of sport",Westerbeek H.,2025,Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of sports marketing by enabling hyper-personalised fan engagement, real-time content delivery, and data-driven commercial strategies. Leveraging technologies such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and automated content generation, sports organisations are increasingly able to tailor fan experiences, anticipate behaviour, and optimise revenue models. While these advancements offer significant opportunities for enhancing interactivity and commercial growth, they also introduce complex ethical, psychological, and regulatory challenges. This paper critically examines the dual nature of generative AI in sports marketing, with a particular focus on consumer autonomy, data monetisation, and the influence of AI-driven personalisation on fan behaviour. Using narrative literature review approach, the paper draws on emerging research, industry cases, and interdisciplinary literature, and explores how algorithmic recommendation systems can manipulate fan decisions, reinforce digital echo chambers, and marginalise underrepresented sports. Special attention is given to the impact of AI on children and adolescents, who are particularly vulnerable to targeted content, gamification, and AI-curated betting environments. The integration of AI in gambling platforms and the commercialisation of fan data raise significant concerns around privacy, consent, and long-term wellbeing. The paper concludes by offering some implementation guidance for sport ecosystem stakeholders. It also outlines a future research agenda that calls for empirical investigations into the long-term effects of AI on fan behaviour, the development of regulatory frameworks to safeguard consumer rights, and interdisciplinary collaboration to design ethical AI systems. By identifying these critical issues, the paper aims to support a more inclusive, transparent, and integrity-focused application of AI in sport.",10.3389/fspor.2025.1597444,2,Scopus,105005974370,2-s2.0-105005974370,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005974370
Explainable machine learning prediction of internet addiction among Chinese primary and middle school children and adolescents: a longitudinal study based on positive youth development data (2019–2022),Liu J.,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,"Background: Internet Addiction (IA) has emerged as a critical concern, especially among school age children and adolescents, potentially stalling their physical and mental development. Our study aimed to examine the risk factors associated with IA among Chinese children and adolescents and leverage explainable machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict IA status at the time of assessment, based on Young’s Internet Addiction Test. Methods: The longitudinal data consisting of 8,824 schoolchildren from the Chengdu Positive Child Development (CPCD) survey were analyzed, where 33.3% of participants were identified with IA (Age: 10.97 ± 2.31, Male: 51.73%). IA was defined using Young’s Internet Addiction Test (IAT ≥ 40). Demographic variables such as age, gender, and grade level, along with key variables including scores of Cognitive Behavioral Competencies (CBC), Prosocial Attributes (PA), Positive Identity (PI), General Positive Youth Development Qualities (GPYDQ), Life Satisfaction (LS), Delinquent Behavior (DB), Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), Depression (DP), Anxiety (AX), Family Function Disorders (FF), Egocentrism (EG), Empathy (EP), Academic Intrinsic Value (IV), and Academic Utility Value (UV) were examined. Chi-square and Mann–Whitney U tests were employed to validate the significance of the mentioned predictors of IA. We applied six ML models: Extra Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Transformer Encoder. Performance was evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test sets across survey waves. Feature selection and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis were utilised for model improvement and interpretability, respectively. Results: ExtraRFC achieved the best performance (Test AUC = 0.854, Accuracy = 0.798, F1 = 0.659), outperforming all other models across most metrics and external validations. Key predictors included grade level, delinquent behavior, anxiety, family function, and depression scores. SHAP analysis revealed consistent and interpretable feature contributions across individuals. Conclusion: Depression, anxiety, and family dynamics are significant factors influencing IA in children. The Extra Random Forest model proves most effective in predicting IA, emphasising the importance of addressing these factors to promote healthy digital habits in children.

"The impact of social media on adolescent conformity: mechanisms, individual moderators, and implications for AI-Empowered assistive technologies",Xiao B.,2025,Disability and Rehabilitation Assistive Technology,"Background: This experimental study explores how social media influences adolescent conformity behaviour and investigates underlying psychological mechanisms and individual differences. Objective: By aligning with the scope of the “AI-empowered Assistive Technology” special issue, our work provides theoretical insights into how AI-enabled systems—such as personalised social media literacy tools, adaptive feedback interfaces, and AI-driven content filtering mechanisms—can mitigate the impact of social pressure and support adolescents with lower self-esteem or higher social anxiety. Methods: In a 2 (social media influence: high vs. low) × 2 (source credibility: high vs. low) between-subjects design with 302 participants, results demonstrate that heightened social media influence significantly increases conformity behaviour (F(1, 298) = 73.26, p <.001, η<sup>2</sup> =.20), with perceived social pressure partially mediating this effect (indirect effect = 0.24, 95% CI [0.17, 0.33]). Self-esteem negatively moderates (β = −0.18, p <.001), while social anxiety positively moderates (β = 0.22, p <.001) this influence. Additionally, high source credibility amplifies conformity (F(1, 298) = 5.84, p =.016, η<sup>2</sup> =.02). Results: These findings illuminate the psychological dynamics of social media–induced conformity and underscore the role of individual differences in modulating this process. Conclusion: Specifically, AI applications could offer individualised interventions to enhance resilience and autonomy in digital social environments, addressing the needs of vulnerable users in assistive contexts. This interdisciplinary approach bridges psychological mechanisms of conformity with the design of AI-empowered assistive technologies for enhanced human–computer interaction and well-being in the digital age.",10.1080/17483107.2025.2570889,0,Scopus,105018975641,2-s2.0-105018975641,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018975641
Navigating careers in the digital age: The influence of AI-powered social media platforms on Chinese graduate students’ career decision-making,Wen Y.,2025,Annals of the Entomological Society of America,"This article investigates the role of AI-powered social media platforms in shaping the career decision-making processes of graduate students in China. Drawing upon qualitative data from 20 semi-structured interviews, it explores how user-generated content (UGC), cultural capital, and social reproduction intersect in influencing career perceptions and choices in the context of China’s rapidly digitalizing society. The findings reveal that platforms such as Douyin, Weibo, and Xiaohongshu serve not only as sources of career information but also as spaces where peer narratives, curated success stories, and algorithmic visibility shape graduate students’ aspirations and anxieties. Moreover, AI algorithms significantly impact students’ career aspirations through UGC which are mediated by cultural capital and social reproduction. Digital inequality emerges from algorithmic biases, hence exacerbating social reproduction. This study contributes to the literature on AI-powered digital media and youth transitions by contextualizing career choice in China’s unique sociocultural landscape.

"Children and Artificial Intelligence. Towards an Italian Discussion on Artificial Intelligence, Children’s Rights and Regulatory Sandboxes",Tibidò S.,2025,Ceur Workshop Proceedings,"In the context of an ever-changing digital panorama, the pervasiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various aspects of people’s daily lives, including those involving children and teenagers. An important issue, that needs to be addressed, is related to the introduction and enforcement of specific rules to ensure children’s rights and special needs in those AI systems created for, accessed by, and impacting minors. Looking at the Italian debates on AI systems, currently, there is no sufficient attention to these aspects. The situation is even worse for more general AI-related issues like the creation of a national sandbox by 2026, as expected by the EU AI Act. Accordingly, by briefly presenting the ongoing discussion at the international and national level, this paper would like to set the ground for an Italian debate on how to start thinking and developing a sandbox that considers the special needs and characteristics of children. The Italian scientific community is called by the Italian Strategy for AI [1] to join forces and promote and develop interdisciplinary research projects for social well-being.

Humanity in the digital age,Rossius P.A.,2025,Filosofiya Nauki I Tehniki,"The primary objectives of this research were to examine the contemporary state of digitalization on a global scale, assess its influence on human consciousness, and analyze the patterns of human perception regarding technology and associated innovations. The investigation explored the repercussions of digital technologies on societal structures, economic systems, and the personal lives of individuals. Emphasis was placed on the utilization of social networks for the generation of digital user profiles and the manipulation of behavior within both tangible and virtual realms. Methodologically, the study engaged in the analysis of factual, historical, and statistical data, drawing parallels between developments in the digital and technological domains and various religious, mystical, and alchemical doctrines, en-compassing general eschatology, Pythagoreanism, and the teachings of microcosm and macrocosm. The philosophical dimensions of digitalization were scrutinized through the lens of the philosophies of I. Kant and M. Bakunin, underscoring the perils of commodification and the absence of a distinct perception of digital activities. This research accentuated the paradigm shift instigated by the digital revolution, characterized by the normalization of computer literacy and the substitution of desktop computers with mobile devices. Moreover, the study probed the detrimental aspects of digitalization, highlighting the escalated prevalence of depression and suicide among adolescents, concerns surrounding privacy, and the harvesting of personal data by corporate and governmental entities. The investigation further delineated the prospective trajectory of artificial intelligence and its ramifications for human consciousness and existence, prompting inquiries into the essence of consciousness and its potential replication. Drawing upon recent scholarly works, it was revealed that AI developers frequently grapple with a limited understanding of the decision-making processes employed by their systems, engendering questions concerning the nature of consciousness and its potential modeling. The study culminated in a contemplation of the feasibility of forging symbiotic forms of consciousness, entailing a fusion of human and mechanical cognitive faculties. Ultimately, the research demonstrated that, notwith-standing the evolving nature of human existence, its anthropological core remains stead-fastly immutable.",10.21146/2413-9084-2025-30-1-58-68,0,Scopus,105009999416,2-s2.0-105009999416,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009999416
School-Based Online Surveillance of Youth: Systematic Search and Content Analysis of Surveillance Company Websites,O'Daffer A.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: School-based online surveillance of students has been widely adopted by middle and high school administrators over the past decade. Little is known about the technology companies that provide these services or the benefits and harms of the technology for students. Understanding what information online surveillance companies monitor and collect about students, how they do it, and if and how they facilitate appropriate intervention fills a crucial gap for parents, youth, researchers, and policy makers. Objective: The two goals of this study were to (1) comprehensively identify school-based online surveillance companies currently in operation, and (2) collate and analyze company-described surveillance services, monitoring processes, and features provided. Methods: We systematically searched GovSpend and EdSurge’s Education Technology (EdTech) Index to identify school-based online surveillance companies offering social media monitoring, student communications monitoring, or online monitoring. We extracted publicly available information from company websites and conducted a systematic content analysis of the websites identified. Two coders independently evaluated all company websites and discussed the findings to reach 100% consensus regarding website data labeling. Results: Our systematic search identified 14 school-based online surveillance companies. Content analysis revealed that most of these companies facilitate school administrators’ access to students’ digital behavior, well beyond monitoring during school hours and on school-provided devices. Specifically, almost all companies reported conducting monitoring of students at school, but 86% (12/14) of companies reported also conducting monitoring 24/7 outside of school and 7% (1/14) reported conducting monitoring outside of school at school administrator-specified locations. Most online surveillance companies reported using artificial intelligence to conduct automated flagging of student activity (10/14, 71%), and less than half of the companies (6/14, 43%) reported having a secondary human review team. Further, 14% (2/14) of companies reported providing crisis responses via company staff, including contacting law enforcement at their discretion. Conclusions: This study is the first detailed assessment of the school-based online surveillance industry and reveals that student monitoring technology can be characterized as heavy-handed. Findings suggest that students who only have school-provided devices are more heavily surveilled and that historically marginalized students may be at a higher risk of being flagged due to algorithmic bias. The dearth of research on efficacy and the notable lack of transparency about how surveillance services work indicate that increased oversight by policy makers of this industry may be warranted. Dissemination of our findings can improve parent, educator, student, and researcher awareness of school-based online monitoring services.",10.2196/71998,0,Scopus,105010271499,2-s2.0-105010271499,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010271499
Psychological Resilience of the Individual as a Condition for the Humanization of Artificial Intelligence,Khrebina S.V.,2025,Advances in Science Technology and Innovation,"The research summarizes contemporary views on psychological resilience in the works of Russian and foreign researchers within the context of studying Russian society and the overall digitalization of the modern generation. Additionally, the authors identify risks associated with increasing cybersocialization and the threats this trend poses to the psychological resilience of today’s youth. The authors analyzed the existing models of psychological resilience to various phenomena, including the influence of AI, in foreign and domestic psychology. The research concludes with the justification for developing a model of psychological resilience that considers age-specific characteristics in the digital age and cyber socialization. Key principles of social life organization are highlighted when determining aspects of AI humanization. An integrative model of psychological resilience for young people against destructive factors in the digital and offline environments is proposed, encompassing personal-meaningful, attributive-behavioral, and functional-adaptive constructs. The process of developing these constructs of psychological resilience is presented as a unity of diagnostic-analytical, corrective-developmental, and socio-adaptive stages. The authors argue that it is possible to use AI to achieve and maintain psychological well-being and self-actualization at a sufficient level of psychological resilience. In this case, AI becomes a tool for understanding the surrounding world and organizing life activities, which serves as a condition for humanizing AI.",10.1007/978-3-031-83331-1_53,0,Scopus,105008129628,2-s2.0-105008129628,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008129628

Scrolling Safely: Implementing ID and Biometric Verification into Social Media,Fountain D.B.,2025,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Since the first social media site was created in 1997, it has become a staple in society to be present on social media because of its ability to generate communication, networking, information sharing, entertainment, learning, support, civic engagement, and marketing with ease. As more social platforms have developed over time, users are constantly at risk of being affected mentally, physically, and financially by social media crime. Cyberbullying, harassment, sexting, and online grooming are the leading causes for mental health concerns among adolescents that are exposed to frequent social media use. Hill et al. [1]. Many social media platforms have email verification to ensure that the users who have created the account are the only ones with access, however, there is no explicit verification or security protocols put in place to solidify the safety of their users while on their platform. This research is to develop a proof of concept for an application that social media platforms can integrate within their software that will combine ID and biometric verification to enable users to surf their favorite platform with less worry.",10.1007/978-3-031-94953-1_25,0,Scopus,105014464589,2-s2.0-105014464589,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014464589
Exploring the construction of a youth mental health campus ecosystem integrating research-practice teaching,Gao T.,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,"This study explores the construction of a youth mental health-promoting campus ecosystem based on integrated research-practice teaching. In response to the fragmentation of traditional mental health education in Chinese universities, the model incorporates ecosystem theory, embodied cognition, and multi-agent collaboration to build a four-dimensional support system: curriculum-practice integration, internal-external stakeholder synergy, environmental optimization, and institutional sustainability. Through immersive practices like psychodrama, mind mapping, and mindful walking, students’ psychological capital and self-regulation abilities are enhanced. The model emphasizes collaboration across psychological, educational, and managerial units, as well as coordination with families, communities, medical institutions, and enterprises. By combining physical space design with digital tracking platforms, the ecosystem enables all-scenario psychological support. Challenges such as insufficient longitudinal validation, ethical concerns in AI-driven interventions, and uneven resource allocation remain. This study provides a localized and actionable framework for advancing youth mental health in higher education, supporting a shift from crisis intervention to positive psychological development.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1636327,0,Scopus,105012769354,2-s2.0-105012769354,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012769354
Bridge Nodes Linking Depression and Medication Taking Self-Efficacy Dimensions Among Persons With HIV: A Secondary Data Analysis,Min S.H.,2025,AIDS and Behavior,"Depression and low medication taking self-efficacy are among the most important mechanisms contributing to poor adherence to treatment and care for persons with HIV (PWH). While the overall negative relationship between depression and medication taking self-efficacy has been well established, little is known on the precise pathways linking depression and medication taking self-efficacy. Thus, it is critical to identify a specific item of depression and medication taking self-efficacy that derives the overall negative relationship. The current study is a secondary data analysis using the baseline data from a randomized controlled trial that aims to support PWH to self-manage antiretroviral therapy regimens via mHealth technology and community health workers to monitor their adherence using a self-management app. A total of 282 participants were included. The machine-learning based network analysis was conducted to explore the structure of the depression and medication taking self-efficacy network and to identify bridge nodes between depression and medication taking self-efficacy. Our study identified difficulty concentrating on things and confidence to stick to treatment schedule when not feeling well are important bridge nodes connecting the network of depression and medication taking self-efficacy. Future studies should focus on developing interventions that would target the bridge pathway and examine their effectiveness in reducing depression and increasing medication taking self-efficacy.",10.1007/s10461-024-04498-6,0,Scopus,85203439245,2-s2.0-85203439245,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203439245
Class imbalance-sensitive approach based on PLMs for the detection of cyberbullying in English and Arabic datasets,Benaissa A.R.,2025,Behaviour and Information Technology,"Social Networking increases allowed the spreading of cyberbullying worldwide. The latter invaded cyberspace, kids and adolescents are no more safe in their virtual playgrounds. Indeed, online bullying is attracting considerable concern due to the societal and health issues it causes, ranging from depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem to sui cide attempts. Automatic cyberbullying detection is becoming a vital factor in protecting individuals’ lives. It has received much attention in the last decade. Researchers use machine learning and deep learning models to detect online bullying content. An automatic cyberbullying detection model would flag any bullying text as efficiently as possible. Yet, several challenges lie ahead for the development of such a robust model. Our study discerned class imbalance and bullying text representation as being the major issues concerning cyberbullying classification. In this context, we tried to handle the class imbalance problem through data augmentation, cost-sensitive learning, and lever- aging a Computer Vision loss function for the task. Moreover, we consider a prominent solution for bullying content representation, which consists of fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models for cyberbullying detection and using these latter as feature extractors for Multichannel ConvNets and Bidirectional LSTMs. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed models, which outperform several past works and provide high Recall values (78%–96%) on English and Arabic datasets.",10.1080/0144929X.2024.2313142,2,Scopus,85184424423,2-s2.0-85184424423,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184424423

"Development of a Smart Health Care Service Using Metaverse and Chatbot Technologies for Adolescents, Parents, and School Health Teachers: User-Centered Design Approach",Kim H.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Adolescent health issues, particularly obesity, have become increasingly serious, highlighting the need for health management strategies tailored to the unique life cycle characteristics of adolescents. Objective: This study aimed to develop a smart health care service for adolescents, their parents, and school health teachers to enhance their health. Methods: The service leverages a mobile app, a web platform, wearable devices, the metaverse, and chatbots. The development process included a needs assessment, core user interface (UI) design, and service model creation. The needs assessment involved a literature review of 65 studies, a web survey of 96 participants, and 30 interviews. A usability evaluation of the core UI, shaped by the insights from the needs assessment, was conducted with 76 participants. Results: The service was conceptualized emphasizing school settings to cater to school-aged users, ensuring that the design is closely aligned with user needs. In addition, it incorporates features to deliver personalized services based on individual health information and uses gamification elements to enhance user engagement. The core UI was developed in response to the needs assessment findings, supported by a user flowchart. Furthermore, we created a use case diagram illustrating the interaction between various users and the services, a flowchart outlining the service algorithm, and a lifelog data collection system. The core UI usability evaluation results revealed that both students and parents considered sleep management important, while school health teachers deemed the measurement of physical activity essential. Students and parents prioritized physical activity measurement, and students particularly favored rewards for activities as the most promising solutions for health management challenges. The outcomes of the core UI usability evaluation indicated that school health teachers rated effectiveness (mean 4.26, SD 0.41), usefulness (mean 4.18, SD 0.54), usability (mean 4.29, SD 0.55), and user control (mean 4.08, SD 0.60) highly, reflecting the highest expectations across all categories. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a school-based smart health care service can effectively support adolescent health management by integrating personalized health data, gamification, and interactive tools. The usability evaluation revealed that students and parents prioritized sleep and physical activity tracking, while school health teachers emphasized the importance of monitoring physical activity. In addition, reward-based engagement strategies were identified as a promising approach to improve adolescent health behaviors. These findings suggest that leveraging digital health solutions tailored to adolescents’ needs can contribute to establishing sustainable health habits from an early age.",10.2196/69190,0,Scopus,105009609146,2-s2.0-105009609146,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009609146
Predicting the Need for Mental Treatment Across Various Age Groups Using Machine Learning Algorithm,Pal S.K.,2025,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"The extent of mental health is much more than what the general public knows. Many studies have found that women, the elderly, those who had recently survived a disaster, those who worked in the industrial sector, children, adolescents, and persons with long-term medical illnesses were at a higher risk of mental difficulties. Early recognition helps patients treat them more effectively and enhance their lives. Better living conditions, healthcare, and women's empowerment are all necessary. Mental health treatment is required for every age group, from children to seniors. This research will illuminate the need for mental health treatment across different age groups. This prediction is evaluated on the publicly available dataset. The dataset consists of 1259 entries and 27 attributes. Various accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques in identifying mental health concerns in this study. A comparison of these methods has been done and put into practice and also found that the Logistic Regression method, based on a forecast accuracy of 83.07%, was the most accurate. The machine learning algorithms used in this study include K-NN Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, AdaBoost and Random Forest, which are discussed with their algorithm procedure.",10.1007/978-981-97-8031-0_71,0,Scopus,85206842608,2-s2.0-85206842608,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206842608
Digital Therapeutics-Based Cardio-Oncology Rehabilitation for Lung Cancer Survivors: Randomized Controlled Trial,Li G.,2025,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Lung cancer ranks as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. For lung cancer survivors, cardiopulmonary fitness is a strong independent predictor of survival, while surgical interventions impact both cardiovascular and pulmonary function. Home-based cardiac telerehabilitation through wearable devices and mobile apps is a substitution for traditional, center-based rehabilitation with equal efficacy and a higher completion rate. However, it has not been widely used in clinical practice. Objective: The objective of this study was to broaden the use of digital health care in the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation of lung cancer survivors and to assess its impact on cardiopulmonary fitness and quality of life (QOL). Methods: Early-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer survivors aged 18-70 years were included. All the participants received surgery 1-2 months before enrollment and did not require further antitumor therapy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive cardiac telerehabilitation or usual care for 5 months. Artificial intelligence-driven exercise prescription with a video guide and real-time heart rate (HR) monitoring was generated based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Aerobic exercise combining elastic band-based resistance exercises were recommended with a frequency of 3-5 d/wk and a duration of 90-150 min/wk. The effective exercise duration was recorded when patients'HR reached the target zone (HRresting+ [HRmax - HRresting] × [≈40%-60%]), representing the duration under the target intensity. The prescription used a gradual progression in duration and action intensity based on the exercise data and feedback. Outcome measurements included cardiopulmonary fitness; lung function; cardiac function; tumor marker; safety; compliance; and scales assessing symptoms, psychology, sleep, fatigue, and QOL. Results: A total of 40 (85%) out of 47 patients finished the trial. The average prescription compliance rate of patients in the telerehabilitation group reached 101.2%, with an average exercise duration of 151.4 min/wk and an average effective exercise duration of 92.3 min/wk. The cardiac telerehabilitation was associated with higher improvement of maximal oxygen uptake peak (3.66, SD 3.23 mL/Kg/min vs 1.09, SD 3.23 mL/Kg/min; P=.02) and global health status or QOL (16.25, SD 23.02 vs 1.04, SD 13.90; P=.03) compared with usual care. Better alleviation of affective interference (-0.88, SD 1.50 vs 0.21, SD 1.22; P=.048), fatigue (-8.89, SD 15.96 vs 1.39, SD 12.09; P=.02), anxiety (-0.31, SD 0.44 vs -0.05, SD 0.29; P=.048), and daytime dysfunction (-0.55, SD 0.69 vs 0.00, SD 0.52; P=.02) was also observed in the telerehabilitation group. No exercise-related adverse events were identified during the intervention period. Conclusions: The 5-month, digital therapeutics-based telerehabilitation improved cardiorespiratory fitness in lung cancer survivors with good compliance and safety. Patients receiving telerehabilitation also reported improved QOL with reduced levels of fatigue, anxiety, and daytime dysfunction.",10.2196/60115,2,Scopus,86000000481,2-s2.0-86000000481,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000000481
Using the Healthy Native Youth Implementation Toolbox to Provide Web-Based Adolescent Health Promotion Decision Support to American Indian and Alaska Native Communities: Implementation Study,Sidhu A.,2025,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth experience numerous health inequities, including those in sexual, reproductive, and mental health. Implementation of culturally relevant, age-appropriate evidence-based programs may mitigate these inequities. However, numerous barriers limit the adoption and implementation of evidence-based adolescent health promotion programs in AI/AN communities. Objective: This study examines user reach and engagement from 2022 to 2024 of web-based decision support (the Healthy Native Youth [HNY] website and the embedded HNY Implementation Toolbox), designed to increase the implementation of evidence-based adolescent health promotion programming in AI/AN communities. Methods: Promotional strategies were designed for optimal geographic reach to Tribal organizations, opinion leaders, federal decision makers, and funders. Promotional channels included grassroots, community, and professional networks. We used Google Analytics to examine the uptake of the HNY website and HNY Implementation Toolbox from January 2022 to January 2024. The Toolbox provides culturally relevant tools and templates to help users navigate through 5 phases of program adoption and implementation: Gather, Choose, Prepare, Implement, and Grow. User reach was estimated by demographic characteristics and geographic location; user engagement was estimated by visit frequency and duration, bounce rates, and frequency of page and tool access. Results: Over the study period, page views of the HNY website and HNY Toolbox increased 10-fold and 27-fold, respectively. Over the 2-year evaluation period since the Toolbox “go live” date, approximately 1 in 8 users of the HNY website visited the Toolbox. The majority of HNY website users were located in Washington (n=1515), California (n=1290), and Oregon (n=1019) and were aged between 18 and 24 (n=1559, 21.7%) and 25‐34 (n=1676, 23.29%) years. Toolbox users were primarily located in California (n=1238), Washington (n=1142), and Oregon (n=986), mostly aged between 35 and 44 years (n=444, 35%). Both website and Toolbox users were primarily female, who accessed the site and Toolbox via desktop computers. The most frequently accessed phase pages within the Implementation Toolbox were Gather, Choose, Implement, and Prepare, as supported by bounce rates and average time on page. The most viewed phase was the “Gather” phase, with 3278 views. The most frequently downloaded tools within the Toolbox were Gather: Community Needs and Resource Assessment, with 136 downloads. The phases and tools accessed may have differed based on the user’s goal or stage of implementation. Conclusions: Findings indicate positive initial reach and engagement of the HNY website and HNY Implementation Toolbox among AI/AN educators that has consistently increased over the 2 years. The provision of web-based decision support that guides AI/AN users through the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of culturally relevant, age-appropriate, evidence-based adolescent health promotion programs in their communities may help increase the implementation of effective adolescent health promotion programs to ultimately increase health equity among AI/AN youth.",10.2196/67885,0,Scopus,105003079445,2-s2.0-105003079445,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105003079445
Predicting delayed antenatal care initiation among pregnant women in East Africa: using machine learning algorithms,Baykemagn N.D.,2025,Frontiers in Global Women S Health,"Background: Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate of maternal death due to pregnancy-related complications. The delayed onset of Antenatal care (ANC) is a major underlying factor for maternal mortality. The overall well-being and health of pregnant women and their fetuses greatly depend on the timely initiation of ANC care. This study aims to identify the top predictors of delayed antenatal care initiation in East Africa, including Ethiopia, to provide input for policymakers. Methodology: We employed secondary data from the Demographic Health Surveys conducted across ten East African countries between 2016 and 2023. After preprocessing the data, which included cleaning and feature selection through Recursive Feature Elimination, we addressed class imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). We then applied seven supervised learning algorithms to develop a robust machine learning model. The LGBM Classifier emerged as the top performer for predicting delayed antenatal care initiation, achieving accuracy of 75%, an AUC score of 81%, an F1 score of 78%, a recall of 79%, and a precision of 77%. Additionally, we employed association rule mining to further analyze. Result: Home delivery, low household income, a large number of household members, unemployment, being a younger woman, not using family planning methods, low educational level, and rural residence are predictors of delayed antenatal care initiation. Conclusion: The prevalence of late antenatal care (ANC) initiation is high (65%). Promote family planning utilization, targeted health literacy campaigns, youth-friendly programs, expand mobile clinics, and promote skilled birth attendance to increase timely ANC initiation are recommended.",10.3389/fgwh.2025.1488391,0,Scopus,105019254038,2-s2.0-105019254038,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105019254038
Machine Learning Algorithm-based Prediction Models for Adolescent Suicide Attempt,Jung J.,2025,Digest of Technical Papers IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics,"This paper presents a system aimed at preventing the serious social issue of adolescent suicide by identifying at-risk adolescents early and providing appropriate support. To achieve this, we propose machine learning models based on data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey (KYRBWS), targeting South Korean adolescents and considering various factors to predict suicide attempts. The models incorporate variables such as adolescents' behavioral patterns, emotional states, and family and social support systems. We applied Random Forest for feature selection to identify important features from the original dataset. The core algorithms include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. To ensure robust performance, we employed K-fold cross-validation. Additionally, to address the challenge of data imbalance, we applied various sampling techniques to develop reliable, high-performance models for predicting suicide attempts.

Predicting the Severity of Anxiety in Adolescents Through Passively Sensed Behaviors,Zhang E.,2025,Proceedings 2025 IEEE ACM International Conference on Connected Health Applications Systems and Engineering Technologies Chase 2025,"In this work, we investigate whether the severity of adolescents' anxiety can be predicted using passively sensed behaviors. We recruited 55 adolescent participants with diagnosed anxiety to participate in a 24-week-long study. Participants completed a weekly questionnaire recording their anxiety level. Using Fitbits and participants' mobile phones, we passively collected their physiology and behaviors. We find that adolescent anxiety can be predicted with a relatively low mean absolute error of 2.45 on a 22-point scale. Using SHAP values and feature importance, we determine that certain behaviors, particularly those related to phone usage, mobility, and activities, are particularly useful for predicting anxiety. Coincidentally, our study overlaps with the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we also explore how our participant's anxiety and behaviors varied throughout government-mandated lockdowns and during spikes of COVID cases after the lockdowns ended. We find evidence that participants were least anxious during partial lockdowns and when the cases of COVID-19 were low. We also find that participants' physiology and behaviors altered based on lockdown severity and prevalence of the disease. Despite these differences, the accuracy of our predictions remained consistent, regardless of lockdowns and the number of new COVID cases. These findings may provide insight into adolescents' anxiety and behaviors during prolonged traumatic events.",10.1145/3721201.3721389,0,Scopus,105016206568,2-s2.0-105016206568,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016206568
Through the Youth Eyes: Training Depression Detection Algorithms with Eye Tracking Data,Lagunes-Ramirez D.A.,2025,IEEE Latin America Transactions,"Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder, and early detection is crucial for effective intervention. Recent advancements in eye-tracking technology and machine learning offer new opportunities for non-invasive diagnosis. This study aims to assess the performance of different machine learning algorithms in. predicting depression in a young sample using eye-tracking metrics. Eye-tracking data from 139 participants were recorded with an emotional induction paradigm in which each participant observed a set of positive and negative emotional stimuli. The data were analyzed to find differences between groups, where the most significant features were selected to train prediction models. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling. Four algorithms support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and gradient boosting (GB) were trained with hyperparameter optimization and 5-fold cross-validation. The RF algorithm achieved the highest accuracy at 84%, followed by SVM, GB, and the MLP neural network. Performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, precision recall area under the curve (PR-AUC), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) were also used to evaluate the models. The findings suggest that eye-tracking metrics combined with machine learning algorithms can effectively identify depressive symptoms in the young, indicating their potential as non-invasive diagnostic tools in clinical settings.",10.1109/TLA.2025.10810399,0,Scopus,85219750159,2-s2.0-85219750159,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219750159
A Bibliometric Evaluation of the Link between Emotional Intelligence and Innovation,Prajeet G.,2025,Emotional Intelligence in the Digital Era Concepts Frameworks and Applications,"Despite the recovery from COVID-19 that resulted in relief to the employees, the sudden transition from offline to online working style has led to the rise of psychological imbalance. Because of the drastic change in the working style of the employees from offline to online, people were forced to be glued to digital screen for long hours, which has led to anxiety, stress, and depression. This enquiry used a bibliometric analysis of the last two decades, that is, 2002 to 2024, with the help of scouting the SCOPUS database in Emotional Intelligence and Innovation. The purpose of the study is to find the prominent authors and relevant countries which have published articles in this field. This study tried to address the stage of development of a foundational course for a counter stress burnout in one’s life. We found 283 articles which were selected for further examination. With the use of R studio and VOSviewer, we were able to make use of this software for data analysis. Few of the future themes that are emerging are adolescent, parent relation, emotion regulation, learning, skill, education, emotional intelligence, soft skills, sustainability, artificial intelligence, cognition, creativity, innovation, knowledge management, knowledge sharing, curriculum, empathy, leadership, innovativeness, and job performance. The probe found that emotional intelligence is an in-house behavior which has to be imbibed right from childhood and supported by parents.

Exploring the Characteristics of Online Counseling Chat Services for Youth in Europe: Web Search Study,Higuera-Lozano I.,2025,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Online counseling chat services are increasingly used by young people worldwide. A growing body of literature supports the use and effectiveness of these services for adolescent mental health. However, there is also a need to provide an overview of the main existing resources to identify unmet needs and gaps in the field. Objective: This study aims to provide an overview of existing online counseling chat services targeting individuals aged 12‐30 years in 4 European countries (Belgium, Finland, Hungary, and Spain), and to identify potential needs and gaps by comparing the collected data with recognized quality standard criteria that define the best practices in the field of counseling. Methods: A web search was conducted in the 4 participating countries using the same keywords to identify the main chat services. The final selection of chat services was made using a stratified purposive sampling method. A common data extraction database was developed to record information from these websites. Finally, the extracted information was compared against the fulfillment of 7 selected criteria from the Child Helpline International Quality Standards Framework. Additionally, certain chat characteristics were compared with the number of Child Helpline Quality Standard criteria fulfilled. Results: The search identified a total of 66 service providers offering 71 different chat services. Nongovernmental organizations accounted for more than half of the total service providers42 of 66 (64%). Additional helplines, such as hotlines, were also available through 54 of 66 (82%) service providers. Artificial intelligence tools were incorporated into 6 of 66 (9%) chat services. Differences were observed between countries; for example, the use of volunteers as counselors was predominant in Hungary and Belgium. Topic-specific chat services were common in Belgium and Spain, whereas in Finland and Hungary, chat services generally welcomed a wide range of topics for young people to discuss. Comparisons with Child Helpline International’s recommendations revealed some gaps—for example, only 9 of 71 (13%) chat services operated 24 hours a day, and only 10 of 71 (14%) offered interactions in minority groups or foreign languages. Additionally, the use of free social media platforms for chat services was prevalent in some countries, which could compromise users’ privacy. Being part of the Child Helpline International consortium was marginally associated with meeting a higher number of standard criteria (β coefficient 1.55; P=.08). Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive overview of existing online chat counseling services in 4 European countries. Our findings suggest that some existing chat services for young people could be improved in areas such as accessibility, data security, and the inclusion of vulnerable groups.",10.2196/67949,0,Scopus,105015388364,2-s2.0-105015388364,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105015388364

Explainability as an ethical requirement for digital phenotyping in adolescents,Schweiger G.,2025,Clinical Ethics,"This article examines how the concept of explainability must be fundamentally reconceptualised when applied to digital phenotyping in adolescent mental health contexts. After a short overview of digital phenotyping, the ethical challenges connected to it are sketched, which mostly come from the use of AI and include the well-known problems of bias, distortion, black box models and missing transparency. These aspects must be considered even more carefully when it comes to adolescents. After that, it is proposed that explainability should be the central ethical demand that must be fulfilled before such technologies are allowed to be used, and the connection between explainability and other important normative concepts like trust and informed consent is explained. While existing debates about AI transparency in healthcare often assume universal standards of explainability, this analysis demonstrates that the developmental, relational, and epistemic particularities of adolescence demand a qualitatively different understanding of what it means for algorithmic systems to be ‘explainable’. The paper argues that explainability in this context cannot be reduced to technical transparency or procedural information disclosure, but must be reimagined as a multidimensional, developmentally sensitive concept that encompasses relational dynamics, identity formation processes, and the cultivation of epistemic autonomy. This reconceptualisation reveals that traditional approaches to explainable AI – developed primarily for adult populations and clinical professionals – fail to address the specific ways in which adolescents engage with, understand, and are shaped by algorithmic categorisations of their mental states.",10.1177/14777509251372985,0,Scopus,105014874767,2-s2.0-105014874767,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105014874767
Identifying Cyberbullying Roles in Social Media,Sandoval M.,2025,Lecture Notes in Computer Science Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics,"Social media has revolutionized communication, allowing people worldwide to connect and interact instantly. However, it has also led to increases in cyberbullying, which poses a significant threat to children and adolescents globally, affecting their mental health and well-being. It is critical to accurately detect the roles of individuals involved in cyberbullying incidents to effectively address the issue on a large scale. This study explores the use of machine learning models to detect the roles involved in cyberbullying interactions. After examining the AMiCA dataset and addressing class imbalance issues, we evaluate the performance of various models built with four underlying LLMs (i.e. BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT-2) for role detection. Our analysis shows that oversampling techniques help improve model performance. The best model, a fine-tuned RoBERTa using oversampled data, achieved an overall F1 score of 83.5%, increasing to 89.3% after applying a prediction threshold. The top-2 F1 score without thresholding was 95.7%. Our method outperforms previously proposed models. After investigating the per-class model performance and confidence scores, we show that the models perform well in classes with more samples and less contextual confusion (e.g. Bystander Other), but struggle with classes with fewer samples (e.g. Bystander Assistant) and more contextual ambiguity (e.g. Harasser and Victim). This work highlights current strengths and limitations in the development of accurate models with limited data and complex scenarios.",10.1007/978-3-031-78548-1_26,0,Scopus,85218461682,2-s2.0-85218461682,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218461682
Menstrual Health Education Using a Specialized Large Language Model in India: Development and Evaluation Study of MenstLLaMA,Adhikary P.K.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The quality and accessibility of menstrual health education (MHE) in low- and middle-income countries, including India, remain inadequate due to persistent challenges (eg, poverty, social stigma, and gender inequality). While community-driven initiatives have sought to raise awareness, artificial intelligence offers a scalable and efficient solution for disseminating accurate information. However, existing general-purpose large language models (LLMs) are often ill-suited for this task, tending to exhibit low accuracy, cultural insensitivity, and overly complex responses. To address these limitations, we developed MenstLLaMA—a specialized LLM tailored to the Indian context and designed to deliver MHE empathetically, supportively, and accessibly. Objective: We aimed to develop and evaluate MenstLLaMA—a specialized LLM tailored to deliver accurate, culturally sensitive MHE—and assess its effectiveness in comparison to existing general-purpose models. Methods: We curated MENST—a novel, domain-specific dataset comprising 23,820 question-answer pairs aggregated from medical websites, government portals, and health education resources. This dataset was systematically annotated with metadata capturing age groups, regions, topics, and sociocultural contexts. MenstLLaMA was developed by fine-tuning Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, using parameter-efficient fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation to achieve domain alignment while minimizing computational overhead. We benchmarked MenstLLaMA against 9 state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Mistral. The evaluation followed a multilayered framework: (1) automatic evaluation using standard natural language processing metrics (BLEU [Bilingual Evaluation Understudy], METEOR [Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering], ROUGE-L [Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation-Longest Common Subsequence], and BERTScore [Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Score]); (2) evaluation by clinical experts (N=18), who rated 200 expert-curated queries for accuracy and appropriateness; (3) medical practitioner interaction through the ISHA (Intelligent System for Menstrual Health Assistance) interactive chatbot, assessing qualitative dimensions (eg, relevance, understandability, preciseness, correctness, and context sensitivity); and (4) a user study with volunteer participants (N=200), who evaluated MenstLLaMA in 15- to 20-minute randomized sessions, rating the system across 7 qualitative user satisfaction metrics. Results: MenstLLaMA achieved the highest scores in BLEU (0.059) and BERTScore (0.911), outperforming GPT-4o (BLEU: 0.052, BERTScore: 0.896) and Claude-3 (BERTScore: 0.888). Clinical experts preferred MenstLLaMA’s responses over gold-standard answers in several culturally sensitive cases. In medical practitioners’ evaluations using the ISHA—the chat interface powered by MenstLLaMA—the model scored 3.5 in relevance, 3.6 in understandability, 3.1/5 in preciseness, 3.5/5 in correctness, and 4.0/5 in context sensitivity. User evaluations indicated even stronger results, with ratings of 4.7/5 for understandability, 4.3/5 for relevance, 4.28/5 for preciseness, 4.1/5 for correctness, 4.6/5 for tone, 4.2/5 for flow, and 3.9/5 for context sensitivity. Conclusions: MenstLLaMA demonstrates exceptional accuracy, empathy, and user satisfaction within the domain of MHE, bridging critical gaps left by general-purpose LLMs. Its potential for integration into broader health education platforms positions it as a transformative tool for menstrual well-being. Future research could explore its long-term impact on public perception and menstrual hygiene practices, while expanding demographic representation, enhancing context sensitivity, and integrating multimodal and voice-based interactions to improve accessibility across diverse user groups.",10.2196/71977,0,Scopus,105010902850,2-s2.0-105010902850,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010902850
Detection of Violent Content in Videos Using Attention-Augmented 3-D Convolutional Networks,Sajja B.,2025,IEEE Multimedia,"Many videos over the Internet contain violent and explicit content. As the Internet becomes more accessible, these videos are now available to everyone. It is important to moderate such content as it can have detrimental effects on the mental well-being of people, especially children and teenagers. An automated system can prove useful for the efficient analysis of video content. Inspired by the success of multiheaded self-attention (MHSA) in 2-D CNNs, we propose a novel deep-learning architecture by extending MHSA to 3-D networks. We develop a framework that utilizes the Res3D network and attention-augmented 3-D convolution layers. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance; experiments on the Hockey Fights, the Movie Fights, and the Real Life Violence Situations datasets show accuracies of 98.3 ± 0.6%, 99 ± 1.2%, and 96.85 ± 0.66%.

Teenager Substance Use on Reddit: Mixed Methods Computational Analysis of Frames and Emotions,Zhang X.,2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Adolescent substance use disorder is a pressing public health issue, with increasing prevalence as individuals age. Social media platforms like Reddit (Reddit Inc) serve as significant venues for teenagers to discuss and navigate substance use. Social media platforms, such as Reddit, serve as increasingly important spaces where teenagers discuss, share, and navigate their experiences with substance use, presenting unique opportunities and challenges for understanding and addressing this issue. Objective: This study aims to explore how teenagers frame substance-use discussions on the r/teenagers subreddit, focusing on their personal interpretations, causal attributions, and the social and psychological contexts that shape these online support groups. By identifying these interpretive frames, we aimed to better understand the complex drivers of adolescent substance use behavior and their potential interventions. Methods: Using natural language processing techniques, we analyzed 32,674 substance use–related posts from 2018 to 2022. A framing approach was used to identify and categorize prevalent themes, supplemented by emotional profiling using the EmoLLaMA-chat-13B model developed by Liu and colleagues. Results: In total, 7 primary frames emerged: normalization, risk awareness, social integration, autonomy and rebellion, coping mechanisms, media influence, and stigmatization. These frames varied in prevalence and were associated with distinct emotional profiles, highlighting the complex interplay between substance use and adolescent experiences. We observed that, for example, the normalization frame was often associated with a mix of sadness and anxiety, while the coping frame exhibited elevated levels of anger, sadness, and anxiety. These distinctive emotional landscapes associated with each frame reveal unique insights into the mental state of adolescents navigating substance use. Conclusions: The findings underscore the multifaceted nature of adolescent substance-use discussions on social media. Interventions must address underlying emotional and social factors as well as identity to effectively mitigate substance use disorder among adolescents. By understanding the frames teenagers use to interpret substance use, we can pave the way for more effective and personalized public health campaigns, and support services designed to resonate with adolescents’ unique lived experiences.",10.2196/59338,1,Scopus,85218673076,2-s2.0-85218673076,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218673076
From promise to practice: insights into ChatGPT-4o use in child and adolescent mental health from professionals,Aral A.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Despite growing interest, empirical studies on ChatGPT-4o’s clinical role in child and adolescent mental health remain scarce. This study explored child and adolescent mental health professionals’ attitudes toward ChatGPT-4o, focusing on its clinical applications, ethical implications, and integration challenges. Methods: A sequential exploratory design was used, beginning with interviews to inform item generation. Finalized surveys were distributed online to 96 child and adolescent psychiatrists and 70 psychologists between April and May 2025. The instrument measured views across seven subscales and demonstrated strong internal consistency (α = 0.887 for child and adolescent psychiatrists; α = 0.903 for psychologists). Results: Overall, 47.9% of psychiatrists and 40% of psychologists reported prior use of ChatGPT-4o. Child and adolescent psychiatrists rated “Clinician-Facing Tool” and “Acting as a Therapist” most favorably, while psychologists expressed the most positive views toward “Bias” and “Profession”. Both groups viewed “Ethical Issues” least favorably. Comparative analyses revealed that psychiatrists scored significantly higher than psychologists on the profession (d = 0.46), psychoeducational use within treatment (d = 0.43), patient-facing tool (d = 0.68), digital access and personalization (d = 0.55), and crisis prevention and safety planning (d = 0.69). Psychiatrists also showed greater positive views toward self-help and behavior change interventions (U = 2649.5, Z = –2.41, p = 0.016, r = 0.19). In contrast, psychologists rated bias more favorably, representing the largest observed difference (d = 1.56). Development priorities differed slightly: child and adolescent psychiatrists emphasized software support for diagnostic & treatment, system oversight, and ethics, while psychologists also prioritized system oversight and ethics. Conclusion: Mental health professionals show cautious optimism toward ChatGPT-4o, with discipline-specific emphases. While a measured interest in ChatGPT-4o’s clinical integration, shared concerns around ethics highlight the need for role-specific guidelines and human oversight.",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1668814,0,Scopus,105018847519,2-s2.0-105018847519,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018847519
Interpretable Prediction Method of Adolescent Internet Addiction Based on DBO-XGBoost,Tong X.,2025,2025 8th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Icaibd 2025,"Adolescent Internet addiction is a global social problem in the Internet age, which seriously affects the physical and mental health of adolescents. Exploring its causes and accurately predicting addiction individuals is a current research hotspot. At present, most of the researches on predicting Internet addiction based on machine learning only consider a small number of addiction characteristics, and there are shortcomings in the accuracy and interpretability of the prediction results. Therefore, this paper proposes an interpretable prediction method for Internet addiction. Firstly, based on the psychological I-PACE framework, a multi-factor dataset of Internet addiction is constructed. Then, the XGBoost model is used to predict Internet addiction, and the parameters of the model are optimized by DBO to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Finally, SHAP model is used to explain the main causes of Internet addiction from two aspects of the global and individual, which improves the interpretability of the model. Experimental results show that the accuracy of DBO-XGBoost model prediction reaches 87.82%, and the AUC reaches 93.13%, and the interpretability of prediction results is enhanced by using SHAP method.",10.1109/ICAIBD64986.2025.11082029,0,Scopus,105012736687,2-s2.0-105012736687,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012736687
Smart Health Monitoring Approach to Diagnose Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorderbased on Real-Time Activity and Heart Rate Variability using Boosting Models,Kaur A.,2025,Recent Advances in Computer Science and Communications,"Introduction: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent chronic mental health condition that significantly impacts the psychological and physical well-being of millions of adolescents. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and mitigating the disorder's adverse effects. Despite extensive research efforts, current methods often fall short in simultaneously accounting for daily motor activity and heart rate variability in ADHD detection. Method: Addressing these gaps, this paper introduces a histogram-based gradient-boosting classifier for analyzing real-time activity and heart-rate variability data to automate ADHD diagnosis. By extracting twelve key features from the data and selecting the most significant ones with the extra tree model, we evaluate these features using various classifiers, including histogram-based gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting, and adaptive boosting. Results: The histogram-based gradient-boosting model, validated through ten-fold cross-validation, outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 99.12%, an F1 measure of 99.12%, and a sensitivity of 99.13%. Additionally, it achieves a specificity of 99.1%, an AUC of 0.9995, and a minimal FDR of 0.88%. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a highly effective and precise solution for automated ADHD diagnosis. Conclusion: The implications of these findings suggest that integrating real-time activity and heart-rate variability data into diagnostic processes can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ADHD assessment, potentially leading to earlier and more reliable diagnoses, improved patient outcomes, and more tailored treatment strategies.",10.2174/0126662558344316241022095150,0,Scopus,105002123452,2-s2.0-105002123452,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002123452
A virtual reality-based multimodal framework for adolescent depression screening using machine learning,Wu Y.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents poses an increasing global health concern, yet current screening practices rely heavily on subjective reports. Virtual reality (VR), integrated with multimodal physiological sensing (EEG+ET+HRV), offers a promising pathway for more objective diagnostics. Methods: In this case-control study, 51 adolescents diagnosed with first-episode MDD and 64 healthy controls participated in a 10-minute VR-based emotional task. Electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking (ET), and heart rate variability (HRV) data were collected in real-time. Key physiological differences were identified via statistical analysis, and a support vector machine (SVM) model was trained to classify MDD status based on selected features. Results: Adolescents with MDD showed significantly higher EEG theta/beta ratios, reduced saccade counts, longer fixation durations, and elevated HRV LF/HF ratios (all p <.05). The theta/beta and LF/HF ratios were both significantly associated with depression severity. The SVM model achieved 81.7% classification accuracy with an AUC of 0.921. Conclusions: The proposed VR-based multimodal system identified robust physiological biomarkers associated with adolescent MDD and demonstrated strong diagnostic performance. These findings support the utility of immersive, sensor-integrated platforms in early mental health screening and intervention. Future work may explore integrating the proposed multimodal system into wearable or mobile platforms for scalable, real-world mental health screening.",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1655554,0,Scopus,105017906581,2-s2.0-105017906581,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105017906581

Smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment and Wearable Activity Tracking in Pediatric Depression: Cohort Study,Saavedra J.U.,2025,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Adolescent depression is a significant public health concern. The presentation of depressive symptoms varies widely among individuals, fluctuating in intensity over time. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers a unique advantage by enhancing ecological validity and reducing recall bias, allowing for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms. This methodology provides valuable insights into the fluctuating nature of depression, which could inform more personalized and timely interventions. Objective: This study aims to (1) evaluate the feasibility of collecting smartphone-based EMA data alongside activity and sleep tracking in adolescents with depression; (2) investigate the severity and variability of mood symptoms reported over time; and (3) explore the relationship between mood, activity, and sleep. Methods: Thirty-six participants (23 with MDD, 13 unaffected controls; 75% [n=27] female, mean age 19.50 y) completed twice-daily EMA check-ins over 2 weeks, complemented by continuous activity and sleep monitoring using FitBit Charge 3 devices. The study examined feasibility, usability of the EMA app, symptom severity and variability, and relationships between mood, activity, and sleep. We applied linear mixed-effects regression to the data to examine relationships between variables. Results: Participants completed a total of 923 unique check-ins (mean check-ins per participant=25.60). Overall compliance rates were high (91.57%), indicating the approach is highly feasible. MDD participants demonstrated greater symptom severity and variability over time compared with controls (β=34.48, P<.001). Individuals with MDD exhibited greater diurnal variation (β=−2.54, P<.001) with worse mood in the morning and worse mood than anxiety scores over time (β=−6.93, P<.001). Life stress was a significant predictor of more severe EMA scores (β=24.50, P<.001). MDD cases exhibited more inconsistent sleep patterns (β=32.14, P<.001), shorter total sleep times (β=−94.38, P<.001), and a higher frequency of naps (β=14.05, P<.001). MDD cases took fewer steps per day (mean 5828.64, SD 6188.85) than controls (mean 7088.47, SD 5378.18) over the course of the study, but this difference was not significant (P=.33), and activity levels were not significantly predictive of EMA score (P=.75). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating smartphone-based EMA with wearable activity tracking in adolescents with depression. High compliance rates support the practicality of this approach, while EMA data provide valuable insights into the dynamic nature of depressive symptoms, particularly in relation to sleep and life stress. Future studies should validate these findings in larger, more diverse samples. Clinically, EMA and wearable tracking may enhance routine assessments and inform personalized interventions by capturing symptom variability and external influences in real time.",10.2196/66187,0,Scopus,105008035824,2-s2.0-105008035824,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008035824
Network analysis of core factors related to non-suicidal self-injury in adolescents with mood disorders,Zhang W.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: Adolescents with mood disorders are at an exceptionally high risk for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI); however, the understanding of the core factors underlying this vulnerability remains limited. This knowledge gap significantly hampers the effectiveness of targeted prevention and intervention strategies. Methods: A total of 263 adolescents with mood disorders completed a series of self-report surveys, covering demographic, personal, and social factors related to NSSI. We first used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify the core related factors. Then, we employed network analysis to construct the network structure of these core factors. Results: Our findings indicate that depressive and anxiety symptoms are the strongest influencing factors for NSSI among adolescents with mood disorders. Life events and the specific functions of NSSI are identified as personalized factors within this group. Additionally, objective social support and education level emerged as potential protective factors against NSSI. These factors are not independent but interact with each other. Conclusion: By identifying and intervening in these key factors, more effective prevention strategies and personalized treatment plans can be developed, ultimately improving the quality of life and psychological well-being of adolescents with mood disorders.",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1557351,1,Scopus,105005091019,2-s2.0-105005091019,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005091019
First-person pronouns as linguistic markers of depression among Brazilian youths,Viduani A.,2025,Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry,"Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability among youth, yet identifying this condition remains challenging. Naturalistic communication offers a promising approach to enhance depression detection. Increased use of first-person singular pronouns (e.g., ‘‘I’’) has been linked to MDD, but its applicability to younger, non-English-speaking populations remains unclear. Methods: This study examined first-person pronoun use in Brazilian Portuguese-speaking adolescents with and without MDD and its relationship to self-reported and clinician-rated depressive symptoms. Fifty-two adolescents (13 with and 39 without MDD) from the Identifying Depression Early in Adolescence Risk Stratified Cohort (IDEA-RiSCo) sample completed remote data collection using a WhatsApp chatbot, responding to questions via audio recordings. Transcripts were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Results: The MDD group used significantly more I-pronouns than non-MDD subjects (9.15 vs. 8.02%, t =-2.302, p = 0.026). Self-reported depressive symptomatology correlated with I-pronoun use (rho = 0.366, p = 0.008), but did not reach statistical significance for clinician-rated symptoms (rho = 0.248, p = 0.076). Conclusions: These findings support first-person singular pronouns as a potential linguistic marker of depression among Brazilian adolescents. This is the first study to replicate such results in a young, non-English-speaking sample using spoken speech, suggesting that integrating linguistic analysis with digital tools could enhance early detection efforts, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future research should explore use of I-pronouns alongside other linguistic and acoustic features to refine digital mental health screening approaches.",10.47626/1516-4446-2024-4058,0,Scopus,105008835865,2-s2.0-105008835865,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105008835865
HCBiLSTM-WOA: hybrid convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory with water optimization algorithm for autism spectrum disorder,Kavitha V.,2025,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a type of brain developmental disability that cannot be completely treated, but its impact can be reduced through early interventions. Early identification of neurological disorders will better assist in preserving the subjects’ physical and mental health. Although numerous research works exist for detecting autism spectrum disorder, they are cumbersome and insufficient for dealing with real-time datasets. Therefore, to address these issues, this paper proposes an ASD detection mechanism using a novel Hybrid Convolutional Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Water Optimization Algorithm (HCBiLSTM-WOA). The prediction efficiency of the proposed HCBiLSTM-WOA method is investigated using real-time ASD datasets containing both ASD and non-ASD data from toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults. The inconsistent and incomplete representations of the raw ASD dataset are modified using preprocessing procedures such as handling missing values, predicting outliers, data discretization, and data reduction. The preprocessed data obtained is then fed into the proposed HCBiLSTM-WOA classification model to effectively predict the non-ASD and ASD classes. The initially randomly initialized hyperparameters of the HCBiLSTM model are adjusted and tuned using the water optimization algorithm (WOA) to increase the prediction accuracy of ASD. After detecting non-ASD and ASD classes, the HCBiLSTM-WOA method further classifies the ASD cases into respective stages based on the autistic traits observed in toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults. Also, the ethical considerations that should be taken into account when campaign ASD risk communication are complex due to the data privacy and unpredictability surrounding ASD risk factors. The fusion of sophisticated deep learning techniques with an optimization algorithm presents a promising framework for ASD diagnosis. This innovative approach shows potential in effectively managing intricate ASD data, enhancing diagnostic precision, and improving result interpretation. Consequently, it offers clinicians a tool for early and precise detection, allowing for timely intervention in ASD cases. Moreover, the performance of the proposed HCBiLSTM-WOA method is evaluated using various performance indicators such as accuracy, kappa statistics, sensitivity, specificity, log loss, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC). The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed HCBiLSTM-WOA method in detecting ASD compared to other existing methods. The proposed method achieves a higher ASD prediction accuracy of about 98.53% than the other methods being compared.",10.1080/10255842.2024.2399016,3,Scopus,85204215861,2-s2.0-85204215861,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204215861
Statistically Examining the Effect of Herbal and Spiritual Environment on Various Dimensions of Adolescents’ Fitness Post-COVID Effects,Rastogi R.,2025,Yoga and Meditation Past and Present Evidence,"In the past few years, humanity has faced many challenges due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. But even in such difficulties, the world can’t stop growing, so we humans have adopted various lifestyle changes like working from home, online education, etc., in order to get our jobs done. However, these changes have affected us physically and mentally in many ways, and the major impact of these changes is seen on adolescents (age group of 10 to 18 years), resulting in them being diagnosed with many physical and mental health ailments like obesity, lack of mobility, stress, mental trauma, etc., due to less exposure to the outside environment and a sudden increase in social media. All these aspects are hindering the overall growth needed in that particular age group. Therefore, this study is based on the impact of some techniques based on Indian Vedic Science to rejuvenate the physical and mental health of adolescents or to counter the post-COVID effects. These techniques basically include the consumption of an herbal Vedic formulation named Saraswati Panchak and protocols of yoga and Yajna to be followed for a period of 3 months. Two groups, namely the control group (not following the Vedic protocol) and the experimental group (following the Vedic protocol), are assessed for various aspects like IQ, courage, mathematical ability, etc., on various scales, and a comparative study is conducted followed by data analysis using various tools like Python and Tableau. Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the well-being of adolescents, affecting not only their physical health but also their mental and emotional states. By examining the effect of herbal and spiritual environments on their fitness, we hope to shed light on how we can support and empower young people to heal and thrive during these challenging times. This research is not just about presenting data, it’s about giving hope and creating a brighter future for the next generation. Scope of the Study: Adolescence is the bridge between innocent childhood and ambitious chaotic adulthood, and the sudden changes in our bodies physically and mentally as part of growing up often leave teenagers in a very confusing situation with a messy mind. The anxiety and curiosity due to hormonal and physical changes are compounded by social insecurities. Surveys report an increase in rates of psychological disorders, suicides, and addictions among teenagers. The effect of the psychic distress caused as an additional effect of COVID-19, due to social isolation and grief from deaths and the challenges of being confined to a house, directly impacted the developing neuroanatomy. Alterations in the frontal limbic system of the brains of children suffering from PTSD were also reported in a few cases. In such a scenario, this research study offers hope for the future. The attempt to use a scientific approach to prove the efficacy of Yajna and herbs as remedies for the traumas of adolescence, and as a way to ensure emotional, physical, mental, and social stability among teenagers, provides an opportunity to explore ancient wisdom through the lens of modern technologies. The research paves the way for the integration of ancient science and modern innovation to create a better world. It also emphasizes the need to use science not only as a way to make life easier, but also as a light to cure the darkness of this world. Topic Organizations: The chapter sheds light on the post-COVID lifestyle and how it affected the particular age group of teenagers, the mental confusion they had to suffer from. The team later illuminates the impact of Indian Vedic science and its different aspects, including Yajna as a solution to all the problems of adolescence. It further explains the role of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and modern technologies in the social scientific studies like the one represented by this chapter. This is succeeded by the briefing of already established literary work. The methodologies are further explained along with a flow chart. In the results sections, individual graphs of all the subjects are demonstrated to show the outcome of the experiment conducted. The conclusion from this was obtained reporting the astounding effect of Yajna and Saraswat Panchak on the subjects. Ethical Committee and Funding: The experiments don’t include any human-related experiments, so no ethical constraints have been violated. Though the subjects performing the study were humans and air quality directly affects them, the study doesn’t violate any health-related measures. The project is not funded by any agency. Role of Authors: Dr. Rohit Rastogi acted as the team leader and coordinated among all co-authors. He prepared the topic introduction and background study, and also contributed to experiments.

"Advances in diagnosis, management, and long-term outcomes of pediatric vasovagal syncope: a comprehensive review",Zhu W.,2025,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most common cause of transient loss of consciousness in children and adolescents, accounting for 60%–80% of syncope cases. This review synthesizes current evidence on pediatric VVS, focusing on advances in diagnosis, management, and long-term outcomes. Through a comprehensive literature search of studies published between 2001 and 2024, we analyzed epidemiological patterns, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, management strategies, and prognostic factors. Recent diagnostic advances include implantable loop recorders and smartphone applications, which have improved diagnostic accuracy. Management has evolved toward individualized approaches, emphasizing non-pharmacological interventions (hydration, salt supplementation, physical counterpressure maneuvers) as first-line treatment, with medications such as midodrine and fludrocortisone showing variable efficacy in refractory cases. Long-term studies indicate that while most children experience improvement over time, 33%–50% have recurrent episodes within three years, with factors such as lower mean arterial pressure, higher urine specific gravity, younger age, family history of syncope, and lower body mass index associated with increased recurrence risk. Though generally benign, VVS can significantly impact quality of life and carries substantial psychosocial consequences. Future research should focus on developing predictive models for recurrence risk and exploring personalized treatment approaches to improve outcomes.",10.3389/fcvm.2025.1481749,1,Scopus,105004464836,2-s2.0-105004464836,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004464836
The burden of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and incidence rate forecast in China from 1990 to 2021,Li N.,2025,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Objective: To analyze the temporal trends and future projections of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) burden among children and adolescents in China from 1990 to 2021, and to identify age-, period-, and cohort-specific drivers of disease progression. Methods: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, we conducted joinpoint regression to detect trend transitions in ADHD incidence and age-standardized rates. Age-period-cohort (APC) modeling was applied to disentangle the effects of age, calendar period, and birth cohort on disease burden. Projections up to 2046 were generated using demographic forecasts from the GBD 2017 population database. Results: Crude ADHD prevalence declined by 21.17% (2168.055 to 1723.307 per 100,000), yet age-standardized prevalence increased by 9.86% (AAPC=0.272%, 95%CI:0.173–0.372, P<0.001). Similarly, age-standardized DALY rates rose by 10.15% (AAPC=0.262%, 95%CI:0.160–0.364,P<0.001), with females showing faster growth than males (AAPC for DALY: 0.294% vs. 0.229%,P<0.001). Adolescents aged 10–14 years bore the highest burden, with prevalence (5,727.28/100,000) and DALY rates (70.55/100,000) twice the global average. APC projections indicated a peak incidence in 2029 for this age group, linked to cohort effects from China’s “Double Reduction” education policy and rising digital exposure. Conclusion: China faces a rising ADHD burden driven by sociodemographic transitions and diagnostic advancements. Targeted interventions—particularly for adolescents and females—are urgently needed. Strengthening school-based screening, integrating AI-driven diagnostic tools, and prioritizing mental health in national policies could mitigate long-term impacts. These findings underscore the necessity of dynamic surveillance systems to address ADHD’s evolving epidemiology in transitioning societies.",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1532156,3,Scopus,105000394274,2-s2.0-105000394274,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000394274
HEALING THROUGH EMPATHY: MACHINE LEARNING FOR ADAPTIVE THERAPY FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN ARMED CONFLICT,Shah J.M.,2024,Sociological Studies of Children and Youth,"This chapter introduces EmoGenPath, an innovative machine learning-based model designed to deliver adaptive therapy to children and youth affected by the trauma of armed conflict. The model synthesizes advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including convolutional neural networks for emotion recognition and an advantage-actor critic-trained reinforcement learning model for therapeutic content tailoring toward goal achievement, to provide a dynamic and personalized therapeutic experience. Recognizing the importance of empathetic and culturally sensitive interventions, EmoGenPath offers a unique approach by prioritizing the emotional states and individual narratives of its users. In regions where conflict has impeded traditional mental health services, this model aims to bridge the gap, facilitating resilience and recovery through a virtual therapeutic environment that can be accessed via low-bandwidth internet connections, ensuring broader reach and impact. This chapter emphasizes the ethical implementation of AI in sensitive settings.

Additionally, it outlines the potential of such a model to scale therapeutic resources effectively, delivering tailored interventions with a compassionate approach.",10.1108/S1537-466120240000035014,0,Scopus,85212850507,2-s2.0-85212850507,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212850507
"CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN ARMED CONFLICT: RESPONSES, RESISTANCE, AND PORTRAYAL IN MEDIA",Shah T.M.,2024,Sociological Studies of Children and Youth,"This volume explores the intersection of youth agency, media representation, and conflict, urging a reevaluation of the roles of youth in contemporary socio-political contexts. Media serves as a tool for and a site of resistance. Chapters in this volume highlight ways in which children and youth leverage digital platforms to reshape narratives around conflict and peace. The compilation draws from a wide range of contexts, from the Balkan Wars to the current conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, offering in-depth analyses of the transformative potential of the (re)imagining of youth experiences, thus shifting from passive subjects to active narrators. This reorientation emphasizes the role of new technologies, including digital media and artificial intelligence, in supporting these endeavors, especially in enhancing mental health and psychological resilience among children affected by conflict.",10.1108/S1537-466120240000035001,2,Scopus,85212832014,2-s2.0-85212832014,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212832014
Introduction to the section on cyberbullying and digital cruelty,Englander E.,2024,Handbook of Children and Screens Digital Media Development and Well Being from Birth Through Adolescence,"This section presents four chapters reviewing the current state of research on cyberbullying, digital cruelty, and online hate speech, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and their association with mental health. Researchers in this field face challenges, including the different forms that cyberbullying and hate speech can take, the definition of cyberbullying, and how future technologies like Artificial Intelligence may change the research landscape. Two chapters in this section discuss digital forms of social cruelty, including cyberbullying, and how these currently manifest on social media and (likely) impact mental health. Other chapters examine the impact of the global pandemic on cyberbullying and how online bias has infiltrated and influenced cyberbullying and its serious impact on users. Among other points, these chapters discuss online hate speech and how youth may be differentially vulnerable (e.g., LGBTQ youth). This Introduction briefly discusses how the definition of cyberbullying may change and how new technologies may alter how digital cruelty is experienced by youth.",10.1007/978-3-031-69362-5_58,0,Scopus,105000363461,2-s2.0-105000363461,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000363461
Moving beyond fear and restriction to promoting adolescent resilience and intentional technology use,Wisniewski P.,2024,Handbook of Children and Screens Digital Media Development and Well Being from Birth Through Adolescence,"In recent years, societal narratives around teens and screens have shifted significantly. First, high-profile media coverage has raised concerns over the negative impact of technology use on the mental health, well-being, and physical safety of adolescents. Consequently, this has led to restrictive approaches to implementing parental control software, age verification systems, artificial intelligence-based risk detection, and other safety mechanisms to protect teens from such harm. At the same time, recommendations regarding digital technology use have moved beyond imposing time limits to more advanced frameworks that consider active and intentional technology use. Additionally, research recommends shifting from restrictive parenting practices to include more developmentally appropriate and resilience-based approaches that empower teens as they prepare for adulthood. Yet, researchers have acknowledged that solutions towards digital inclusion cannot be ""one-size-fits-all,"" as individual development, family differences, and cultural norms may influence youth outcomes. Finally, we have seen more tangible efforts through human-centered design and legislative policies targeted toward making digital platforms that engage teen users more accountable for their online safety. In this chapter, we discuss these trends and raise important questions and recommendations for setting a forward-thinking agenda for future socio-technical research and practice on promoting the digital well-being and safety of teens.",10.1007/978-3-031-69362-5_55,4,Scopus,105000265320,2-s2.0-105000265320,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000265320
Evaluating Bias-Mitigated Predictive Models of Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders,Wong E.F.,2024,JAMA Network Open,"Importance: Machine learning for augmented screening of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) requires thorough consideration of clinical biases embedded in electronic health records (EHRs) and rigorous evaluations of model performance. Objective: To mitigate bias in predictive models of PMADs trained on commonly available EHRs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study collected data as part of a quality improvement initiative from 2020 to 2023 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. The study inclusion criteria were birthing patients aged 14 to 59 years with live birth records and admission to the postpartum unit or the maternal-fetal care unit after delivery. Exposure: Patient-reported race and ethnicity (7 levels) obtained through EHRs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Logistic regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting models were trained to predict 2 binary outcomes: moderate to high-risk (positive) screen assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Each model was fitted with or without reweighing data during preprocessing and evaluated through repeated K-fold cross validation. In every iteration, each model was evaluated on its area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and on 2 fairness metrics: demographic parity (DP), and difference in false negatives between races and ethnicities (relative to non-Hispanic White patients). Results: Among 19430 patients in this study, 1402 (7%) identified as African American or Black, 2371 (12%) as Asian American and Pacific Islander; 1842 (10%) as Hispanic White, 10942 (56.3%) as non-Hispanic White, 606 (3%) as multiple races, 2146 (11%) as other (not further specified), and 121 (<1%) did not provide this information. The mean (SD) age was 34.1 (4.9) years, and all patients identified as female. Racial and ethnic minority patients were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic White patients to screen positive on both the PHQ-9 (odds ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.23-1.77]) and the EPDS (odds ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.20-1.57]). Mean AUROCs ranged from 0.610 to 0.635 without reweighing (baseline), and from 0.602 to 0.622 with reweighing. Baseline models predicted significantly greater prevalence of postpartum depression for patients who were not non-Hispanic White relative to those who were (mean DP, 0.238 [95% CI, 0.231-0.244]; P <.001) and displayed significantly lower false-negative rates (mean difference, -0.184 [95% CI, -0.195 to -0.174]; P <.001). Reweighing significantly reduced differences in DP (mean DP with reweighing, 0.022 [95% CI, 0.017-0.026]; P <.001) and false-negative rates (mean difference with reweighing, 0.018 [95% CI, 0.008-0.028]; P <.001) between racial and ethnic groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic study of predictive models of postpartum depression, clinical prediction models trained to predict psychometric screening results from commonly available EHRs achieved modest performance and were less likely to widen existing health disparities in PMAD diagnosis and potentially treatment. These findings suggest that is critical for researchers and physicians to consider their model design (eg, desired target and predictor variables) and evaluate model bias to minimize health disparities.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.38152,9,Scopus,85211414382,2-s2.0-85211414382,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211414382
"An artificial intelligence tool to assess the risk of severe mental distress among college students in terms of demographics, eating habits, lifestyles, and sport habits: an externally validated study using machine learning",Zhang L.,2024,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Precisely estimating the probability of mental health challenges among college students is pivotal for facilitating timely intervention and preventative measures. However, to date, no specific artificial intelligence (AI) models have been reported to effectively forecast severe mental distress. This study aimed to develop and validate an advanced AI tool for predicting the likelihood of severe mental distress in college students. Methods: A total of 2088 college students from five universities were enrolled in this study. Participants were randomly divided into a training group (80%) and a validation group (20%). Various machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were employed and trained in this study. Model performance was evaluated using 11 metrics, and the highest scoring model was selected. In addition, external validation was conducted on 751 participants from three universities. The AI tool was then deployed as a web-based AI application. Results: Among the models developed, the eXGBM model achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.932 (95% CI: 0.911–0.949), closely followed by RF with an AUC of 0.927 (95% CI: 0.905–0.943). The eXGBM model demonstrated superior performance in accuracy (0.850), precision (0.824), recall (0.890), specificity (0.810), F1 score (0.856), Brier score (0.103), log loss (0.326), and discrimination slope (0.598). The eXGBM model also received the highest score of 60 based on the evaluation scoring system, while RF achieved a score of 49. The scores of LR, DT, and SVM were only 19, 32, and 36, respectively.

A nomogram for predicting the risk of temporomandibular disorders in university students,Cui Y.,2024,BMC Oral Health,"Objectives: Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) have a relatively high prevalence among university students. This study aimed to identify independent risk factors for TMD in university students and develop an effective risk prediction model. Methods: This study included 1,122 university students from four universities in Changchun City, Jilin Province, as subjects. Predictive factors were screened by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the machine learning Boruta algorithm in the training cohort. A multifactorial logistic regression analysis was used to construct a TMD risk prediction model. Internal validation of the model was conducted via bootstrap resampling, and an external validation cohort comprised 205 university students undergoing oral examinations at the Stomatological Hospital of Jilin University. Results: The prevalence of TMD among university students was 44.30%. Ten predictive factors were included in the model, comprising gender, facial cold stimulation, unilateral chewing, biting hard or resilient foods, clenching teeth, grinding teeth, excessive mouth opening, malocclusion, stress, and anxiety. The model demonstrated good predictive ability with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.853, 0.838, and 0.821 in the training cohort, internal validation cohort, and external validation cohort, respectively. The calibration curves demonstrated that the predicted results were consistent with the actual results, and the decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated the model's high clinical utility. Conclusions: An online nomogram of TMD in university students with good predictive performance was constructed, which can effectively predict the risk of TMD in university students. The model provides a useful tool for the early identification and treatment of TMDs in university students, helping clinicians to predict the probability of TMDs in each patient, thus providing more personalized and accurate treatment decisions for patients.",10.1186/s12903-024-04832-3,5,Scopus,85203259264,2-s2.0-85203259264,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203259264
Predictive analysis of college students’ academic procrastination behavior based on a decision tree model,Song P.,2024,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,"Predicting academic procrastination among college students in the context of a public crisis could provide essential academic support and decision-making strategies for higher education institutions to promote student psychological health. Notably, research focusing on predicting academic procrastination behavior among college students in the context of a global crisis is still limited. The purpose of this study is to address this gap by constructing a predictive model based on the decision tree algorithm to predict academic procrastination behavior among college students. A total of 776 college students from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China participated in this study. The study gathered data from multiple aspects relevant to academic procrastination behavior, including demographic information, academic achievements, subjective well-being, smartphone addiction, negative emotions, self-esteem, life autonomy, pro-environmental behavior, academic achievement, and sense of school belonging. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted utilizing SPSS version 26.0, and decision tree model analysis was performed with Modeler 18.0. The findings of this study identified eight predictive factors of college students’ academic procrastination in order of importance: subjective well-being, smartphone addiction, negative emotions, self-esteem, life autonomy, pro-environmental behavior, academic performance, and sense of school belonging. The model accuracy was 85.78%, and indicating a relatively high level of prediction. The findings of this study not only provided a new perspective for understanding academic procrastination but also offered practical guidance for educators on how to mitigate this behavior.",10.1057/s41599-024-03300-1,7,Scopus,85197439919,2-s2.0-85197439919,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197439919
A machine learning-based classification model to support university students with dyslexia with personalized tools and strategies,Zingoni A.,2024,Scientific Reports,"Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder that causes issues related to reading, which affects around 10% of the worldwide population. This can compromise comprehension and memorization skills, and result in anxiety and lack of self-esteem, if no support is provided. Moreover, this support should be highly personalized, to be actually helpful. In this paper, a model to classify the most useful methodologies to support students with dyslexia has been created, with a focus on university alumni. The prediction algorithm is based on supervised machine learning techniques; starting from the issues that dyslexic students experience during their career, it is capable of suggesting customized support digital tools and learning strategies for each of them. The algorithm was trained and tested on data acquired through a self-evaluation questionnaire, which was designed and then spread to more than 1200 university students. It allowed 17 useful tools and 22 useful strategies to be detected. The results of the testing showed an average prediction accuracy higher than 90%, which rises to 94% by renouncing to guess the less-predictable 8 tools/strategies. In the light of this, it is possible to state that the implemented algorithm can achieve the set goal and, thus, reduce the gap between dyslexic and non-dyslexic students. This achievement paves the way for a new modality of facing the problem of dyslexia by university institutions, which aims at modifying teaching activities toward students’ needs, instead of simply reducing their study load or duties. This complies with the definition and the aims of inclusivity.",10.1038/s41598-023-50879-7,28,Scopus,85181257735,2-s2.0-85181257735,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181257735
Robust remote detection of depressive tendency based on keystroke dynamics and behavioural characteristics,Fadul R.,2024,Scientific Reports,"Depressive Disorder (DD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Screening tools for detecting DD symptoms are essential for monitoring and efficient managing. Remarkably, individuals’ kinetic activities, including their interaction with touchscreen smartphones, can be a proxy for their mental status. Therefore, studying these typing patterns can assist in developing passive screening tools for detecting even the early stage of DD, i.e., the depressive tendency (DT). Here we extend a previous study by exploring different machine learning models with various feature engineering approaches to detect the subjects’ DT, as indicated by the self-administered Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score, via keystroke digital biomarkers. The keystroke timing sequences were unobtrusively collected from 24 subjects during routine interaction with touchscreen smartphones, resulting in 23,264 typing sessions. The proposed framework was investigated under two keystroke feature combinations—hold-time and flight-time variables—and validated using nested cross-validation scheme. Different feature selection (FS) techniques were employed to select informative features from the keystroke sequences. The best-performing gradient boosting classifier with features selected by the mutual information FS method achieved an improved Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.98 [95% confidence interval: 0.91-1.00]. The proposed DT pipeline, which surpasses the state-of-the-art models, could effectively capture DT, considering users’ behavioural characteristics. This would potentially provide users with information regarding the evolution of their mental health, simultaneously contributing to improving digital tools for objectively screening mental disorders in-the-wild.",10.1038/s41598-024-78489-x,4,Scopus,85209111451,2-s2.0-85209111451,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209111451
Artificial intelligence as a virtual coach in a cognitive behavioural intervention for perfectionism in young people: A randomised feasibility trial,Johnson C.,2024,Internet Interventions,"Background: We examined the feasibility and outcomes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a virtual coach in guided self-help (GSH-AI) compared to pure self-help (PSH). Method: Participants (N = 85 undergraduate university students; M age = 20.65 years [SD = 2.38]; 84 % female) were randomised to PSH (N = 42) or GSH-AI (N = 43). The intervention was a brief 11-module online cognitive behaviour therapy for perfectionism intervention completed over 4-weeks. GSH-AI participants were given suggested questions to ask AI for guidance in completing the intervention. Data were collected at baseline, 4- and 8-weeks post-randomisation. Results: Engagement was good, only one person in each group did not use any modules; module completion was equivalent across conditions (6.67, SD = 3.22 and 6.18, SD = 3.42 respectively). Between baseline and post-intervention people in the GSH-AI condition showed an almost 3.5 times increase in preferring support to be received from AI versus other modes of support. Only 52 % and 22 % of participants completed 4- and 8-week post-randomisation surveys, with no differences in psychological outcomes between the PSH and GSH-AI groups. Main effects of time indicated moderate to large within-group effect size improvements for disordered eating, stress, anxiety, and perfectionism. Conclusions: Qualitative feedback indicated that AI was initially acceptable as a guide and became even more acceptable after it had been experienced. Fully powered trials are required to determine the impact of AI guidance on outcomes, and whether type of AI platform (customised versus generic) and type of mental health disorder interact with its effects.",10.1016/j.invent.2024.100795,3,Scopus,85210728996,2-s2.0-85210728996,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210728996
Health issues of young adults with hearing loss or deafness: A basis for the development of a chatbot,Meng M.,2024,Zeitschrift Fur Evidenz Fortbildung Und Qualitat Im Gesundheitswesen,"Background: The loss of hearing and thus communication affects the well-being of millions of people worldwide. Digital tools for coping with everyday life are becoming increasingly important and can have a positive impact on health literacy, especially among young adults. This raises the question of which issues such apps should specifically address in order to meet the needs of young adults with hearing loss or deafness. Methods: The aim was to identify the health issues of young adults (aged 18–28 years) with hearing loss or deafness in order to derive specific recommendations for a conversational agent (chatbot). A multiple embedded case study design consisting of chat interviews (n = 8) and an online-based expert survey (n = 14) was used. Results: The central phenomenon focuses on “The sense of belonging and feeling well in spite of hearing loss”, which is influenced by two main categories: a. the ability to be oneself despite one's vulnerability; b. the desire to be strong despite one's vulnerability. Important health issues include depression, drug use, diet, exercise, isolation due to COVID measures and HIV prophylaxis. Conclusion: Written information must be provided in simple and accessible language supported by images and symbols. Conversation agents developed to support people with hearing impairment should be easy to install and self-explanatory to use.",10.1016/j.zefq.2024.09.002,0,Scopus,85208069460,2-s2.0-85208069460,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208069460
Gender differences in preferences for mental health apps in the general population – a choice-based conjoint analysis from Germany,Jagemann I.,2024,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Men and women differ in the mental health issues they typically face. This study aims to describe gender differences in preferences for mental health treatment options and specifically tries to identify participants who prefer AI-based therapy over traditional face-to-face therapy. Method: A nationally representative sample of 2,108 participants (53% female) aged 18 to 74 years completed a choice-based conjoint analysis (CBCA). Within the CBCA, participants evaluated twenty choice sets, each describing three treatment variants in terms of provider, content, costs, and waiting time. Results: Costs (relative importance [RI] = 55%) emerged as the most critical factor when choosing between treatment options, followed by provider (RI = 31%), content (RI = 10%), and waiting time (RI = 4%). Small yet statistically significant differences were observed between women and men. Women placed greater importance on the provider, while men placed greater importance on cost and waiting time. Age and previous experience with psychotherapy and with mental health apps were systematically related to individual preferences but did not alter gender effects. Only a minority (approximately 8%) of participants preferred AI-based treatment to traditional therapy. Conclusions: Overall, affordable mental health treatments performed by human therapists are consistently favored by both men and women. AI-driven mental health apps should align with user preferences to address psychologist shortages. However, it is uncertain whether they alone can meet the rising demand, highlighting the need for alternative solutions.",10.1186/s12888-024-06134-y,1,Scopus,85206280090,2-s2.0-85206280090,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206280090
Predicting suicidal ideation from irregular and incomplete time series of questionnaires in a smartphone-based suicide prevention platform: a pilot study,Quellec G.,2024,Scientific Reports,"Over 700,000 people die by suicide annually. Collecting longitudinal fine-grained data about at-risk individuals, as they occur in the real world, can enhance our understanding of the temporal dynamics of suicide risk, leading to better identification of those in need of immediate intervention. Self-assessment questionnaires were collected over time from 89 at-risk individuals using the EMMA smartphone application. An artificial intelligence (AI) model was trained to assess current level of suicidal ideation (SI), an early indicator of the suicide risk, and to predict its progression in the following days. A key challenge was the unevenly spaced and incomplete nature of the time series data. To address this, the AI was built on a missing value imputation algorithm. The AI successfully distinguished high SI levels from low SI levels both on the current day (AUC = 0.804, F1 = 0.625, MCC = 0.459) and three days in advance (AUC = 0.769, F1 = 0.576, MCC = 0.386). Besides past SI levels, the most significant questions were related to psychological pain, well-being, agitation, emotional tension, and protective factors such as contacts with relatives and leisure activities. This represents a promising step towards early AI-based suicide risk prediction using a smartphone application.",10.1038/s41598-024-71760-1,0,Scopus,85203301244,2-s2.0-85203301244,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203301244
Personal values clusters and their associations to social media behaviors and psychological well-being,Ionescu C.G.,2024,BMC Psychology,"The current study contributes to the literature by assessing the associations between personal values, explored with Schwartz`s Portrait Values Questionnaire, social media behaviors, assessed with Bergen Scale of Social Media Addiction and Social Media Motivations to Use Scale and psychological well-being assessed with Patient Health Questionnaire-4, in a sample of first-year medical students. It was examined medical students’ personal values profiles and the perceived influence of social media on self-aspects. All participants (N = 151) were Romanian and English module students, young (average age = 19.2, SD = 1.5), 68,9% females and 31,1% males. Pearson coefficient correlation analyses were performed to verify the associations between the main four clusters of personal values (Self Transcendence, Self Enhancement, Openness to change and Conservationism) with social media behaviors and psychological wellbeing. The most frequent cluster of values was Self-Transcendence (M = 5.21) while the least was Self-Enhancement (M = 4.05). There was no significant correlation between social media addiction, psychological wellbeing and a specific cluster of values while the perception of self-aspects influenced by social media included involvement in community problems, creativity for Openness to change group (R =.24;.22, p <.05), tolerance towards sexual minorities and self-evaluation in Self Transcendence group (R =.24;.21;.42, p <.05) while Conservationism and Self Enhancement groups didn`t report any change.

Depression in the COVID-19 endemic era: Analysis of online self-disclosures by young South Koreans,Kim S.,2024,Plos One,"Although COVID-19 has been declared endemic in South Korea, there are economic and psychosocial after-effects. One of these is the prevalence of depression. Depressed adolescents and young adults struggle with insecurity, loneliness, and lack of confidence due to the life limitations imposed during the pandemic. Young South Koreans experienced deterioration in mental health because of the recurrence of mass infections. To address professionals’ concerns about the lingering effects of COVID-19 on youth mental health, we text-mined young South Koreans’ online posts about depression during the pandemic and the endemic phases—from February 2020 to May 2023. We used a total of 1,740 selected posts (raw data publicly available on https://github.com/kimalexis1129/PLOS_endemic_depression.git) to explore the situational triggers, additional factors, and by-products of depression that have persisted during the endemic era. We used Latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet-multinomial regression topic modeling methods in conjunction with sentiment analysis and mean comparison. The results showed that the pandemic and endemic topic models shared similarities, but emerging topics showed extended adversities such as adolescents’ vulnerability to eating disorders and young adults’ tendency to self-isolate. Comparisons between the levels of positive and negative affect during the pandemic and endemic eras revealed no significant changes in mood. We discussed the results in comparison with SARS and MERS precedents and from general and cultural perspectives.",10.1371/journal.pone.0314881,1,Scopus,85213231505,2-s2.0-85213231505,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213231505
Detection of suicidality from medical text using privacy-preserving large language models,Wiest I.C.,2024,British Journal of Psychiatry,"Background Attempts to use artificial intelligence (AI) in psychiatric disorders show moderate success, highlighting the potential of incorporating information from clinical assessments to improve the models. This study focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to detect suicide risk from medical text in psychiatric care. Aims To extract information about suicidality status from the admission notes in electronic health records (EHRs) using privacy-sensitive, locally hosted LLMs, specifically evaluating the efficacy of Llama-2 models. Method We compared the performance of several variants of the open source LLM Llama-2 in extracting suicidality status from 100 psychiatric reports against a ground truth defined by human experts, assessing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score across different prompting strategies. Results A German fine-tuned Llama-2 model showed the highest accuracy (87.5%), sensitivity (83.0%) and specificity (91.8%) in identifying suicidality, with significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity across various prompt designs. Conclusions The study demonstrates the capability of LLMs, particularly Llama-2, in accurately extracting information on suicidality from psychiatric records while preserving data privacy.

Can heart rate sequences from wearable devices predict day-long mental states in higher education students: a signal processing and machine learning case study at a UK university,Chen T.,2024,Brain Informatics,"The mental health of students in higher education has been a growing concern, with increasing evidence pointing to heightened risks of developing mental health condition. This research aims to explore whether day-long heart rate sequences, collected continuously through Apple Watch in an open environment without restrictions on daily routines, can effectively indicate mental states, particularly stress for university students. While heart rate (HR) is commonly used to monitor physical activity or responses to isolated stimuli in a controlled setting, such as stress-inducing tests, this study addresses the gap by analyzing heart rate fluctuations throughout a day, examining their potential to gauge overall stress levels in a more comprehensive and real-world context. The data for this research was collected at a public university in the UK. Using signal processing, both original heart rate sequences and their representations, via Fourier transformation and wavelet analysis, have been modeled using advanced machine learning algorithms. Having achieving statistically significant results over the baseline, this provides a understanding of how heart rate sequences alone may be used to characterize mental states through signal processing and machine learning, with the system poised for further testing as the ongoing data collection continues.",10.1186/s40708-024-00243-w,0,Scopus,85210983536,2-s2.0-85210983536,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210983536
Online dating: predictors of problematic tinder use,Vera Cruz G.,2024,BMC Psychology,"Background: Geolocation apps have radically transformed dating practices around the world, with profound sociocultural implications. Few studies, however, have explored their addictive potential or factors that are associated with their misuse. Objective: The present study aimed to assess the level of problematic Tinder use (PTU) in an adult sample, using a machine learning algorithm to determine, among 29 relevant variables, the most important predictors of PTU. Methods: 1,387 users of Tinder (18–74 years-old; male = 50.3%; female = 49.1%) completed an online questionnaire, and a machine learning tool was used to analyze their responses. Results: On 5-point scale, participants’ mean PTU score was 1.91 (SD = 0.70), indicating a relatively low overall level of problematic app use. Among the most important predictors of Problematic use were the use of Tinder for enhancement (reduce boredom and increase positive emotions), coping with psychological problems, and increasing social connectedness. The number of “matches” (when two users show mutual interest), the number of online contacts on Tinder, and the number of resulting offline dates were also among the top predictors of PTU. Depressive mood and loneliness were among the middle-ranked predictors of PTU. Conclusion: In accordance with the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model of problematic internet use, the results suggest that PTU relates to how individual experience on the app interacts with dispositional and situational characteristics. However, variables that seemed to relate to PTU, including lack of self-esteem, negative mood states and loneliness, are not problems that online dating services as currently designed can be expected to resolve. This argues for increased digital services to identify and address potential problems helping drive the popularity of dating apps.",10.1186/s40359-024-01566-3,6,Scopus,85186378477,2-s2.0-85186378477,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186378477
GPT-4 shows potential for identifying social anxiety from clinical interview data,Ohse J.,2024,Scientific Reports,"While the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)—particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) models—for detecting symptoms of depression from text has been vastly researched, only a few studies examine such potential for the detection of social anxiety symptoms. We investigated the ability of the large language model (LLM) GPT-4 to correctly infer social anxiety symptom strength from transcripts obtained from semi-structured interviews. N = 51 adult participants were recruited from a convenience sample of the German population. Participants filled in a self-report questionnaire on social anxiety symptoms (SPIN) prior to being interviewed on a secure online teleconference platform. Transcripts from these interviews were then evaluated by GPT-4. GPT-4 predictions were highly correlated (r = 0.79) with scores obtained on the social anxiety self-report measure.

Facing depression: evaluating the efficacy of the EmpkinS-EKSpression reappraisal training augmented with facial expressions – protocol of a randomized controlled trial,Keinert M.,2024,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Dysfunctional depressogenic cognitions are considered a key factor in the etiology and maintenance of depression. In cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the current gold-standard psychotherapeutic treatment for depression, cognitive restructuring techniques are employed to address dysfunctional cognitions. However, high drop-out and non-response rates suggest a need to boost the efficacy of CBT for depression. This might be achieved by enhancing the role of emotional and kinesthetic (i.e., body movement perception) features of interventions. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive restructuring task augmented with the performance of anti-depressive facial expressions in individuals with and without depression. Further, we aim to investigate to what extent kinesthetic markers are intrinsically associated with and, hence, allow for the detection of, depression. Methods: In a four-arm, parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will randomize 128 individuals with depression and 128 matched controls without depression to one of four study conditions: (1) a cognitive reappraisal training (CR); (2) CR enhanced with instructions to display anti-depressive facial expressions (CR + AFE); (3) facial muscle training focusing on anti-depressive facial expressions (AFE); and (4) a sham control condition. One week after diagnostic assessment, a single intervention of 90–120-minute duration will be administered, with a subsequent follow-up two weeks later. Depressed mood will serve as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include current positive mood, symptoms of depression, current suicidality, dysfunctional attitudes, automatic thoughts, emotional state, kinesthesia (i.e., facial expression, facial muscle activity, body posture), psychophysiological measures (e.g., heart rate (variability), respiration rate (variability), verbal acoustics), as well as feasibility measures (i.e., treatment integrity, compliance, usability, acceptability). Outcomes will be analyzed with multiple methods, such as hierarchical and conventional linear models and machine learning. Discussion: If shown to be feasible and effective, the inclusion of kinesthesia into both psychotherapeutic diagnostics and interventions may be a pivotal step towards the more prompt, efficient, and targeted treatment of individuals with depression. Trial registration: The study was preregistered in the Open Science Framework on August 12, 2022 (https://osf.io/mswfg/) and retrospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register on November 25, 2024.

Real world analysis of treatment change and response in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) alone and with concomitant psychiatric comorbidities: results from an electronic health record database study is the United States,Liman C.,2024,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: The objectives of this study were to examine the association of psychiatric comorbidities and patient characteristics with treatment change and response as well as to assess the association between treatment change and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) among adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychiatric comorbidities. Methods: De-identified electronic health records from the NeuroBlu Database (2002–2021) were used to select patients ≥ 18 years with ADHD who were prescribed ADHD-specific medication. The index date was set as the first prescription of ADHD medication. The outcomes were treatment change (discontinuation, switch, add-on, or drop) and HCRU (inpatient, outpatient, composite) within 12 months of follow-up. Cox proportional-hazard model was used to assess the association between clinical and demographic patient characteristics and treatment change, while generalized linear model with negative binomial distribution and log link function was used to assess the association between key risk factors linked to treatment change and HCRU rates. Results: A total of 3,387 patients with ADHD were included (ADHD only: 1,261; ADHD + major depressive disorder (MDD): 755; ADHD + anxiety disorder: 467; ADHD + mood disorder: 164). Nearly half (44.8%) of the study cohort experienced a treatment change within the 12-month follow-up period. Treatment switch and add-on were more common in patients with ADHD and comorbid MDD and anxiety disorder (switch: 18.9%; add-on: 20.5%) compared to other cohorts (range for switch: 8.5–13.6%; range for add-on: 8.9–12.1%) Survival analysis demonstrated that the probability of treatment change within 12 months from treatment initiation in the study cohort was estimated to be 42.4%. Outpatient visit rates statistically significantly increased from baseline (mean [SD] 1.03 [1.84] visits/month) to 3 months post-index (mean [SD] 1.62 [1.91] visits/month; p < 0.001), followed by a gradual decline up to 12 months post-index. Being prescribed both a stimulant and a non-stimulant at index date was statistically significantly associated with increased risk of treatment change (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.13, 2.38; p = 0.01). Conclusions: This real-world study found that treatment change was common among patients with ADHD and psychiatric comorbidities.

"Classification of mindfulness experiences from gamma-band effective connectivity: Application of machine-learning algorithms on resting, breathing, and body scan",Hsu A.L.,2024,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,"Background and Objective: Practicing mindfulness is a mental process toward interoceptive awareness, achieving stress reduction and emotion regulation through brain-function alteration. Literature has shown that electroencephalography (EEG)-derived connectivity possesses the potential to differentiate brain functions between mindfulness naïve and mindfulness experienced, where such quantitative differentiation could benefit telediagnosis for mental health. However, there is no prior guidance in model selection targeting on the mindfulness-experience prediction. Here we hypothesized that the EEG effective connectivity could reach a good prediction performance in mindfulness experiences with brain interpretability. Methods: We aimed at probing direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF) to classify the participants’ history of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and aimed at optimizing the prediction accuracy by comparing multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms. Targeting the gamma-band effective connectivity, we evaluated the EEG-based prediction of the mindfulness experiences across 7 machine learning (ML) algorithms and 3 sessions (i.e., resting, focus-breathing, and body-scan). Results: The support vector machine and naïve Bayes classifiers exhibited significant accuracies above the chance level across all three sessions, and the decision tree algorithm reached the highest prediction accuracy of 91.7 % with the resting state, compared to the classification accuracies with the other two mindful states. We further conducted the analysis on essential EEG channels to preserve the classification accuracy, revealing that preserving just four channels (F7, F8, T7, and P7) out of 19 yielded the accuracy of 83.3 %. Delving into the contribution of connectivity features, specific connectivity features predominantly located in the frontal lobe contributed more to classifier construction, which aligned well with the existing mindfulness literature. Conclusion: In the present study, we initiated a milestone of developing an EEG-based classifier to detect a person's mindfulness experience objectively. The prediction accuracy of the decision tree was optimal to differentiate the mindfulness experiences using the local resting-state EEG data. The suggested algorithm and key channels on the mindfulness-experience prediction may provide guidance for predicting mindfulness experiences using the EEG-based classification embedded in future wearable neurofeedback systems or plausible digital therapeutics.",10.1016/j.cmpb.2024.108446,1,Scopus,85205458844,2-s2.0-85205458844,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205458844
"Exploring online public survey lifestyle datasets with statistical analysis, machine learning and semantic ontology",Chatterjee A.,2024,Scientific Reports,"Lifestyle diseases significantly contribute to the global health burden, with lifestyle factors playing a crucial role in the development of depression. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified many determinants of depression. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and demographic factors associated with depression symptoms among Indians during the pandemic, focusing on a sample from Kolkata, India. An online public survey was conducted, gathering data from 1,834 participants (with 1,767 retained post-cleaning) over three months via social media and email. The survey consisted of 44 questions and was distributed anonymously to ensure privacy. Data were analyzed using statistical methods and machine learning, with principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) employed for feature selection. K-means clustering divided the pre-processed dataset into five clusters, and a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel achieved 96% accuracy in a multi-class classification problem. The Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm provided local explanations for the SVM model predictions. Additionally, an OWL (web ontology language) ontology facilitated the semantic representation and reasoning of the survey data. The study highlighted a pipeline for collecting, analyzing, and representing data from online public surveys during the pandemic. The identified factors were correlated with depressive symptoms, illustrating the significant influence of lifestyle and demographic variables on mental health. The online survey method proved advantageous for data collection, visualization, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining anonymity and reducing bias. Challenges included reaching the target population, addressing language barriers, ensuring digital literacy, and mitigating dishonest responses and sampling errors. In conclusion, lifestyle and demographic factors significantly impact depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study’s methodology offers valuable insights into addressing mental health challenges through scalable online surveys, aiding in the understanding and mitigation of depression risk factors.",10.1038/s41598-024-74539-6,0,Scopus,85206551069,2-s2.0-85206551069,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206551069
Neural and behavioral markers of inhibitory control predict symptom improvement during internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for depression,Thai M.,2024,Translational Psychiatry,"Poor inhibitory control contributes to deficits in emotion regulation, which are often targeted by treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Brain regions that contribute to inhibitory control and emotion regulation overlap; thus, inhibitory control might relate to response to CBT. In this study, we examined whether baseline inhibitory control and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) within overlapping emotion regulation-inhibitory control regions predicted treatment response to internet-based CBT (iCBT). Participants with MDD were randomly assigned to iCBT (N = 30) or a monitored attention control (MAC) condition (N = 30). Elastic net regression was used to predict post-treatment Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores from baseline variables, including demographic variables, PHQ-9 scores, Flanker effects (interference, sequential dependency, post-error slowing), and rsFC between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral anterior insula (AI), and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Essential prognostic predictor variables retained in the elastic net regression included treatment group, gender, Flanker interference response time (RT), right AI-TPJ rsFC, and left AI-right AI rsFC. Prescriptive predictor variables retained included interactions between treatment group and baseline PHQ-9 scores, age, gender, Flanker RT, sequential dependency effects on accuracy, post-error accuracy, right AI-TPJ rsFC, and left AI-right AI rsFC. Inhibitory control and rsFC within inhibitory control-emotion regulation regions predicted reduced symptom severity following iCBT, and these effects were stronger in the iCBT group than in the MAC group. These findings contribute to a growing literature indicating that stronger inhibitory control at baseline predicts better outcomes to psychotherapy, including iCBT.",10.1038/s41398-024-03020-9,4,Scopus,85199400723,2-s2.0-85199400723,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199400723
Predicting anxiety using Google and Youtube digital traces,Rochotte J.,2024,Emerging Trends in Drugs Addictions and Health,"Anxiety is a widespread and serious mental health issue that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and other stressors. In this study, we explore how online behavior data from Google and YouTube can be used to infer anxiety levels in individuals. We collected and processed digital traces from nearly 100 participants over eight weeks and applied various machine learning techniques to extract features and build predictive models. We found that combining data from multiple media modalities can yield highly accurate predictive models for anxiety as self-reported by a clinical GAD-7 scale (AUC > 0.86). We also found that the semantic categories of online engagement can affect the predictive performance of the models. This study contributes to the field of computational social science and digital mental health and demonstrates the potential of using online behavior data to monitor psychological well-being and design interventions for anxiety.",10.1016/j.etdah.2024.100145,0,Scopus,85188540681,2-s2.0-85188540681,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188540681
Prediction of Suicidal Thoughts and Suicide Attempts in People Who Gamble Based on Biological-Psychological-Social Variables: A Machine Learning Study,Mohajeri M.,2024,Psychiatric Quarterly,"Recent research has shown that people who gamble are more likely to have suicidal thoughts and attempts compared to the general population. Despite the advancements made, no study to date has predicted suicide risk factors in people who gamble using machine learning algorithms. Therefore, current study aimed to identify the most critical predictors of suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts among people who gamble using a machine learning approach. An online survey conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 741 people who gamble (mean age: 25.9 ± 5.56). To predict the risk of suicide attempts and ideation, we employed a comprehensive set of 40 biological, psychological, social, and socio-demographic variables. The predictive models were developed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), robust eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and ensemble machine learning algorithms. Data analysis was performed using R-Studio software. Random Forest emerged as the top-performing algorithm for predicting suicidal ideation, with an impressive AUC of 0.934, sensitivity of 0.7514, specificity of 0.9885, PPV of 0.9473, and NPV of 0.9347. Across all models, dissociation, depression, and anxiety symptoms consistently emerged as crucial predictors of suicidal ideation. However, for suicide attempt prediction, all models exhibited weaker performance. XGBoost showed the best performance in this regard, with an AUC of 0.663, sensitivity of 0.78, specificity of 0.8990, PPV of 0.34, NPV of 0.984, and accuracy of 0.8918. Depressive symptoms and rumination severity were highlighted as the most important predictors of suicide attempts according to this model. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and public health interventions. Machine learning could help detect individuals prone to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among people who gamble, assisting in creating tailored prevention programs to address future suicide risks more effectively.",10.1007/s11126-024-10101-x,8,Scopus,85207791634,2-s2.0-85207791634,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207791634
Accurately predicting mood episodes in mood disorder patients using wearable sleep and circadian rhythm features,Lim D.,2024,Npj Digital Medicine,"Wearable devices enable passive collection of sleep, heart rate, and step-count data, offering potential for mood episode prediction in mood disorder patients. However, current models often require various data types, limiting real-world application. Here, we develop models that predict future episodes using only sleep-wake data, easily gathered through smartphones and wearables when trained on an individual’s sleep-wake history and past mood episodes. Using mathematical modeling to longitudinal data from 168 patients (587 days average clinical follow-up, 267 days wearable data), we derived 36 sleep and circadian rhythm features. These features enabled accurate next-day predictions for depressive, manic, and hypomanic episodes (AUCs: 0.80, 0.98, 0.95). Notably, daily circadian phase shifts were the most significant predictors: delays linked to depressive episodes, advances to manic episodes. This prospective observational cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03088657, 2017-3-23) shows sleep-wake data, combined with prior mood episode history, can effectively predict mood episodes, enhancing mood disorder management.",10.1038/s41746-024-01333-z,13,Scopus,85209542517,2-s2.0-85209542517,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209542517
How do medical professionals make sense (or not) of AI? A social-media-based computational grounded theory study and an online survey,Weber S.,2024,Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal,"To investigate opinions and attitudes of medical professionals towards adopting AI-enabled healthcare technologies in their daily business, we used a mixed-methods approach. Study 1 employed a qualitative computational grounded theory approach analyzing 181 Reddit threads in the several subreddits of r/medicine. By utilizing an unsupervised machine learning clustering method, we identified three key themes: (1) consequences of AI, (2) physician–AI relationship, and (3) a proposed way forward. In particular Reddit posts related to the first two themes indicated that the medical professionals' fear of being replaced by AI and skepticism toward AI played a major role in the argumentations. Moreover, the results suggest that this fear is driven by little or moderate knowledge about AI. Posts related to the third theme focused on factual discussions about how AI and medicine have to be designed to become broadly adopted in health care. Study 2 quantitatively examined the relationship between the fear of AI, knowledge about AI, and medical professionals' intention to use AI-enabled technologies in more detail. Results based on a sample of 223 medical professionals who participated in the online survey revealed that the intention to use AI technologies increases with increasing knowledge about AI and that this effect is moderated by the fear of being replaced by AI.",10.1016/j.csbj.2024.02.009,19,Scopus,85186128175,2-s2.0-85186128175,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186128175
"Association Between Impulsivity, Self-Harm, Suicidal Ideation, and Suicide Attempts in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury",Ladner L.,2024,Journal of Neurotrauma,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects over 48 million people worldwide each year. Suicide is common in TBI, and there are several known contributing factors, including severe TBI, depression, alcohol use, and male sex. Impulsivity, or the tendency to act quickly with little thought, may be an early predictor of suicidality following TBI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of suicidality in patients with a prior history of impulsivity following a TBI. Using de-identified electronic health records from the TriNetX U.S. Collaborative Network with Natural Language Processing, three cohorts were generated: the impulsivity TBI cohort (I+TBI+) included subjects with a diagnosis of impulsivity before a diagnosis of TBI; the no impulsivity TBI cohort (I−TBI+) included patients with TBI but no impulsivity; the impulsivity no TBI cohort (I+TBI−) included patients with impulsivity but TBI. Two analyses were conducted, including analysis 1 (impulsivity TBI vs. no impulsivity TBI) and analysis 2 (impulsivity TBI vs. impulsivity no TBI). Patients were 1:1 matched by age, sex, race, ethnicity, psychiatric diagnoses, and antidepressant use. Outcomes included a diagnosis of self-harm, suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt within 1 year after the index event. The all-time incidence of each outcome was assessed across different age categories. The chi-square test (categorical variables) and t-test (numerical variables) were used to assess for differences between groups. A total of 1,292,776 patients with TBI were identified in the study. After 1:1 matching, there were 20,694 patients (mean [standard deviation, SD] age, 48.1 [21.8]; 8,424 females [40.7%]) with impulsivity and TBI (I+TBI+), 1,272,082 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.0 [23.1]; 562,705 females [44.2%]) with TBI alone (I−TBI+), and 90,669 patients (mean [SD] age, 43.7 [22.6]; 45,188 females [49.8%]) with impulsivity alone (I+TBI−). Within the first year after a TBI, patients with impulsivity were more likely to exhibit self-harm (p < 0.001), suicidal ideation (p < 0.001), or a suicide attempt (p < 0.001). Compared with patients with TBI without impulsivity, those with impulsivity had a 4-fold increase in the incidence of self-harm (2.81% vs. 0.63%), an 8-fold increase in suicidal ideation (52.42% vs. 6.41%), and a 21-fold increase in suicide attempts (32.02% vs. 1.50%). This study suggests that impulsivity diagnosed before a TBI may increase the risk of post-traumatic suicidality, with a 4-fold increased risk of self-harm, an 8-fold increased risk of suicidal ideation and a 21-fold increased risk of suicide attempts. This characterizes a group of at-risk individuals who may benefit from early psychiatric support and targeted interventions following a TBI.",10.1089/neu.2024.0167,0,Scopus,85203650313,2-s2.0-85203650313,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203650313
"Reducing Exposures to Endocrine Disruptors (REED) study, a personalized at-home intervention program to reduce exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals among a child-bearing age cohort: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",Rochester J.R.,2024,Trials,"Background : Exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to chronic diseases including breast cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and infertility. Exposure during pregnancy may have a lifelong impact on the fetus. Services are needed to allow individuals to learn about their personal EDC exposures and how to reduce them. Million Marker (MM) aims to crowdsource and scale the biomonitoring of environmental chemicals and provide actionable results to empower individuals to proactively assess, track, and reduce their EDC exposures. In previous research, we developed and tested the first mobile EDC intervention service (mail-in urine testing and exposure report-back) for its efficacy in increasing EH literacy (EHL), willingness to reduce exposures (i.e., readiness to change, RtC), and system usability. After intervention, we found increased EHL, increased RtC in women (but not men), and decreased EDC exposure. However, some participants did not increase their RtC and had difficulty carrying out the intervention on their own. The reasons for these less optimal results were the difficulty in the EHL subject matter—participants still felt ill-prepared to apply their knowledge to making healthier lifestyle changes. Therefore, in this study, we will address these perceived limitations. Methods: We will test a self-directed online interactive curriculum with live counseling sessions and individualized support modeled after the highly effective Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Recruiting from the Healthy Nevada Project (HNP), one of the largest population health cohorts in the world, we test the effectiveness of our EDC-specific online intervention curriculum via EHL and RtC surveys and determine changes in EDC exposure before and after intervention in a randomized controlled trial. We will also test for common clinical biomarkers via a commercially available at-home test (Siphox). We will recruit and randomize 300 women and 300 men of reproductive age (total n=600) from HNP. Our target population is men and women of reproductive age (18–44 years old). Discussion: At the conclusion of this project, we will be well-positioned to scale our services to clinics and the general public, with the eventual aims of FDA approval, insurance coverage, and incorporation into routine clinical care.",10.1186/s13063-024-08627-3,1,Scopus,85210075561,2-s2.0-85210075561,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210075561
"The prevalence, course, and risk factors of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among students in vocational education",Looijmans M.,2024,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,"Background: Worldwide, suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents and young adults. Given that suicide in this age group is common within vocational students, this study aims to provide insights into the prevalence, course, and risk factors of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) among students in vocational education over the past 10 years. Methods: This study has a repeated cross-sectional design, utilizing data from 2013 to 2023 provided by the ‘Testjeleefstijl’ foundation in the Netherlands (‘Test Your Lifestyle’). In total, 101,182 students in vocational education completed a web-based standardized questionnaire. Univariate logistic regression was used to test the predictive value of risk factors separately (anxiety and depression, gender, age and school year) on SI and SA. In addition, a machine learning model (Berkelmans et al., 2023) ​was used for high-risk identification of combined risk factors (multivariate models). Results: Within vocational students, 12-month SI and SA prevalence increased from respectively 17.7% and 2.3% in schoolyear 2013–2014 to 23% and 3.2% in 2022–2023. Although female gender significantly predicted SI and SA in the univariate analyses, the multivariate models revealed that female gender decreased the likelihood of both SI (OR 0.9) and SA (OR 0.7). A high risk for anxiety and depression was the strongest predictor in the multivariate models for SI (OR 42.8) and SA (OR 19.0). Conclusion: Over the past decade, the prevalence of SI and SA increased in students in vocational education, with the risk of anxiety and depression being the strongest contributing factor. While females had a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression, the results suggest these conditions tend to lead to SI and SA more quickly among male students. Early intervention in suicide prevention is crucial, highlighting the need to identify and address anxiety and depression. Vocational education schools have a critical role in this, emphasizing early screening and intervention, with specific attention to gender-specific factors.",10.1186/s13034-024-00828-7,3,Scopus,85206814012,2-s2.0-85206814012,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206814012

Towards accurate screening and prevention for PTSD (2-ASAP): protocol of a longitudinal prospective cohort study,Karchoud J.F.,2024,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Effective preventive interventions for PTSD rely on early identification of individuals at risk for developing PTSD. To establish early post-trauma who are at risk, there is a need for accurate prognostic risk screening instruments for PTSD that can be widely implemented in recently trauma-exposed adults. Achieving such accuracy and generalizability requires external validation of machine learning classification models. The current 2-ASAP cohort study will perform external validation on both full and minimal feature sets of supervised machine learning classification models assessing individual risk to follow an adverse PTSD symptom trajectory over the course of 1 year. We will derive these models from the TraumaTIPS cohort, separately for men and women. Method: The 2-ASAP longitudinal cohort will include N = 863 adults (N = 436 females, N = 427 males) who were recently exposed to acute civilian trauma. We will include civilian victims of accidents, crime and calamities at Victim Support Netherlands; and who were presented for medical evaluation of (suspected) traumatic injuries by emergency transportation to the emergency department. The baseline assessment within 2 months post-trauma will include self-report questionnaires on demographic, medical and traumatic event characteristics; potential risk and protective factors for PTSD; PTSD symptom severity and other adverse outcomes; and current best-practice PTSD screening instruments. Participants will be followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-trauma, assessing PTSD symptom severity and other adverse outcomes via self-report questionnaires. Discussion: The ultimate goal of our study is to improve accurate screening and prevention for PTSD in recently trauma-exposed civilians. To enable future large-scale implementation, we will use self-report data to inform the prognostic models; and we will derive a minimal feature set of the classification models. This can be transformed into a short online screening instrument that is user-friendly for recently trauma-exposed adults to fill in. The eventual short online screening instrument will classify early post-trauma which adults are at risk for developing PTSD. Those at risk can be targeted and may subsequently benefit from preventive interventions, aiming to reduce PTSD and relatedly improve psychological, functional and economic outcomes.",10.1186/s12888-024-06110-6,2,Scopus,85206507878,2-s2.0-85206507878,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206507878
Investigating the mechanisms of internet gaming disorder and developing intelligent monitoring models using artificial intelligence technologies: protocol of a prospective cohort,Huang Y.,2024,BMC Public Health,"Background: Internet gaming disorder (IGD), recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), significantly impacts adolescent mental and physical health. With a global prevalence of 3.05%, rates are higher in Asia, especially among adolescents and males. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated IGD due to increased gaming time from isolation and anxiety. Vulnerable groups include adolescents with poor academic performance, introverted personalities, and comorbid mental disorders. IGD mechanisms remain unclear, lacking prospective research. Based on Skinner’s reinforcement theory, the purpose of this study is to explore the mechanisms of IGD from individual and environmental perspectives, incorporating age-related changes and game features, and to develop intelligent monitoring models for early intervention in high-risk adolescents. Methods: This prospective cohort study will investigate IGD mechanisms in middle and high school students in Shenzhen, China. Data will be collected via online surveys and Python-based web scraping, with a 3-year follow-up and assessments every 6 months. Unstructured data obtained through Python-based web scraping will be structured using natural language processing techniques. Collected data will include personal characteristics, gaming usage, academic experiences, and psycho-behavioral-social factors. Baseline data will train and test predictive models, while follow-up data will validate them. Data preprocessing, normalization, and analysis will be performed. Predictive models, including Cox proportional hazards and Weibull regression, will be evaluated through cross-validation, confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), and root mean square error (RMSE). Discussion: The study aims to understand the interplay between individual and environmental factors in IGD, incorporating age-related changes and game features. Active monitoring and early intervention are critical for preventing IGD. Despite limitations in geographic scope and biological data collection, the study’s innovative design and methodologies offer valuable contributions to public health, promoting effective interventions for high-risk individuals.",10.1186/s12889-024-20028-4,1,Scopus,85204417727,2-s2.0-85204417727,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204417727
Primary care physicians’ perceptions of artificial intelligence systems in the care of adolescents’ mental health,Ghadiri P.,2024,BMC Primary Care,"Background: Given that mental health problems in adolescence may have lifelong impacts, the role of primary care physicians (PCPs) in identifying and managing these issues is important. Artificial Intelligence (AI) may offer solutions to the current challenges involved in mental health care. We therefore explored PCPs’ challenges in addressing adolescents’ mental health, along with their attitudes towards using AI to assist them in their tasks. Methods: We used purposeful sampling to recruit PCPs for a virtual Focus Group (FG). The virtual FG lasted 75 minutes and was moderated by two facilitators. A life transcription was produced by an online meeting software. Transcribed data was cleaned, followed by a priori and inductive coding and thematic analysis. Results: We reached out to 35 potential participants via email. Seven agreed to participate, and ultimately four took part in the FG. PCPs perceived that AI systems have the potential to be cost-effective, credible, and useful in collecting large amounts of patients’ data, and relatively credible. They envisioned AI assisting with tasks such as diagnoses and establishing treatment plans. However, they feared that reliance on AI might result in a loss of clinical competency. PCPs wanted AI systems to be user-friendly, and they were willing to assist in achieving this goal if it was within their scope of practice and they were compensated for their contribution. They stressed a need for regulatory bodies to deal with medicolegal and ethical aspects of AI and clear guidelines to reduce or eliminate the potential of patient harm. Conclusion: This study provides the groundwork for assessing PCPs’ perceptions of AI systems’ features and characteristics, potential applications, possible negative aspects, and requirements for using them. A future study of adolescents’ perspectives on integrating AI into mental healthcare might contribute a fuller understanding of the potential of AI for this population.",10.1186/s12875-024-02417-1,5,Scopus,85195953673,2-s2.0-85195953673,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195953673
A mobile healthy lifestyle intervention to promote mental health in adolescence: a mixed-methods evaluation,Peuters C.,2024,BMC Public Health,"Background: A healthy lifestyle may improve mental health. It is yet not known whether and how a mobile intervention can be of help in achieving this in adolescents. This study investigated the effectiveness and perceived underlying mechanisms of the mobile health (mHealth) intervention #LIFEGOALS to promote healthy lifestyles and mental health. #LIFEGOALS is an evidence-based app with activity tracker, including self-regulation techniques, gamification elements, a support chatbot, and health narrative videos. Methods: A quasi-randomized controlled trial (N = 279) with 12-week intervention period and process evaluation interviews (n = 13) took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents (12-15y) from the general population were allocated at school-level to the intervention (n = 184) or to a no-intervention group (n = 95). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological well-being, mood, self-perception, peer support, resilience, depressed feelings, sleep quality and breakfast frequency were assessed via a web-based survey; physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep routine via Axivity accelerometers. Multilevel generalized linear models were fitted to investigate intervention effects and moderation by pandemic-related measures. Interviews were coded using thematic analysis. Results: Non-usage attrition was high: 18% of the participants in the intervention group never used the app. An additional 30% stopped usage by the second week. Beneficial intervention effects were found for physical activity (χ <sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf> = 4.36, P =.04), sedentary behavior (χ <sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf> = 6.44, P =.01), sleep quality (χ <sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf> = 6.11, P =.01), and mood (χ <sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf> = 2.30, P =.02). However, effects on activity-related behavior were only present for adolescents having normal sports access, and effects on mood only for adolescents with full in-school education. HRQoL (χ <sup>2</sup><inf>2</inf> = 14.72, P <.001), mood (χ <sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf> = 6.03, P =.01), and peer support (χ <sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf> = 13.69, P <.001) worsened in adolescents with pandemic-induced remote-education. Interviewees reported that the reward system, self-regulation guidance, and increased health awareness had contributed to their behavior change. They also pointed to the importance of social factors, quality of technology and autonomy for mHealth effectiveness. Conclusions: #LIFEGOALS showed mixed results on health behaviors and mental health. The findings highlight the role of contextual factors for mHealth promotion in adolescence, and provide suggestions to optimize support by a chatbot and narrative episodes.

Methods: Here, we analyzed data of 278 adolescents that were collected in a nation-wide survey provided via a smartphone-based application during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used an elastic net regression machine-learning approach to classify individuals with clinically relevant self-reported symptoms of depression or anxiety. We then identified the most important variables with a combination of permutation feature importance calculation and sequential logistic regressions. Results: 40.30% of participants reported clinically relevant anxiety symptoms, and 37.69% reported depressive symptoms. Both machine-learning models performed well in classifying participants with depressive (AUROC = 0.77) or anxiety (AUROC = 0.83) symptoms and were significantly better than the no-information rate. Feature importance analyses revealed that anxiety and depression in adolescence are commonly related to sleep disturbances (anxiety OR = 2.12, depression OR = 1.80). Differentiating between symptoms, self-reported depression increased with decreasing life satisfaction (OR = 0.43), whereas self-reported anxiety was related to worries about the health of family and friends (OR = 1.98) as well as impulsivity (OR = 2.01). Conclusion: Our results show that app-based self-reports provide information that can classify symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescence and thus offer new insights into symptom patterns related to adolescent mental health issues. These findings underscore the potentials of health apps in reaching large cohorts of adolescence and optimize diagnostic and treatment.",10.1186/s13034-024-00793-1,3,Scopus,85201404636,2-s2.0-85201404636,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201404636
Tree hole rescue: an AI approach for suicide risk detection and online suicide intervention,Huang Z.,2024,Health Information Science and Systems,"Adolescent suicide has become an important social issue of general concern. Many young people express their suicidal feelings and intentions through online social media, e.g., Twitter, Microblog. The ""tree hole"" is the Chinese name for places on the Web where people post secrets. It provides the possibility of using Artificial Intelligence and big data technology to detect the posts where someone express the suicidal signal from those “tree hole” social media. We have developed the Web-based intelligent agents (i.e., AI-based programs) which can monitor the “tree hole” websites in Microblog every day by using knowledge graph technology. We have organized Tree-hole Rescue Team, which consists of more than 1000 volunteers, to carry out suicide rescue intervention according to the daily monitoring notifications. From 2018 to 2023, Tree-hole Rescue Team has prevented more than 6600 suicides. A few thousands of people have been saved within those 6 years. In this paper, we present the basic technology of Web-based Tree Hole intelligent agents and elaborate how the intelligent agents can discover suicide attempts and issue corresponding monitoring notifications and how the volunteers of Tree Hole Rescue Team can conduct online suicide intervention. This research also shows that the knowledge graph approach can be used for the semantic analysis on social media",10.1007/s13755-024-00298-3,2,Scopus,85202998743,2-s2.0-85202998743,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202998743
Improving automatic cyberbullying detection in social network environments by fine-tuning a pre-trained sentence transformer language model,Gutiérrez-Batista K.,2024,Social Network Analysis and Mining,"The internet use among children and adolescents has increased massively recently. This situation has promoted harmful situations such as cyberbullying, which is becoming a worldwide problem that entails serious consequences for well-being. The detection of these attitudes is essential to prevent and act accordingly. Groundbreaking techniques based on deep learning, like pre-trained language models, have achieved state-of-the-art results in many downstream Natural Language Processing tasks. This paper presents a simple but effective approach to improve the detection of cyberbullying situations by fine-tuning a pre-trained sentence transformer language model. We experimented on three datasets, and the results surpassed the state-of-the-art results. The approach could help prevent cyberbullying, filter those messages, and detect those children involved in the situation, providing opportunities to develop intervention programs to address this problem.",10.1007/s13278-024-01291-0,8,Scopus,85198627986,2-s2.0-85198627986,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198627986
Prediction of emergency department revisits among child and youth mental health outpatients using deep learning techniques,Saggu S.,2024,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,"Background: The proportion of Canadian youth seeking mental health support from an emergency department (ED) has risen in recent years. As EDs typically address urgent mental health crises, revisiting an ED may represent unmet mental health needs. Accurate ED revisit prediction could aid early intervention and ensure efficient healthcare resource allocation. We examine the potential increased accuracy and performance of graph neural network (GNN) machine learning models compared to recurrent neural network (RNN), and baseline conventional machine learning and regression models for predicting ED revisit in electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods: This study used EHR data for children and youth aged 4–17 seeking services at McMaster Children’s Hospital’s Child and Youth Mental Health Program outpatient service to develop and evaluate GNN and RNN models to predict whether a child/youth with an ED visit had an ED revisit within 30 days. GNN and RNN models were developed and compared against conventional baseline models. Model performance for GNN, RNN, XGBoost, decision tree and logistic regression models was evaluated using F1 scores. Results: The GNN model outperformed the RNN model by an F1-score increase of 0.0511 and the best performing conventional machine learning model by an F1-score increase of 0.0470. Precision, recall, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and positive and negative predictive values showed that the GNN model performed the best, and the RNN model performed similarly to the XGBoost model. Performance increases were most noticeable for recall and negative predictive value than for precision and positive predictive value. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the improved accuracy and potential utility of GNN models in predicting ED revisits among children and youth, although model performance may not be sufficient for clinical implementation. Given the improvements in recall and negative predictive value, GNN models should be further explored to develop algorithms that can inform clinical decision-making in ways that facilitate targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation, and improve outcomes for children and youth.",10.1186/s12911-024-02450-1,9,Scopus,85184786553,2-s2.0-85184786553,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184786553
"Review of Current Trends in LGBTQ + Youth and Social Media: Implications for Mental Health, Identity Development, and Civic Engagement",Bacaj C.,2024,Current Pediatrics Reports,"Purpose of Review: This review looks at current trends in the effect of social media use on mental health, identity development, and civic engagement for LGBTQ + youth during the post-pandemic period, when online engagement has significantly increased. It explores both risks and benefits associated with this shift and offers recommendations for clinicians and future research in this evolving landscape. Recent Findings: There is an intricate relationship between the harms and benefits of social media use and developing adolescents. While some research suggests that social media use and overuse is associated with negative outcomes such as depression and anxiety, many recent studies have found that, for LGBTQ + youth in particular, social media may be a necessary safe space they have for representation and community building, especially when absent in their physical world. It is important to look at the nuances behind social media use motivations and adolescents’ intersectional identities when understanding and developing personalized interventions for mental health. Summary: The review looks at how LGBTQ + youth have used social media since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to increase their own agency and build community through developing their own safe spaces online. LGBTQ + youth’s hidden and intersectional identities might isolate them within their home and community environments, which must be considered when thinking about controlling adolescent social media use. Ongoing research should look into the relationship between social media use and LGBTQ + adolescent mental health at a more granular level, rather than just LGBTQ + vs. heterosexual peers to further tailored interventions.",10.1007/s40124-024-00338-2,0,Scopus,85217550480,2-s2.0-85217550480,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217550480
Analysing Digital Engagement Patterns: A Machine Learning Investigation into Social Anxiety Among Adolescents with ADHD,Șipoș R.,2024,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: The relationship between screen time and mental health among adolescents, particularly those identified as “digital natives”, has become increasingly pertinent, especially in the context of heightened digital engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to examine the associations between digital engagement patterns, ADHD severity, and anxiety symptoms in adolescents aged 11–18. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted with a sample of 97 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. Participants completed validated questionnaires assessing daily digital activities and anxiety symptoms while caregivers provided additional contextual information. Data were analyzed using Random Forest regression to identify relationships between screen time, ADHD severity, and anxiety symptoms. Results: The findings indicate an average screen time of 6.6 h on weekdays and 8.1 h on weekends, with social media emerging as the primary activity, particularly among female participants. Notable gender differences were identified, with family dynamics influencing digital engagement; family disputes had a more significant impact on girls than boys. Furthermore, specific anxiety traits, i.e., physical symptoms and harm avoidance, significantly predicted time spent on social media across all genders considered in the study, while others, namely social anxiety and separation anxiety, were less valuable. Conclusions: This study highlights the complex interplay between screen time, ADHD, and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. These findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions that address the nuanced relationships between digital engagement and mental health in this population, warranting further research to develop effective management strategies.",10.3390/jcm13237461,1,Scopus,85212210506,2-s2.0-85212210506,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212210506
Improving health awareness with real-time monitoring through a three-dimensional visualized digital health avatar,Chokphukhiao C.,2024,Smart Health,"Introduction: The use of modern technologies has become crucial for enhancing people's awareness of health problems. By early health risk detection, there will be better treatment outcomes, the severity of illness will decrease, and costs for treatment will also reduce. Performing routine checkups could help patients feel less anxious about their health in the future. In this study, the innovation of “Digital Health Avatar” enables users to monitor physical changes, raise awareness of medical conditions, and encourage healthy behaviors by visualizing health status as a 3D figure. Methods: Health data were collected using medical devices like blood test strips, body composition meters, and automatic blood pressure monitors. API technology and cloud computing systems were used to process these collected data and produced a three-dimensional avatar that indicated the user's health status. User satisfaction survey on using the health avatar system was assessed through a survey of 61 participants.

HIV interventions across the care continuum for adolescents in high-burden countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Tao Y.,2024,Eclinicalmedicine,"Background: Adolescents (10–19 years old) have poor outcomes across the prevention-to-treatment HIV care continuum, leading to significant mortality and morbidity. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions that documented HIV outcomes among adolescents in HIV high-burden countries. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between January 2015 and September 2024, assessing at least one HIV outcome along the prevention-to-care cascade, including PrEP uptake, HIV testing, awareness of HIV infections, ARV adherence, retention, and virological suppression. We included studies from 37 HIV high-burden countries evaluating interventions with a comparator group. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the effects of the interventions on study outcomes. While the primary focus was on outcomes related to the HIV care cascade, we also evaluated social outcomes and mental health outcomes when sufficient data were available. Adolescent engagement in studies was assessed using Hart's ladder. The study was registered in PROSPERO, CRD42024569203. Findings: We identified 12,411 unique records, of which 99 were included in the final analysis, comprising 57 randomized controlled trials and 42 non-randomized studies, with a total sample size of 441,252 participants. Our analysis found that asset-building interventions significantly improved HIV testing uptake (three studies, RR: 1.38, 95% CI 1.15–1.65) compared to control conditions. Differentiated service delivery interventions were associated with improved ART retention (five studies, RR: 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.36) and virological suppression (seven studies, RR: 1.19, 95% CI 1.06–1.33) compared to control conditions. Financial incentives significantly enhanced ART adherence (two studies, RR: 1.52, 95% CI 1.23–1.89) compared to control conditions. Digital interventions, such as mobile phone applications and telehealth services, significantly increased HIV testing uptake (two studies, RR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.23–2.61) compared to control conditions. Positive impacts were also observed for these interventions on social outcomes. Most studies adopted minimal to moderate adolescent engagement. For HIV testing, a stronger effect was seen in studies with moderate to substantial adolescent engagement, yielding an RR of 2.37 (95% CI: 1.43–3.93; nine studies), compared to a lower RR of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.15–1.31; 13 studies) in studies with minimal engagement. Notably, the strength of evidence is moderate to low due to the considerable heterogeneity across studies and limited included studies. Interpretation: Our data demonstrate several evidence-based interventions that can enhance adolescent HIV outcomes across the care continuum. Our findings are relevant in many HIV high-burden countries and can help to inform national and regional adolescent HIV policy. Funding: This study was supported by UNICEF, the Adolescent HIV Prevention and Treatment Implementation Science Alliance (AHISA), and the US NIH (NIAID K24AI143471, NICHD 1UG1HD113156, UM2HD116395).",10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102989,4,Scopus,85211720409,2-s2.0-85211720409,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211720409
Investigating school absenteeism and refusal among Australian children and adolescents using Apriori association rule mining,Haque U.M.,2024,Scientific Reports,"Identifying and determining the multitude of reasons behind school absences of students is often challenging. This study aims to uncover the hidden reasons for school absence in children and adolescents. The analysis is conducted on a national survey that includes 2967 Australian children and adolescents aged 11–17. The Apriori association rule generator of machine learning techniques and binary logistic regression are used to identify the significant predictors of school absences. Out of 2484, 83.7% (n = 2079) aged (11–17) years children and adolescents have missed school for various reasons, 42.28% (n = 879) are (11–15) years old, 24.52% (n = 609) and 16.9% (n = 420) are 16- and 17-years old adolescents respectively. A considerable proportion of adolescents, specifically 16.4% (n = 407) and 23.4% (n = 486) of 16 and 17 years old, respectively, have selected ‘refused to say’ as their reason for not attending school. It also highlights the negative outcomes associated with undisclosed reasons for school absence, such as bullying, excessive internet/gaming, reduced family involvement, suicide attempts, and existential hopelessness. The findings of the national survey underscore the importance of addressing these undisclosed reasons for school absence to improve the overall well-being and educational outcomes of children and adolescents.",10.1038/s41598-024-51230-4,4,Scopus,85182868756,2-s2.0-85182868756,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182868756
SSRI use during acute COVID-19 and risk of long COVID among patients with depression,Butzin-Dozier Z.,2024,BMC Medicine,"Background: Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), is a poorly understood condition with symptoms across a range of biological domains that often have debilitating consequences. Some have recently suggested that lingering SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in the gut may impede serotonin production and that low serotonin may drive many Long COVID symptoms across a range of biological systems. Therefore, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which increase synaptic serotonin availability, may be used to prevent or treat Long COVID. SSRIs are commonly prescribed for depression, therefore restricting a study sample to only include patients with depression can reduce the concern of confounding by indication. Methods: In an observational sample of electronic health records from patients in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) with a COVID-19 diagnosis between September 1, 2021, and December 1, 2022, and a comorbid depressive disorder, the leading indication for SSRI use, we evaluated the relationship between SSRI use during acute COVID-19 and subsequent 12-month risk of Long COVID (defined by ICD-10 code U09.9). We defined SSRI use as a prescription for SSRI medication beginning at least 30 days before acute COVID-19 and not ending before SARS-CoV-2 infection. To minimize bias, we estimated relationships using nonparametric targeted maximum likelihood estimation to aggressively adjust for high-dimensional covariates. Results: We analyzed a sample (n = 302,626) of patients with a diagnosis of a depressive condition before COVID-19 diagnosis, where 100,803 (33%) were using an SSRI. We found that SSRI users had a significantly lower risk of Long COVID compared to nonusers (adjusted causal relative risk 0.92, 95% CI (0.86, 0.99)) and we found a similar relationship comparing new SSRI users (first SSRI prescription 1 to 4 months before acute COVID-19 with no prior history of SSRI use) to nonusers (adjusted causal relative risk 0.89, 95% CI (0.80, 0.98)). Conclusions: These findings suggest that SSRI use during acute COVID-19 may be protective against Long COVID, supporting the hypothesis that serotonin may be a key mechanistic biomarker of Long COVID.",10.1186/s12916-024-03655-x,7,Scopus,85206036189,2-s2.0-85206036189,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206036189
Exploring the Effects of User-Agent and User-Designer Similarity in Virtual Human Design to Promote Mental Health Intentions for College Students,Feijóo-García P.G.,2024,ACM Transactions on Applied Perception,"Virtual humans (i.e., embodied conversational agents) have the potential to support college students' mental health, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields where students are at a heightened risk of mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. A comprehensive understanding of students, considering their cultural characteristics, experiences, and expectations, is crucial for creating timely and effective virtual human interventions. To this end, we conducted a user study with 481 computer science students from a major university in North America, exploring how they co-designed virtual humans to support mental health conversations for students similar to them. Our findings suggest that computer science students who engage in co-design processes of virtual humans tend to create agents that closely resemble them demographically - agent-designer demographic similarity. Key factors influencing virtual human design included age, gender, ethnicity, and the matching between appearance and voice. We also observed that the demographic characteristics of virtual human designers, especially ethnicity and gender, tend to be associated with those of the virtual humans they designed. Finally, we provide insights concerning the impact of user-designer demographic similarity in virtual humans' effectiveness in promoting mental health conversations when designers' characteristics are shared explicitly or implicitly. Understanding how virtual humans' characteristics serve users' experiences in mental wellness conversations and the similarity-attraction effects between agents, users, and designers may help tailor virtual humans' design to enhance their acceptance and increase their counseling effectiveness.",10.1145/3689822,7,Scopus,85212851510,2-s2.0-85212851510,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212851510
Predictive machine learning model for mental health issues in higher education students due to COVID-19 using HADS assessment,Krishnan R.,2024,Arab Gulf Journal of Scientific Research,"Purpose: Students pursuing different professional courses at the higher education level during 2021–2022 saw the first-time occurrence of a pandemic in the form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and their mental health was affected. Many works are available in the literature to assess mental health severity. However, it is necessary to identify the affected students early for effective treatment. Design/methodology/approach: Predictive analytics, a part of machine learning (ML), helps with early identification based on mental health severity levels to aid clinical psychologists. As a case study, engineering and medical course students were comparatively analysed in this work as they have rich course content and a stricter evaluation process than other streams. The methodology includes an online survey that obtains demographic details, academic qualifications, family details, etc. and anxiety and depression questions using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The responses acquired through social media networks are analysed using ML algorithms – support vector machines (SVMs) (robust handling of health information) and J48 decision tree (DT) (interpretability/comprehensibility). Also, random forest is used to identify the predictors for anxiety and depression. Findings: The results show that the support vector classifier produces outperforming results with classification accuracy of 100%, 1.0 precision and 1.0 recall, followed by the J48 DT classifier with 96%. It was found that medical students are affected by anxiety and depression marginally more when compared with engineering students. Research limitations/implications: The entire work is dependent on the social media-displayed online questionnaire, and the participants were not met in person. This indicates that the response rate could not be evaluated appropriately. Due to the medical restrictions imposed by COVID-19, which remain in effect in 2022, this is the only method found to collect primary data from college students. Additionally, students self-selected themselves to participate in this survey, which raises the possibility of selection bias. Practical implications: The responses acquired through social media networks are analysed using ML algorithms. This will be a big support for understanding the mental issues of the students due to COVID-19 and can taking appropriate actions to rectify them. This will improve the quality of the learning process in higher education in Oman. Social implications: Furthermore, this study aims to provide recommendations for mental health screening as a regular practice in educational institutions to identify undetected students. Originality/value: Comparing the mental health issues of two professional course students is the novelty of this work. This is needed because both studies require practical learning, long hours of work, etc.",10.1108/AGJSR-01-2023-0034,4,Scopus,85177546893,2-s2.0-85177546893,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177546893
MindScape Study: Integrating LLM and Behavioral Sensing for Personalized AI-Driven Journaling Experiences,Nepal S.,2024,Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies,"Mental health concerns are prevalent among college students, highlighting the need for effective interventions that promote self-awareness and holistic well-being. MindScape explores a novel approach to AI-powered journaling by integrating passively collected behavioral patterns such as conversational engagement, sleep, and location with Large Language Models (LLMs). This integration creates a highly personalized and context-aware journaling experience, enhancing self-awareness and well-being by embedding behavioral intelligence into AI. We present an 8-week exploratory study with 20 college students, demonstrating the MindScape app's efficacy in enhancing positive affect (7%), reducing negative affect (11%), loneliness (6%), and anxiety and depression, with a significant week-over-week decrease in PHQ-4 scores (-0.25 coefficient). The study highlights the advantages of contextual AI journaling, with participants particularly appreciating the tailored prompts and insights provided by the MindScape app. Our analysis also includes a comparison of responses to AI-driven contextual versus generic prompts, participant feedback insights, and proposed strategies for leveraging contextual AI journaling to improve well-being on college campuses. By showcasing the potential of contextual AI journaling to support mental health, we provide a foundation for further investigation into the effects of contextual AI journaling on mental health and well-being.",10.1145/3699761,11,Scopus,85210309740,2-s2.0-85210309740,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210309740
Improving personalized predictions through nonlinear individual-specific parameters in neural network-based mixed effect models,Ramesh B.,2024,Aip Conference Proceedings,"For sequential tasks, such as daily mood ratings, personalized prediction - a machine learning method - can be useful since it predicts future observations based on a person's past labelled observations. If want the model to make predictions based on your unique characteristics, it can consider both (a) general trends that people share (person-generic trends), like how much fun weekends are, and (b) trends that are specific to you (person-specific trends), like how stressful your weekly meeting is. A prominent statistical model for studying trends and individual differences is the mixed effect model, which uses both generic and person-specific characteristics. Although neural network integrations are making linear mixed effect models more common in machine learning, these integrations only function with linear person-specific parameters, therefore they can't account for nonlinear person-specific trends. Our paper presents the idea of Neural Mixed Effect (NME) models, which can be used to scalable optimization of nonlinear parameters particular to individuals within a neural network. NME is a method that integrates nonlinear mixed effects modelling with neural network optimization for maximum efficiency. From an empirical standpoint, we can see that NME enhances performance on six different types of datasets, including one for daily mood prediction using a smartphone and another for predicting emotional state sequences in a mother-adolescent dataset, where 50% of mothers report depressive symptoms. Neuronal conditional random fields (CRF) is one of the two model structures that we evaluate for NME; it acquires nonlinear person-specific sequential transitions among emotional statement and is employed for emotional state sequence forecasting. Through the examination of these transitions specific to each individual on the mother-adolescent dataset, observable patterns pertaining to the mother's depression symptoms can be revealed.",10.1063/5.0235481,0,Scopus,85210252136,2-s2.0-85210252136,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210252136
Unpacking the role of motivation and enjoyment in AI-mediated informal digital learning of English (AI-IDLE): A mixed-method investigation in the Chinese context,Liu G.L.,2024,Computers in Human Behavior,"This paper examines how Chinese university students negotiate their second language (L2) motivational dynamics, including their ideal and ought-to L2 selves, to participate in informal digital learning of English (IDLE) mediated by generative artificial intelligence (AI). It demonstrates the extent to which enjoyment, the most observable positive emotion in L2 learning, influences their involvement in AI-mediated IDLE (AI-IDLE) activities. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design, this study surveyed 690 Chinese undergraduate students and conducted 12 post-survey interviews. Using a structural equation modeling approach, the quantitative analysis reveals that participants’ ideal L2 self can significantly predict both their sense of enjoyment and AI-IDLE, while the ought-to L2 self is only able to directly predict enjoyment. The quantitative results also demonstrate that enjoyment can partially mediate the relationship between the ideal L2 self and AI-IDLE and simultaneously fully channel the indirect impact of the ought-to L2 self on AI-IDLE. Supplementing these quantitative findings, the interview data provides a nuanced understanding of how motivation and enjoyment shift and interact with learning contexts as participants engage in AI-IDLE. Drawing on these quantitative and qualitative insights, this study identifies implications for pedagogy, particularly in terms of motivating Chinese university students to engage in IDLE while maintaining emotional well-being in the age of generative AI.",10.1016/j.chb.2024.108362,61,Scopus,85198307025,2-s2.0-85198307025,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198307025

Mediating Effect Of Stress Response and Grit On the Relationship Between Stress and Depression In Nursing Students: Emperical Research Quantitative,Jeon J.,2024,Nursing Open,"Aims: To explore the prevalence of depression amongst Korean nursing students and to identify the mediating effect of stress response and grit in the relationship between stress and depression in the same population. Design: A total of 184 nursing students from Korea were included. This study was cross-sectional with a structured questionnaire that included stress, stress response, grit, and depression. Methods: The study participants were university students from four nursing colleges located in the metropolitan area and Gangwon-do in South Korea. The data collection period spanned from February 24 to March 30, 2023, using an online questionnaire following the G University's Institutional Review Board's (IRB's) deliberation. Results: Amongst the participants, the prevalence of depression was 23.8% (95% CI: [17.7%, 29.9%]), and 13.7% had moderate depression, whereas 10.1% had severe depression. The direct effects of stress on stress response (t = 9.26, p < 0.001) and from stress to grit (t = 22.82, p < 0.001) were statistically significant. The direct effects from stress to depression (t = 2.61, p = 0.009), from stress response to depression (t = 9.68, p < 0.001), and from grit to depression (t = −2.09, p = 0.039) were also statistically significant. The association between stress and depression was mediated by stress response but not grit. Conclusions: The prevalence of depression amongst Korean nursing students was high. Preparing strategies against depression amongst nursing students is an urgent matter. The mediating effect of stress response in the relationship between stress and depression was statistically significant, but that for grit was not. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate students' stress responses and provide personalised interventions, as well as reduce established stressors. Implications for the Profession: Strategies to manage stress responses can be used to reduce depression caused by stress in nursing students. Impact: To reduce depression in nursing students, it is necessary to investigate strategies to understand stress response, provide personalised interventions, and reduce already-known stressors. Reporting Method: The authors have adhered to relevant EQUATOR guidelines using the STROBE checklist: cross-sectional studies. Patient or Public Contribution: Nursing students were the subjects of data collection for this study and participated in the survey upon voluntary consent to participation.",10.1002/nop2.70096,0,Scopus,85210100150,2-s2.0-85210100150,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210100150
A transdiagnostic prodrome for severe mental disorders: an electronic health record study,Arribas M.,2024,Molecular Psychiatry,"Effective prevention of severe mental disorders (SMD), including non-psychotic unipolar mood disorders (UMD), non-psychotic bipolar mood disorders (BMD), and psychotic disorders (PSY), rely on accurate knowledge of the duration, first presentation, time course and transdiagnosticity of their prodromal stages. Here we present a retrospective, real-world, cohort study using electronic health records, adhering to RECORD guidelines. Natural language processing algorithms were used to extract monthly occurrences of 65 prodromal features (symptoms and substance use), grouped into eight prodromal clusters. The duration, first presentation, and transdiagnosticity of the prodrome were compared between SMD groups with one-way ANOVA, Cohen’s f and d. The time course (mean occurrences) of prodromal clusters was compared between SMD groups with linear mixed-effects models. 26,975 individuals diagnosed with ICD-10 SMD were followed up for up to 12 years (UMD = 13,422; BMD = 2506; PSY = 11,047; median[IQR] age 39.8[23.7] years; 55% female; 52% white). The duration of the UMD prodrome (18[36] months) was shorter than BMD (26[35], d = 0.21) and PSY (24[38], d = 0.18). Most individuals presented with multiple first prodromal clusters, with the most common being non-specific (‘other’; 88% UMD, 85% BMD, 78% PSY). The only first prodromal cluster that showed a medium-sized difference between the three SMD groups was positive symptoms (f = 0.30). Time course analysis showed an increase in prodromal cluster occurrences approaching SMD onset. Feature occurrence across the prodromal period showed small/negligible differences between SMD groups, suggesting that most features are transdiagnostic, except for positive symptoms (e.g. paranoia, f = 0.40). Taken together, our findings show minimal differences in the duration and first presentation of the SMD prodromes as recorded in secondary mental health care. All the prodromal clusters intensified as individuals approached SMD onset, and all the prodromal features other than positive symptoms are transdiagnostic. These results support proposals to develop transdiagnostic preventive services for affective and psychotic disorders detected in secondary mental healthcare.",10.1038/s41380-024-02533-5,8,Scopus,85192187704,2-s2.0-85192187704,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192187704
Debate: How much should nonspecialists be involved in mental health care for children and young people when resources are limited?,Gega L.,2024,Child and Adolescent Mental Health,"From the barber-surgeons of the Middle Ages to the digitally enabled clinical interventions of today, the role of nonspecialists in delivering accessible health care remains relevant and important. Their contribution in developing and supporting appropriate interventions and care pathways in the community can make a big difference for the overwhelming majority of children and young people with diagnosable mental health conditions who are not eligible for specialist treatment or do not seek help. Even if resources for specialist services were unlimited, there are independent benefits in involving nonspecialists in mental health care, albeit not without limitations and concerns. The natural shift over time in the boundaries of specialisms, the omnipresence and omnipotence of digital media in our lives and the vision of ‘no wrong door’ for service users, mean that it is not a question of whether, but of how, nonspecialists should be involved. We need to get past the point of considering them just as alternative providers of mental health interventions and services. Instead, they are best placed to protect children and young people's mental health through ubiquitous everyday actions, which counter the negative and maximise the positive elements in current practices, environments and interactions that influence families and communities.",10.1111/camh.12737,0,Scopus,85204486462,2-s2.0-85204486462,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204486462
Effects of Chatbot Components to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals With Eating Disorders Following Online Screening: An Optimization Randomized Controlled Trial,Fitzsimmons-Craft E.E.,2024,International Journal of Eating Disorders,"Objective: Few individuals with eating disorders (EDs) receive treatment. Innovations are needed to identify individuals with EDs and address care barriers. We developed a chatbot for promoting services uptake that could be paired with online screening. However, it is not yet known which components drive effects. This study estimated individual and combined contributions of four chatbot components on mental health services use (primary), chatbot helpfulness, and attitudes toward changing eating/shape/weight concerns (“change attitudes,” with higher scores indicating greater importance/readiness). Methods: Two hundred five individuals screening with an ED but not in treatment were randomized in an optimization randomized controlled trial to receive up to four chatbot components: psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, personalized service recommendations, and repeated administration (follow-up check-ins/reminders). Assessments were at baseline and 2, 6, and 14 weeks. Results: Participants who received repeated administration were more likely to report mental health services use, with no significant effects of other components on services use. Repeated administration slowed the decline in change attitudes participants experienced over time. Participants who received motivational interviewing found the chatbot more helpful, but this component was also associated with larger declines in change attitudes. Participants who received personalized recommendations found the chatbot more helpful, and receiving this component on its own was associated with the most favorable change attitude time trend. Psychoeducation showed no effects. Discussion: Results indicated important effects of components on outcomes; findings will be used to finalize decision making about the optimized intervention package. The chatbot shows high potential for addressing the treatment gap for EDs.",10.1002/eat.24260,8,Scopus,85200044004,2-s2.0-85200044004,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200044004
Assessing last month's stress levels with an automated facial behavior scan,Naber M.,2024,Acta Psychologica,"Stress is one of the most pressing problems in society as it severely reduces the physical and mental wellbeing of people. It is therefore of great importance to accurately monitor stress levels, especially in work environments. However, contemporary stress assessments, such as questionnaires and physiological measurements, have practical limitations, mostly related to their subjective or contact-based nature. To assess stress objectively and conveniently, we developed an automated model that detects biomarkers in webcam-recorded facial behavior indicative of heightened stress levels, using computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques. Heart-rate induced skin pulsations and facial muscle activity were extracted from videos of 264 participants that performed an online mental capacity test under considerable time pressure. The model could successfully use these facial biomarkers to explain a significant proportion of individual differences in scores on a self-perceived stress scale. Next, we used the model to objectively score stress levels of 63 military candidates (pre-hiring) and 69 military personnel (post-hiring) that also performed the mental capacity test. Results showed that military personnel expressed facial behavior indicative of significantly higher stress levels than military candidates. This suggests that joining the military heightens overall stress levels. With this study we take the first steps towards a non-contact, automated, and objective measure of stress that is easily applicable in a variety of health and work contexts.",10.1016/j.actpsy.2024.104645,0,Scopus,85211169209,2-s2.0-85211169209,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211169209
"Compulsive ChatGPT usage, anxiety, burnout, and sleep disturbance: A serial mediation model based on stimulus-organism-response perspective",Duong C.D.,2024,Acta Psychologica,"The limited understanding of the detrimental repercussions stemming from the adoption of artificial intelligence, exemplified by ChatGPT, on users' mental health issues underscores the urgency of our current research endeavor. In response to this knowledge gap, our study employs the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework and implements a serial mediation model to probe into the impacts of compulsive ChatGPT usage on users' mental health outcomes. This model serves as a powerful analytical lens, allowing us to unravel the relationships between the stimulus (compulsive ChatGPT usage), organism (anxiety and burnout), and response (sleep disturbance). Using a cross-sectional survey design, we collected data from 2602 ChatGPT users in Vietnam via purposive sampling and utilized structural equation modeling to assess the hypothesis model. The findings confirm that compulsive ChatGPT usage directly correlates with heightened anxiety, burnout, and sleep disturbance. Moreover, compulsive usage indirectly contributes to sleep disturbance through anxiety and burnout, demonstrating a significant serial mediation effect. This expanded understanding, derived from a sizable and diverse user base, positions our research at the forefront of unraveling the intricate dynamics between AI adoption and mental well-being.",10.1016/j.actpsy.2024.104622,4,Scopus,85211062393,2-s2.0-85211062393,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211062393
Predicting cannabis use moderation among a sample of digital self-help subscribers: A machine learning study,Olthof M.I.A.,2024,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,"Background: For individuals who wish to reduce their cannabis use without formal help, there are a variety of self-help tools available. Although some are proven to be effective in reducing cannabis use, effect sizes are typically small. More insight into predictors of successful reduction of use among individuals who frequently use cannabis and desire to reduce/quit could help identify factors that contribute to successful cannabis use moderation. Methods: We analyzed data taken from a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of the digital cannabis intervention ICan to four online modules of educational information on cannabis. For the current study, we included 253 participants. Success was defined as reducing the grams of cannabis used in the past 7 days at baseline by at least 50 % at 6-month follow-up. To train and evaluate the machine learning models we used a nested k-fold cross-validation procedure. Results: The results show that the two models applied had comparable low AUROC values of .61 (Random Forest) and .57 (Logistic Regression). Not identifying oneself as a cannabis user, not using tobacco products, high levels of depressive symptoms, high levels of psychological distress and high initial cannabis use values were the relatively most important predictors for success, although overall the associations were not strong. Conclusions: Our study found only modest prediction accuracy when using machine learning models to predict success among individuals who use cannabis and desire to reduce/quit and show interest in digital self-help tools.",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2024.112431,0,Scopus,85204052128,2-s2.0-85204052128,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204052128
Methodological approaches in developing and implementing digital health interventions amongst underserved women,Crawford A.D.,2024,Public Health Nursing,"Background: Minority populations are utilizing mobile health applications more frequently to access health information. One group that may benefit from using mHealth technology is underserved women, specifically those on community supervision. Objective: Discuss methodological approaches for navigating digital health strategies to address underserved women's health disparities. Description of the innovative method: Using an intersectional lens, we identified strategies for conducting research using digital health technology and artificial intelligence amongst the underserved, particularly those with community supervision. Description of its effectiveness: We explore (1) methodological approaches that combine traditional research methods with precision medicine, digital phenotyping, and ecological momentary assessment; (2) implications for artificial intelligence; and (3) ethical considerations with data collection, storage, and engagement. Discussion: Researchers must address gendered differences related to health, social, and economic disparities concurrently with an unwavering focus on the protection of human subjects when addressing the unique needs of underserved women while utilizing digital health methodologies. Public contribution: Women on community supervision in South Central Texas helped inform the design of JUN, the mHealth app we reported in the case exemplar.

Association of Postpartum Temperature Exposure with Postpartum Depression: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Southern California,Sun Y.,2024,Environmental Health Perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) has been associated with biological, emotional, social, and environmental factors. However, evidence regarding the effect of temperature on PPD is extremely limited. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the associations between postpartum temperature exposure and PPD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California electronic health records from 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2018. PPD was first assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (score ≥10) during the first year of the postpartum period and further identified by using both diagnostic codes and prescription medications. Historical daily ambient temperatures were obtained from the 4-km resolution gridMET dataset (https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html) and linked to participants’ residential addresses at delivery. Postpartum temperature exposures were measured by calculating various temperature metrics during the period from delivery to PPD diagnosis date. A time-to-event approach with a discrete-time logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between temperature exposure and time to PPD. Effect modification by maternal characteristics and other environmental factors was examined. RESULTS: There were 46,114 (10.73%) PPD cases among 429,839 pregnancies (mean ± standard deviation age = 30:22 ± 5:75 y). Increased PPD risks were positively associated with exposure to higher mean temperature [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per interquartile range increment: 1.07; 95% confi-dence interval (CI): 1.05, 1.09] and diurnal temperature range (aOR = 1:08; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.10); the associations were stronger for maximum temperature compared with minimum temperature. The temperature-related PPD risks were greater among African American, Asian, and Hispanic mothers and among mothers ≥25 years of age compared with their counterparts. We also observed higher effects of temperature on PPD among mothers exposed to higher air pollution or lower green space levels and among mothers with lower air conditioning penetration rates. CONCLUSION: Maternal exposure to higher temperature and diurnal temperature variability during the postpartum period was associated with an increased risk of PPD. Effect modification by maternal age, race/ethnicity, air pollution, green space, and air conditioning penetration was identified. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP14783.",10.1289/EHP14783,3,Scopus,85210922327,2-s2.0-85210922327,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210922327
"Artificial Intelligence in L2 learning: A meta-analysis of contextual, instructional, and social-emotional moderators",Wu X.Y.,2024,System,"This study conducts a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) interventions in language learning and to explore the moderating effects of various contextual, instructional, and social-emotional factors. By synthesizing data from 49 studies comprising 79 reports, the analysis reveals that AI interventions have a significant positive impact on language learning outcomes. The study identifies several key moderators influencing AI effectiveness, including the learning environment, intervention duration, educational level, participants’ age, sample size, language skills targeted, interactivity types, and feedback sources. The findings indicate that online and blended learning environments, medium-duration interventions (6 weeks–6 months), higher education settings, and young adult learners show the highest effectiveness. Additionally, AI interventions are most effective in enhancing listening and speaking skills, with significant benefits also observed for writing and vocabulary acquisition. Social-emotional factors such as motivation, anxiety reduction, and willingness to communicate are positively influenced by AI, though engagement and satisfaction exhibit variability. The study underscores the importance of personalized and adaptive AI tools, leveraging both automated and human feedback to maximize learning outcomes. These insights contribute to the growing body of literature on AI in education, offering guidance for optimizing AI-enhanced educational tools to support diverse learners effectively.

A hybrid approach of machine learning algorithms for improving accuracy of social media crisis detection,Pendhari A.,2024,International Journal of Hybrid Intelligent Systems,"The use of social media is becoming increasingly important in our day-to-day activities. Platforms for social media are utilised on a daily basis, and it has been seen that young adults make regular use of social media, even while they are in the midst of an emergency scenario. For the purpose of communication, individuals, businesses, and governments all make use of various social media platforms. Through their efforts to establish communication with their loved ones who are residing in regions that have been impacted by disasters, a great number of people are demonstrating their profound concern for the well-being of those individuals. The individuals are looking for a variety of necessities, including food, help, pharmaceuticals, lodging, transportation, and other necessities. It is possible for telecommunication networks to experience a breakdown or become incapable of adequately accommodating a sudden spike in the number of users attempting to connect to the network during times of crisis. There is a widespread use of short messaging service (SMS) mobile text messages in the modern communication landscape. Platforms for social media websites that are accessible online have the potential to effectively regulate the flow of communication. The existence of social media networks that are technologically scalable makes it possible for this to be a feasible option. The usage of a platform that enables communication in both directions has the potential to outperform the efficiency of conventional channels that only transmit information in one direction, such as radio and television, when it comes to crisis situations. The proliferation of network technologies has resulted in an increased emphasis on the examination of the features of network components, the mitigation of the affects of these components, and the rapid restoration of operations in the event of disasters. It is possible to improve the efficiency, dependability, and participatory nature of emergency communication by making use of various social media platforms.

"Gender-specific factors of suicidal ideation among high school students in Yunnan province, China: A machine learning approach",Li R.,2024,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Suicidal ideation (SI) assumes a pivotal role in predicting suicidal behaviors. The incidence of SI among high (junior and senior) school students is significantly higher than that of other age groups. The aim of this study is to explore the gender differences in SI among high school students in Yunnan Province. Method: A total of 6180 students in grades 7–12 in Yunnan province, China from May 2021 to May 2022 participated in this survey. Univariate analysis was employed to describe the influencing factors of male and female students' SI. Subsequently, data were stratified by gender.

Analysis and prediction of the usage of screen time to surmount COVID-19 using deep learning,Mohan A.,2024,Digital Analytics Applications for Sustainable Training and Education,"The tumultuous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still haunting the human race in every aspect of life. In the current scenario, from teenagers to adults, the majority of the time is spent online for most of the quotidian chores. Adapting to the change in lifestyle is also highly significant during the pandemic situation. An individual spends less time every day for self-orga¬nizing and self-care. As a result, this leads to the rise of various physical and mental ailments, especially depression for teenagers. In the past decade, the number of smart devices has become more ubiquitous, and the topic of screen time has come under increasing scrutiny. Though interacting with screens leads to innovative learning, it has also resulted in potential risks. Considering the pandemic situation and disruption in a healthy lifestyle, this research work aims to analyze and predict the screen time spent by teenagers. This is done using advanced deep learning techniques with an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model and machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression. The dataset comprises the screen time spent by teenagers across the world in with various field values like hourly basis, daily basis, monthly, and annually. It also comprises the screen time spent in the past six months during the pandemic. The output variable will be binary, and the model is trained using Regression techniques to predict the trend and is also tested to obtain the confusion matrix. The proposed technique is also predicted using Artificial Neural Networks. A comparative study of the results is done based on the accuracy of results procured from the Logistic Regression algorithm and neural network models. This significantly helps in drawing a conclu¬sion of which model gives accurate results. The proposed technique is also implemented using Neural Networks because they have the ability to procure a non-linear relationship between the several input features and the modeling strength. The result of the neural network model will also be hierarchical in nature. From the conclusion of this research work, one can self-introspect the amount of screen time spent in the current situation and a few years back. This will help us to organize our routine better such that a balance between real-life and digital life is ensured. The techniques proposed in this research work can further be extended to an organization or corporate world to predict the trend for managerial activities during this pandemic, which ensures a healthy work¬life balance. Hence, this would serve as a panacea to the rising problems like depression among teenagers, irregular routine, anxiety disorders, frequent headaches, and several other ailments caused due to an increase in screen time. The proposed technique would help to monitor and regulate oneself, enabling teenagers to involve in more physical activities.",,1,Scopus,85200861395,2-s2.0-85200861395,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200861395

Performance of Machine Learning Suicide Risk Models in an American Indian Population,Haroz E.E.,2024,JAMA Network Open,"Importance: Few suicide risk identification tools have been developed specifically for American Indian and Alaska Native populations, even though these populations face the starkest suicide-related inequities. Objective: To examine the accuracy of existing machine learning models in a majority American Indian population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used secondary data analysis of electronic health record data collected from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. Existing models from the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) and Vanderbilt University (VU) were fitted. Models were compared with an augmented screening indicator that included any previous attempt, recent suicidal ideation, or a recent positive suicide risk screen result. The comparison was based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The study was performed in partnership with a tribe and local Indian Health Service (IHS) in the Southwest. All patients were 18 years or older with at least 1 encounter with the IHS unit during the study period. Data were analyzed between October 6, 2022, and July 29, 2024. Exposures: Suicide attempts or deaths within 90 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: Model performance was compared based on the ability to distinguish between those with a suicide attempt or death within 90 days of their last IHS visit with those without this outcome. Results: Of 16835 patients (mean [SD] age, 40.0 [17.5] years; 8660 [51.4%] female; 14251 [84.7%] American Indian), 324 patients (1.9%) had at least 1 suicide attempt, and 37 patients (0.2%) died by suicide. The MHRN model had an AUROC value of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.85) for 90-day suicide attempts, whereas the VU model had an AUROC value of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.64-0.72), and the augmented screening indicator had an AUROC value of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.63-0.70). Calibration was poor for both models but improved after recalibration. Conclusion and Relevance: This prognostic study found that existing risk identification models for suicide prevention held promise when applied to new contexts and performed better than relying on a combined indictor of a positive suicide risk screen result, history of attempt, and recent suicidal ideation.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.39269,5,Scopus,85206277670,2-s2.0-85206277670,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206277670

"Obsessive-compulsive symptoms relating to psychosocial functioning for people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder",Grootendorst-Van Mil N.,2024,Acta Neuropsychiatrica,"To assess the psychosocial functioning concerning obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comorbidity in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder diagnosed in a large case register database in Southeast London. Data were retrieved from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM BRC) register using Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system, a platform allowing research on full but de-identified electronic health records for secondary and tertiary mental healthcare services. Information of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder diagnosis and OCS/OCD status was ascertained from structural or free-text fields through natural language processing (NLP) algorithms based on artificial intelligence techniques during the observation window of January 2007 to December 2016. Associations between comorbid OCS/OCD and recorded Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) for problems with activities of daily living (ADLs), living conditions, occupational and recreational activities, and relationships were estimated by logistic regression with socio-demographic confounders controlled. Of 15,412 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, 2,358 (15.3%) experienced OCS without OCD, and 2,586 (16.8%) had OCD recorded. The presence of OCS/OCD was associated with more problems with relationships (adj.OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.25-1.44), ADLs (adj.OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.22-1.41), and living conditions (adj.OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.22-1.41). Sensitivity analysis revealed similar outcomes. Comorbid OCS/OCD was associated with poorer psychosocial functioning in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.

MyListener: An AI-Mediated Journaling Mobile Application for Alleviating Depression and Loneliness Using Contextual Data,Jung G.,2024,Ubicomp Companion 2024 Companion of the 2024 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing,"Depression and loneliness are significant contributors to poor mental health and can potentially develop into severe mental disorders. With the advent of large language model (LLM) technology, healthcare applications aimed at improving mental health have become increasingly active, and AI-mediated journaling has garnered attention for its potential in mental health management. However, the impact of AI-mediated journaling on depression and loneliness remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce MyListener, an AI-mediated journaling mobile application that provides context-aware diary prompts and replies based on contextual data collected from the smartphone and the Fitbit Luxe smartband.

Leveraging LLMs to Predict Affective States via Smartphone Sensor Features,Zhang T.,2024,Ubicomp Companion 2024 Companion of the 2024 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing,"As mental health issues for young adults present a pressing public health concern, daily digital mood monitoring for early detection has become an important prospect. An active research area, digital phenotyping, involves collecting and analysing data from personal digital devices such as smartphones (usage and sensors) and wearables to infer behaviours and mental health. Whilst this data is standardly analysed using statistical and machine learning approaches, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a new approach to make sense of smartphone sensing data. Despite their effectiveness across various domains, LLMs remain relatively unexplored in digital mental health, particularly in integrating mobile sensor data. Our study aims to bridge this gap by employing LLMs to predict affect outcomes based on smartphone sensing data from university students. We demonstrate the efficacy of zero-shot and few-shot embedding LLMs in inferring general wellbeing. Our findings reveal that LLMs can make promising predictions of affect measures using solely smartphone sensing data. This research sheds light on the potential of LLMs for affective state prediction, emphasizing the intricate link between smartphone behavioral patterns and affective states. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage LLMs for affective state prediction and digital phenotyping tasks.",10.1145/3675094.3678420,3,Scopus,85206169944,2-s2.0-85206169944,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206169944
Edge Computing with Deep Learning and Internet of Things for Recognising and Predicting Students Emotions and Mental Health,Nowfal S.H.,2024,Journal of Machine and Computing,"A person's Mental Health (MH) dramatically influences their complete evolution in life, including their cognitive, emotional, and psychomotor components. A person with good MH is content with life and can be creative, learn new things, and take risks to accomplish more significant objectives. Currently, college students are dealing with MH concerns for various causes, which affect their academic performance and significantly contribute to poor academic results. Therefore, encouraging MH in college students presents a significant problem for educators, parents, teacher educators, and governments. Adolescence is a crucial and delicate time characterized by considerable physical, emotional, social, and religious changes. The physical, social, and psychological facets of an individual's growth are laid out in this period, with mental health as a crucial factor in promoting these gains. Therefore, it becomes crucial for researchers to use Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to study the association between MH and vital psychological characteristics, such as emotional intelligence, personality traits, and intelligence. The personal aspects, namely personality, emotional intelligence, and MH are all related ideas that influence one another. Individuals must have mental well-being and emotional harmony to have a good personality. The current study uses DL techniques to investigate the relationship between college students' MH, emotional intelligence, and personality features. To perform a thorough study on emotion identification and Mental Health Prediction (MHP) among college students, this project investigates the integration of edge computing enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) in the context of intelligent systems. Innovative treatments are urgently needed due to this population's rising prevalence of MH issues. This paper aims to continuously monitor and predict college students' MH using Edge Computing (EC) and IoT technology.",10.53759/7669/jmc202404101,0,Scopus,85207448890,2-s2.0-85207448890,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207448890
Causal effect of video gaming on mental well-being in Japan 2020–2022,Egami H.,2024,Nature Human Behaviour,"The widespread use of video games has raised concerns about their potential negative impact on mental well-being. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence supporting this notion is largely based on correlational studies, warranting further investigation into the causal relationship. Here we identify the causal effect of video gaming on mental well-being in Japan (2020–2022) using game console lotteries as a natural experiment. Employing approaches designed for causal inference on survey data (n = 97,602), we found that game console ownership, along with increased game play, improved mental well-being. The console ownership reduced psychological distress and improved life satisfaction by 0.1–0.6 standard deviations. Furthermore, a causal forest machine learning algorithm revealed divergent impacts between different types of console, with one showing smaller benefits for adolescents and females while the other showed larger benefits for adolescents. These findings highlight the complex impact of digital media on mental well-being and the importance of considering differential screen time effects.",10.1038/s41562-024-01948-y,8,Scopus,85201550548,2-s2.0-85201550548,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201550548
Dynamic and Transdiagnostic Risk Calculator Based on Natural Language Processing for the Prediction of Psychosis in Secondary Mental Health Care: Development and Internal-External Validation Cohort Study,Krakowski K.,2024,Biological Psychiatry,"Background: Automatic transdiagnostic risk calculators can improve the detection of individuals at risk of psychosis. However, they rely on assessment at a single point in time and can be refined with dynamic modeling techniques that account for changes in risk over time. Methods: We included 158,139 patients (5007 events) who received a first index diagnosis of a nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within electronic health records from the South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust between January 1, 2008, and October 8, 2021. A dynamic Cox landmark model was developed to estimate the 2-year risk of developing psychosis according to the TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariate prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis) statement. The dynamic model included 24 predictors extracted at 9 landmark points (baseline, 0, 6, 12, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 months): 3 demographic, 1 clinical, and 20 natural language processing–based symptom and substance use predictors. Performance was compared with a static Cox regression model with all predictors assessed at baseline only and indexed via discrimination (C-index), calibration (calibration plots), and potential clinical utility (decision curves) in internal-external validation. Results: The dynamic model improved discrimination performance from baseline compared with the static model (dynamic: C-index = 0.9; static: C-index = 0.87) and the final landmark point (dynamic: C-index = 0.79; static: C-index = 0.76). The dynamic model was also significantly better calibrated (calibration slope = 0.97–1.1) than the static model at later landmark points (≥24 months). Net benefit was higher for the dynamic than for the static model at later landmark points (≥24 months). Conclusions: These findings suggest that dynamic prediction models can improve the detection of individuals at risk for psychosis in secondary mental health care settings.",10.1016/j.biopsych.2024.05.022,4,Scopus,85199260042,2-s2.0-85199260042,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199260042
Validation of an abbreviated Big Five personality inventory at large population scale: Psychometric structure and associations with common psychiatric and neurological disorders,Kang W.,2024,Comprehensive Psychiatry,"Background: The five-factor model of personality, as quantified using instruments such as the Big Five Inventory, consists of broad personality domains including Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism (emotional instability), and Openness. Such instruments typically include >40 items. However, instruments with many items can be unwieldly and a cause of measurement error in clinical and cohort studies where multiple scales are sequenced. Conversely, established 5- and 10-item versions of the Big Five Inventory have poor reliability. Here, we developed and validated an abbreviated 18-item Big Five Inventory that balances efficiency, reliability and sensitivity. Method: We analysed three datasets (N = 59,797, N = 21,177, and N = 87,983) from individuals who participated in the online Great British Intelligence Test (GBIT) study, a collaborative citizen science project with BBC2 Horizon. We applied factor analyses (FA), predictive normative modelling, and one-sample t-tests to validate the 18-item version of the Big Five and to investigate its associations with psychiatric and neurological conditions. Results: The 18-item version of the Big Five Inventory had higher validity and retest reliability compared to the other previously shortened versions in the literature, with comparable demographic associations to the full Big Five Inventory. It exhibited strong (i.e. large effect size) associations with psychiatric conditions, and moderate (small-medium) associations with neurological conditions. Neuroticism (emotional instability) was substantially higher in all psychiatric conditions, whereas Conscientiousness, Openness and Extraversion showed differential associations across conditions. Conclusion: The newly validated 18-item version of the Big Five provides a convenient means of measuring personality traits that is suitable for deployment in a range of studies. It retains psychometric structure, retest reliability and clinical-group sensitivity, as compared to the full original scale.",10.1016/j.comppsych.2024.152514,10,Scopus,85197524260,2-s2.0-85197524260,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197524260
Using real-world electronic health record data to predict the development of 12 cancer-related symptoms in the context of multimorbidity,Bandyopadhyay A.,2024,JAMIA Open,"Objective: This study uses electronic health record (EHR) data to predict 12 common cancer symptoms, assessing the efficacy of machine learning (ML) models in identifying symptom influencers. Materials and Methods: We analyzed EHR data of 8156 adults diagnosed with cancer who underwent cancer treatment from 2017 to 2020. Structured and unstructured EHR data were sourced from the Enterprise Data Warehouse for Research at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. Several predictive models, including logistic regression, random forest (RF), and XGBoost, were employed to forecast symptom development. The performances of the models were evaluated by F1-score and area under the curve (AUC) on the testing set. The SHapley Additive exPlanations framework was used to interpret these models and identify the predictive risk factors associated with fatigue as an exemplar. Results: The RF model exhibited superior performance with a macro average AUC of 0.755 and an F1-score of 0.729 in predicting a range of cancer-related symptoms. For instance, the RF model achieved an AUC of 0.954 and an F1-score of 0.914 for pain prediction. Key predictive factors identified included clinical history, cancer characteristics, treatment modalities, and patient demographics depending on the symptom. For example, the odds ratio (OR) for fatigue was significantly influenced by allergy (OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.8-2.9) and colitis (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5-2.4). Discussion: Our research emphasizes the critical integration of multimorbidity and patient characteristics in modeling cancer symptoms, revealing the considerable influence of chronic conditions beyond cancer itself. Conclusion: We highlight the potential of ML for predicting cancer symptoms, suggesting a pathway for integrating such models into clinical systems to enhance personalized care and symptom management.",10.1093/jamiaopen/ooae082,8,Scopus,85204407380,2-s2.0-85204407380,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204407380
"Examining the Impact of Assistive Technology on Psychological Health, Family Education, and Curriculum Research in Japan: Insights from Artificial Intelligence",Guo Y.,2024,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,"This study aims to analyze the effect of psychological health based on artificial intelligence agent technology on the implementation effect of Japanese family education. By combining mobile agent technology and education thought, the system structure and working mechanism of the education support system of agents are studied to build personalized support for the family education system based on mobile agents. A total of 320 Japanese middle school students were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group, with 160 cases in each group. The control group received traditional family health education, while the experimental group received mental health education based on the Agent Technology family education system. The basic information and mental health scores of the two groups of students were compared. The results showed that there were no remarkable differences in the number of male and female cases, weight, height, average age, grade, home address, or family situation between groups (p > 0.05). The psychological health level of the experimental group was considerably superior to that of the control group regarding obsessional symptoms, interpersonal tension and sensitivity, depression, anxiety, learning pressure, maladaptation, emotional imbalance, and psychological imbalance (p < 0.05). In summary, compared with traditional family education, family education of the mental health education system based on agent technology can better improve the level of middle school students’ mental health, which can improve student forced symptoms, interpersonal tension and sensitivity, depression, anxiety, learning pressure, maladjustment, emotional imbalance, psychological imbalance, and many other psychological states.

A Mixed-Methods Study Exploring the Educational Experiences of Foster Youth and Foster Parents During COVID-19,Lee H.,2024,Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal,"The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to decrease the spread impacted youth in foster care and foster parents in a myriad of ways. One critical yet unexplored area is how educational changes during the first 2 years of the pandemic impacted this specific group of youth in foster care and foster parents. This exploratory study used three methods: (1) A scoping review of the prior research on pandemics/climate events and school closures and the research from early 2020; (2) individual interviews and focus groups with foster parents and teachers; and (3) an online survey of 88 foster parents. We endeavored to include findings at each stage of the process. Research from prior epidemics and school closures and predictive models predicted learning losses which were verified by the findings in the survey and interviews. Foster parents reported that the youth in foster care had great difficulty concentrating with on-line delivery and the absence or greatly limited access to mental health services compounded the challenges. Even as children returned to classrooms, the behavior of children, youth resulted in suspensions and expulsions likely increasing learning losses.

Predicting non-suicidal self-injury among Chinese adolescents: The application of ten algorithms of machine learning,Chen W.,2024,Heliyon,"Background and aims: High non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) prevalence among adolescents is a global health issue. However, current prediction models for adolescent NSSI rely on a limited set of algorithms, resulting in biased predictions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop multiple machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy and mitigate biases among Chinese adolescents. Methods: A total of 4487 junior and senior high school students in China were recruited. Multiple algorithms were included, such as logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, multi-layer perceptron, K-nearest neighbors, and ensemble learning algorithm like random forest, bagging, AdaBoost, and stacking to build predictive models. Data processing techniques, including standardization and the synthetic minority oversampling technique, were employed to optimize the predictive model. The model was trained on 70 % of the data, reserving 30 % for testing. Results: The ten prediction models achieved a good performance, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores above 0.700 in the test set. The stacking and random forest models achieved AUC scores of 0.904 and 0.898, respectively. The prediction performance of the Naive Bayes model was relatively poor. The top five important variables were resilience, bully, suicidal ideation, internet addiction, and depression. Conclusions: The ensemble machine learning algorithm showed promising results predicting NSSI among adolescents. Such algorithms should be recommended for future NSSI research to enhance predictive accuracy. Identification of important features in NSSI prediction can help develop screening protocols and lay a foundation for clinical diagnosis and intervention in adolescent populations.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e37723,4,Scopus,85204397754,2-s2.0-85204397754,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204397754
Integrating Psychological Principles and AI Technology into UX Design for Developing a Metaverse that Promotes Healthy Disconnection for Young Kids,Liu F.,2024,Proceedings Web3d 2024 29th International ACM Conference on 3D Web Technology,"The overuse of technology and extended time in 3D virtual worlds by young children and teenagers have raised concerns among parents and teachers about potential negative impacts on their psychological well-being and real-world engagement. This paper reviews earlier studies from educational and psychological perspectives and proposes using psychological principles as a crucial guide for user experience (UX) design in 3D virtual worlds, or the future metaverse. The goal is to create opportunities for healthy disconnection and encourage children to return to real-life activities. The paper also explores leveraging psychological insights and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in designing metaverse experiences. Such an approach allows UX designers and developers of 3D virtual environments to create functionalities that support disconnecting from the virtual realm. This helps mitigate the potential hazards of excessive virtual involvement and encourages a balanced integration of digital and offline pursuits. Such a virtual social environment could be seen as a responsible metaverse.",10.1145/3665318.3677165,0,Scopus,85211776898,2-s2.0-85211776898,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211776898
Machine learning identifies different related factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation in Chinese children and adolescents,Li Q.,2024,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Depression and suicidal ideation often co-occur in children and adolescents, yet they possess distinct characteristics. This study sought to identify the different related factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey collected data from Chinese children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 (N = 160,962; 48.91 % girls). The survey included inquiries about demographics, depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, perceived stress, academic burnout, internet addiction, non-suicidal self-injury, bullying, and being bullied. Fifteen machine learning algorithms were conducted to identify the different related factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation. Additionally, we conducted external validation on an independent sample of 1,812,889 children and adolescents. Results: Our findings revealed seven related factors linked to depression and six associated with suicidal ideation, with average accuracy rates of 86.86 % and 85.82 %, respectively. For depression, the most influential factors were anxiety, perceived stress, academic burnout, internet addiction, non-suicidal self-injury, experience of bullying, and age. Similarly, anxiety, non-suicidal self-injury, perceived stress, internet addiction, academic burnout, and age emerged as paramount factors for suicidal ideation. Moreover, these related factors showed notable variations in their predictive capacities for depression and suicidal ideation across different subgroups. Conclusion: Anxiety emerged as the predominant shared factor for both depression and suicidal ideation, whereas the other related factors displayed distinct predictive patterns for each condition. These findings highlight the critical need for tailored strategies from public mental health service providers and policymakers to address the pressing concerns of depression and suicidal ideation.",10.1016/j.jad.2024.06.006,5,Scopus,85195422219,2-s2.0-85195422219,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195422219
"What drives college students to use AI for L2 learning? Modeling the roles of self-efficacy, anxiety, and attitude based on an extended technology acceptance model",Chen D.,2024,Acta Psychologica,"Prior research highlights the critical role of AI in enhancing second language (L2) learning. However, the factors that practically affect L2 learners to engage with AI resources are still underexplored. Given the widespread availability of digital devices among college students, they are particularly poised to benefit from AI-assisted L2 learning. As such, this study, grounded in an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), investigates the predictors of college L2 learners' actual use of AI tools, focusing on AI self-efficacy, AI-related anxiety, and their overall attitude toward AI. Data was gathered from 429 L2 learners at Chinese universities via an online questionnaire, utilizing four established scales. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) via AMOS 24, the results indicate that AI self-efficacy could negatively affect AI anxiety, and positively influence both learners' attitude toward AI and their actual use of AI tools. Besides, AI anxiety negatively predicted the actual use of AI. Moreover, AI self-efficacy was a positive predictor of AI use through reducing AI anxiety, enhancing attitude toward AI, or a combination of both. This study also discusses the theoretical and pedagogical implications and suggests directions for future research.",10.1016/j.actpsy.2024.104442,53,Scopus,85200314622,2-s2.0-85200314622,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200314622
Estimating the prevalence of select noncommunicable diseases in Saudi Arabia using a population-based sample: econometric analysis with natural language processing,Alghnam S.,2024,Annals of Saudi Medicine,"BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major public health challenge globally, including in Saudi Arabia. However, measuring the true extent of NCD prevalence has been hampered by a paucity of nationally representative epidemiological studies. OBJECTIVES: Assess the prevalence of selected NCDs, using population-based electronic health records and applying novel analytical methods to identify cases of NCDs. DESIGN: Retrospective SETTINGS: A large healthcare network in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included all beneficiaries aged 16 years or older (n=650 835[a]) and used the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes, laboratory results, and associated medications to identify individuals with diabetes, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, mental disorders, and injuries. For diabetes and hypertension, we used natural language processing (NLP) on clinical notes in the electronic health records. The prevalence of multimorbidity across age groups was also tabulated, and logistic regression was used to examine its association with glycemic control. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and multimorbidity, and their association with glycemic control. SAMPLE Size: 650 835 individuals aged 16 years or older. RESULTS: The study population was relatively young, with 41.2% aged between 26 and 45 years, and around two-thirds were married. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 18.5% (95% CI: 18.5-18.7) and 13.0% (95% CI: 12.9-13.1), respectively. Approximately 26.7% (95% CI: 26.7-26.8) of the population had multimorbidity, with levels increasing to 62.9% for those aged 65 or older. Multimorbidity was associated with a four-fold increase in the likelihood of poor glycemic control. NLP analysis suggested that the prevalence of diabetes or hypertension may be underestimated by no more than 1.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a higher prevalence of NCDs than earlier national estimates. Electronic health records with regular analysis provide an opportunity to estimate changes in the prevalence of NCDs in Saudi Arabia. Health policies and interventions are needed to address the high levels of multimorbidity, which adversely impact glycemic control. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design and reliance on electronic health records, which may not capture all cases of NCDs.",10.5144/0256-4947.2024.329,1,Scopus,85205764946,2-s2.0-85205764946,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205764946
The role of psychotherapy apps during teaching solo vocals: The specifics of students' psychological preparation for performing in front of an audience,Wang N.,2024,Acta Psychologica,"This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a self-help application to reduce performance-related excitement in students of solo vocals in higher education institutions. The study participants (n = 219) used the mobile application during 6 weeks. Statistically significant effect of the intervention was achieved by Negative cognitions, Psychological vulnerability, and Anxiety perception constructs. The study also examines the influence of sociodemographic and personal characteristics on anxiety. Gender, graduate status, and self-efficacy were statistically significant variables when using the psychological self-help application. The investigation failed to disclose any significant impact of performance experience. Psychological self-help applications can be used in vocal/music education as a low-threshold intervention to reduce anxiety symptoms.

Three distinct patterns of mental health response following accidents in mountain sports: a follow-up study of individuals treated at a tertiary trauma center,Salvotti H.V.,2024,European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience,"The restorative effect of physical activity in alpine environments on mental and physical health is well recognized. However, a risk of accidents and post-accident mental health problems is inherent to every sport. We aimed to characterize mental health in individuals following mountain sport accidents requiring professional medical management. Adult victims of mountain sport accidents treated at the hospital of the Medical University of Innsbruck (Austria) between 2018 and 2020 completed a cross-sectional survey at least 6 months following the admission (median 44 months, n = 307). Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, PCL-5), anxiety, depression, and somatization (PHQ), resilience (RS-13), sense of coherence (SOC-9L), post-traumatic growth (PTGI), and quality of life (EUROHIS-QOL), as well as sociodemographic and clinical information, were obtained from an online survey and extracted from electronic health records. Mental health outcome patterns were investigated by semi-supervised medoid clustering and modeled by machine learning. Symptoms of PTSD were observed in 19% of participants. Three comparably sized subsets of participants were identified: a (1) neutral, (2) post-traumatic growth, and (3) post-traumatic stress cluster. The post-traumatic stress cluster was characterized by high prevalence of symptoms of mental disorders, low resilience, low sense of coherence, and low quality of life as well as by younger age, the highest frequency of pre-existing mental disorders, and persisting physical health consequences of the accident. Individuals in this cluster self-reported a need for psychological or psychiatric support following the accident and more cautious behavior during mountain sports since the accident. Reliability of machine learning-based prediction of the cluster assignment based on 40 variables available during acute medical treatment of accident victims was limited. A subset of individuals show symptoms of mental health disorders including symptoms of PTSD when assessed at least 6 months after mountain sport accident. Since early identification of these vulnerable patients remains challenging, psychoeducational measures for all patients and low-threshold access to mental health support are key for a successful interdisciplinary management of victims of mountain sport accidents.",10.1007/s00406-024-01807-x,3,Scopus,85192759096,2-s2.0-85192759096,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192759096
"The influence of enjoyment, boredom, and burnout on EFL achievement: Based on latent moderated structural equation modeling",Zhou M.,2024,Plos One,"In recent years, the boom in the field of positive psychology in second language acquisition research has seen an increasing number of scholars focusing on the individual well-being of second language learners alongside their learning effectiveness. Despite this growing interest, there is a need to further investigate the specific emotional factors influencing academic achievement in foreign language learning. This study investigates the impact of three emotions—enjoyment, boredom, and burnout—on academic achievement, and the moderating role of academic buoyancy. Data were collected from 563 college English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) students from China’s mainland using latent moderated structural equation modeling with Mplus. The results of the latent bivariate correlation analysis showed significant correlations between EFL learning emotions, academic buoyancy, and test performance. In the latent moderated structural equations model, enjoyment and burnout predicted test performance. Moreover, academic buoyancy moderated the relationships between enjoyment and test performance, and between burnout and test performance. EFL test performance was highest when enjoyment and buoyancy were both high, or when burnout and buoyancy were both low. These findings highlight the importance of fostering positive emotions and resilience in language learners to enhance their academic performance, offering valuable insights for educators and policymakers aiming to improve foreign language education.",10.1371/journal.pone.0310281,5,Scopus,85204074993,2-s2.0-85204074993,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204074993
The identity group as a source of social influence for individuals with concealable stigmatized identities,Cortopassi A.C.,2024,Plos One,"Many people who are stigmatized along concealable features (e.g., sexual minorities or people with mental illness) anticipate social rejection due to their features and associated labels, and these beliefs are a prominent predictor of psychological distress. While ecological approaches to stigma research have highlighted the social basis of these two related outcomes, it typically has focused on the impact of non-stigmatized counterparts. Also embedded in the social environment are similarly-stigmatized others who, in concealing, may be less accessible to the individual. Given the centrality of psychological distress and rejection concerns as a relational self-conception in attachment theories, we tested if identity-based rejection sensitivity and distress may emerge from diminished access to similarly-stigmatized others as identity group members. Leveraging the University as a partially-controlled, naturalistic setting, we collected measures of concealment, identity-based rejection sensitivity, and psychological distress from undergraduate students in introductory psychology courses who reported a concealable stigmatized identity (N = 355; k = 15 identity groups). With concealment aggregated to the level of the identity group, multi-level modeling showed that concealment by similarly-stigmatized students was positively associated with both individuals’ identity-based rejection sensitivity and their psychological distress. Moreover, rejection sensitivity mediated the association of group-level concealment and distress. Findings suggest that rejection concerns and distress may emerge from identity group inaccessibility in the social environment, with the association of concerns and distress possibly contextualized by underlying group attachment dynamics. Results reveal the identity group as a novel source of social influence in the lives of individuals with concealable stigmatized identities.",10.1371/journal.pone.0309687,1,Scopus,85203582428,2-s2.0-85203582428,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203582428
Fear of Hypoglycemia and Diabetes Distress: Expected Reduction by Glucose Prediction,Ehrmann D.,2024,Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology,"Background: Extended glucose predictions are novel in diabetes management. Currently, there is no solution widely available. People with diabetes mellitus (DM) are offered features like trend arrows and limited predictions linked to predefined situations. Thus, the impact of extended glucose predictions on the burden of diabetes and person-reported outcomes (PROs) is unclear. Methods: In this online survey, 206 people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), 70.9% and 29.1%, respectively, who participated in the dia·link online panel and were current continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) users, were presented with different scenarios of hypothetical extended glucose predictions. They were asked to imagine how low glucose predictions of 30 minutes and overnight as well as glucose predictions up to 2 hours would influence their diabetes management. Subsequently, they completed the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey II (HFS-II) and the T1 Diabetes Distress Scale (T1-DDS) by rating each item on a 5-point scale (−2: strong deterioration to +2: strong improvement) according to the potential change due to using glucose predictions. Results: For all glucose prediction periods, 30 minutes, up to 2 hours, and at nighttime, the surveyed participants expected moderate improvements in both fear of hypoglycemia (HFS-II: 0.57 ± 0.49) and overall diabetes distress (T1-DDS = 0.44 ± 0.49). The T1-DDS did not differ for type of therapy or diabetes. Conclusions: People with T1D and T2D would see glucose predictions as a potential improvement regarding reduced fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes distress. Therefore, glucose predictions represent a value for them in lowering the burden of diabetes and its management.",10.1177/19322968241267886,9,Scopus,85201565315,2-s2.0-85201565315,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201565315
Preoperative Mobile Health Data Improve Predictions of Recovery from Lumbar Spine Surgery,Greenberg J.K.,2024,Neurosurgery,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neurosurgeons and hospitals devote tremendous resources to improving recovery from lumbar spine surgery. Current efforts to predict surgical recovery rely on one-time patient report and health record information. However, longitudinal mobile health (mHealth) assessments integrating symptom dynamics from ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and wearable biometric data may capture important influences on recovery. Our objective was to evaluate whether a preoperative mHealth assessment integrating EMA with Fitbit monitoring improved predictions of spine surgery recovery. METHODS: Patients age 21-85 years undergoing lumbar surgery for degenerative disease between 2021 and 2023 were recruited. For up to 3 weeks preoperatively, participants completed EMAs up to 5 times daily asking about momentary pain, disability, depression, and catastrophizing. At the same time, they were passively monitored using Fitbit trackers. Study outcomes were good/excellent recovery on the Quality of Recovery-15 (QOR-15) and a clinically important change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference 1 month postoperatively. After feature engineering, several machine learning prediction models were tested. Prediction performance was measured using the c-statistic. RESULTS: A total of 133 participants were included, with a median (IQR) age of 62 (53, 68) years, and 56% were female. The median (IQR) number of preoperative EMAs completed was 78 (61, 95), and the median (IQR) number of days with usable Fitbit data was 17 (12, 21). 63 patients (48%) achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System pain interference. Compared with traditional evaluations alone, mHealth evaluations led to a 34% improvement in predictions for pain interference (c = 0.82 vs c = 0.61). 49 patients (40%) had a good or excellent recovery based on the QOR-15. Including preoperative mHealth data led to a 30% improvement in predictions of QOR-15 (c = 0.70 vs c = 0.54). CONCLUSION: Multimodal mHealth evaluations improve predictions of lumbar surgery outcomes. These methods may be useful for informing patient selection and perioperative recovery strategies.",10.1227/neu.0000000000002911,18,Scopus,85193546702,2-s2.0-85193546702,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193546702
Which patients are at risk of developing symptom diagnoses that persist for more than a year in primary care? Development and external validation of a prediction model,Chaabouni A.,2024,Journal of Psychosomatic Research,"Objectives: To train, test and externally validate a prediction model that supports General Practitioners (GPs) in early identification of patients at risk of developing symptom diagnoses that persist for more than a year. Methods: We retrospectively collected and selected all patients having episodes of symptom diagnoses during the period 2008 and 2021 from the Family Medicine Network (FaMe-Net) database. From this group, we identified symptom diagnoses that last for less than a year and symptom diagnoses that persist for more than a year. Multivariable logistic regression analysis using a backward selection was used to assess which factors were most predictive for developing symptom diagnoses that persist for more than a year. Performance of the model was assessed using calibration and discrimination (AUC) measures. External validation was tested using data between 2018 and 2022 from AHON-registry, a primary care electronic health records data registry including 73 general practices from the north and east regions of the Netherlands and about 460, 795 patients. Results: From the included 47,870 patients with a symptom diagnosis in the FaMe-Net registry, 12,481 (26.1%) had a symptom diagnosis that persisted for more than a year. Older age (≥ 75 years: OR = 1.30, 95% CI [1.19, 1.42]), having more previous symptom diagnoses (≥ 3: 1.11, [1.05, 1.17]) and more contacts with the GP over the last 2 years (≥ 10 contacts: 5.32, [4.80, 5.89]) were predictive of symptom diagnoses that persist for more than a year with a marginally acceptable discrimination (AUC 0.70, 95% CI [0.69–0.70]). The external validation showed poor performance with an AUC of 0.64 ([0.63–0.64]). Conclusion: A clinical prediction model based on age, number of previous symptom diagnoses and contacts might help the GP to early identify patients developing symptom diagnoses that persist for more than a year. However, the performance of the original model is limited. Hence, the model is not yet ready for a large-scale implementation.",10.1016/j.jpsychores.2024.111859,0,Scopus,85199308584,2-s2.0-85199308584,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199308584
Implementing And Analyzing The Advantages Of Voice Ai As Measurement-Based Care To Address Behavioral Health Treatment Disparities Among Youth In Economically Disadvantaged Communities,Alemu Y.,2024,Telehealth and Medicine Today,"Objectives: This study evaluates one aspect of the TQIntelligence (TQI) Measurement-Based Care (MBC). Once fully developed and validated, the platform is intended to quantify the level of emotional distress using voice artificial intelligence and track treatment outcomes in children and adolescents from low-income communities. The focus here is on non-voice data collected and evaluated as part of developing a voice-based machine learning model. In addition, this article explores the benefits and challenges of implementing such MBC systems in community behavioral health settings that serve low-income communities. Methods: Researchers collected data from a large community sample of children and adolescent patients receiving mental health and family preservation services. The TQI worked with three community behavioral health agencies in the Southeastern United States. While patients were in treatment, researchers collected data from electronic medical records, including diagnosis and treatment history. Multiple therapists in this pilot study collected psychiatric screening data using the Symptoms and Functioning Severity Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and The Adverse Childhood Experiences survey to screen for depressive disorders and trauma exposure. The therapist also collected a 15–45-second voice sample from pediatric patients at the beginning of the session. Results: The results show that TQI’s MBC, like other MBC systems, demonstrated significant benefits, including detecting improvement in psychiatric symptom severity for children and adolescents who have received consistent services. The data indicate that providing consistent data-driven services contributes to care, which results in a substantial decrease in psychiatric symptoms, particularly between sessions 15 and 20, and remission of psychiatric symptoms with no indication of relapse between sessions 20 and 40 in a significant proportion of patients. Conclusions: The application of long-term treatment and TQI’s data-driven system shows benefits, such as the reduction and remission of psychiatric symptoms in children and adolescent populations. This study contributes to the literature as it clearly demonstrates support for investment in and the application of digital mental health systems to detect and quantify emotional distress. It demonstrates that these systems effectively inform a larger strategy to address a long history of inequity in treatment outcomes for youth from marginalized communities.",10.30953/thmt.v9.506,0,Scopus,85203366608,2-s2.0-85203366608,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203366608
Use of smartphone sensor data in detecting and predicting depression and anxiety in young people (12–25 years): A scoping review,Beames J.R.,2024,Heliyon,"Digital phenotyping is a promising method for advancing scalable detection and prediction methods in mental health research and practice. However, little is known about how digital phenotyping data are used to make inferences about youth mental health. We conducted a scoping review of 35 studies to better understand how passive sensing (e.g., Global Positioning System, microphone etc) and electronic usage data (e.g., social media use, device activity etc) collected via smartphones are used in detecting and predicting depression and/or anxiety in young people between 12 and 25 years-of-age. GPS and/or Wifi association logs and accelerometers were the most used sensors, although a wide variety of low-level features were extracted and computed (e.g., transition frequency, time spent in specific locations, uniformity of movement). Mobility and sociability patterns were explored in more studies compared to other behaviours such as sleep, phone use, and circadian movement. Studies used machine learning, statistical regression, and correlation analyses to examine relationships between variables. Results were mixed, but machine learning indicated that models using feature combinations (e.g., mobility, sociability, and sleep features) were better able to predict and detect symptoms of youth anxiety and/or depression when compared to models using single features (e.g., transition frequency). There was inconsistent reporting of age, gender, attrition, and phone characteristics (e.g., operating system, models), and all studies were assessed to have moderate to high risk of bias. To increase translation potential for clinical practice, we recommend the development of a standardised reporting framework to improve transparency and replicability of methodology.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35472,8,Scopus,85200120976,2-s2.0-85200120976,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200120976
Responding to the Heat and Planning for the Future: An Interview-Based Inquiry of People with Schizophrenia Who Experienced the 2021 Heat Dome in Canada,Yoon L.,2024,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"People with schizophrenia have died at disproportionately higher rates during recent extreme heat events (EHEs) in Canada, including the deadly 2021 Heat Dome in British Columbia (B.C.). However, to date, little research has qualitatively focused on how people with schizophrenia experience and respond to EHEs. This study aimed to (i) explore how people with schizophrenia experienced and were impacted by the 2021 Heat Dome physically, cognitively, and emotionally and (ii) understand their level of awareness and health-protective actions taken in response to the EHE. Between October 2023 and February 2024, interviews were conducted with 35 people with schizophrenia who experienced the 2021 Heat Dome in a community setting within B.C., Canada. The semi-structured interviews were guided by pre-defined questions to explore the participant’s background, living situation, social network, awareness and access to heat-mitigation measures. The transcripts were analyzed using a descriptive form of thematic analysis. Participants shared critical insights on how the EHE impacted them, including descriptions of mild to severe physical manifestations of heat stress (e.g., fainting, heat rashes), the triggering of schizophrenia-related symptoms (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations), and the detrimental effects on their energy levels and emotional stability, which further caused disruptions to their everyday life. Participants also illustrated gaps in knowledge and challenges experienced with accessing information, which hindered their ability to manage the heat exposure effectively and, for some, resulted in no actions (or counter-intuitive actions) being taken to mitigate the heat. These findings demonstrate the complex ways that individuals with schizophrenia experienced and responded to the 2021 Heat Dome and revealed various situational and contextual factors that further compounded the challenge of heat mitigation. These findings can support the development of tailored individual and community-level heat response and communication initiatives and strategies for people with schizophrenia.",10.3390/ijerph21081108,5,Scopus,85202619112,2-s2.0-85202619112,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202619112
Enhancing sleep health in urban American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents: Implications for culturally tailored interventions,Dong L.,2024,Journal of Adolescence,"Background: Urban American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adolescents are vulnerable to sleep and other health-related disparities due to numerous social drivers, including historical trauma and relocation to urban areas. This study aims to identify strategies to increase protective factors and culturally tailor sleep health interventions for this population. Methods: Using community-based participatory research, the NAYSHAW study conducted in-depth interviews with urban AI/AN adolescents aged 12–19 years to understand critical components needed for developing a culturally sensitive sleep health intervention. Data from two qualitative subsamples (N = 46) and parent surveys (N = 110) were analyzed, focusing on factors that affect sleep health behaviors, including parental involvement, technology, and traditional practices. Results: Key findings include the detrimental impact of electronics use at night and protective effects of traditional practices on sleep. Parental involvement in sleep routines varied by adolescent's age. Adolescents desired sleep health education in interactive formats, whereas parents preferred workshops and digital applications for sleep health strategies. Findings suggest that interventions need to address electronics use and should also be culturally tailored to address the unique experiences of urban AI/AN adolescents. Conclusions: Results underscore the importance of utilizing community-based strategies to develop culturally tailored sleep interventions for underserved populations, specifically urban AI/AN adolescents. Integrating traditional practices with evidence-based sleep health strategies can provide a holistic approach to improving sleep and overall well-being. Parental education and involvement will be critical to the success of such interventions.",10.1002/jad.12350,1,Scopus,85193533095,2-s2.0-85193533095,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193533095
Evaluation of a digital tool for detecting stress and craving in SUD recovery: An observational trial of accuracy and engagement,Carreiro S.,2024,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,"Background: Digital health interventions offer opportunities to expand access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, collect objective real-time data, and deliver just-in-time interventions: however implementation has been limited. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) Health is a digital tool which uses continuous physiologic data to detect high risk behavioral states (stress and craving) during SUD recovery. Methods: This was an observational study to evaluate the digital stress and craving detection during outpatient SUD treatment. Participants were asked to use the RAE Health app, wear a commercial-grade wrist sensor over a 30-day period. They were asked to self-report stress and craving, at which time were offered brief in-app de-escalation tools. Supervised machine learning algorithms were applied retrospectively to wearable sensor data obtained to develop group-based digital biomarkers for stress and craving. Engagement was assessed by number of days of utilization, and number of hours in a given day of connection. Results: Sixty percent of participants (N=30) completed the 30-day protocol. The model detected stress and craving correctly 76 % and 69 % of the time, respectively, but with false positive rates of 33 % and 28 % respectively. All models performed close to previously validated models from a research grade sensor. Participants used the app for a mean of 14.2 days (SD 10.1) and 11.7 h per day (SD 8.2). Anxiety disorders were associated with higher mean hours per day connected, and return to drug use events were associated with lower mean hours per day connected. Conclusions: Future work should explore the effect of similar digital health systems on treatment outcomes and the optimal dose of digital interventions needed to make a clinically significant impact.",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2024.111353,5,Scopus,85196754991,2-s2.0-85196754991,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196754991
Novel Machine Learning Identifies 5 Asthma Phenotypes Using Cluster Analysis of Real-World Data,Wu C.P.,2024,Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in Practice,"Background: Asthma classification into different subphenotypes is important to guide personalized therapy and improve outcomes. Objectives: To further explore asthma heterogeneity through determination of multiple patient groups by using novel machine learning (ML) approaches and large-scale real-world data. Methods: We used electronic health records of patients with asthma followed at the Cleveland Clinic between 2010 and 2021. We used k-prototype unsupervised ML to develop a clustering model where predictors were age, sex, race, body mass index, prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry measurements, and the usage of inhaled/systemic steroids. We applied elbow and silhouette plots to select the optimal number of clusters. These clusters were then evaluated through LightGBM's supervised ML approach on their cross-validated F1 score to support their distinctiveness. Results: Data from 13,498 patients with asthma with available postbronchodilator spirometry measurements were extracted to identify 5 stable clusters. Cluster 1 included a young nonsevere asthma population with normal lung function and higher frequency of acute exacerbation (0.8 /patient-year). Cluster 2 had the highest body mass index (mean ± SD, 44.44 ± 7.83 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and the highest proportion of females (77.5%) and Blacks (28.9%). Cluster 3 comprised patients with normal lung function. Cluster 4 included patients with lower percent of predicted FEV<inf>1</inf> of 77.03 (12.79) and poor response to bronchodilators. Cluster 5 had the lowest percent of predicted FEV<inf>1</inf> of 68.08 (15.02), the highest postbronchodilator reversibility, and the highest proportion of severe asthma (44.9%) and blood eosinophilia (>300 cells/μL) (34.8%). Conclusions: Using real-world data and unsupervised ML, we classified asthma into 5 clinically important subphenotypes where group-specific asthma treatment and management strategies can be designed and deployed.",10.1016/j.jaip.2024.04.035,13,Scopus,85194061858,2-s2.0-85194061858,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194061858
A review of information sources and analysis methods for data driven decision aids in child and adolescent mental health services,Koochakpour K.,2024,International Journal of Medical Informatics,"Objective: Clinical data analysis relies on effective methods and appropriate data. Recognizing distinctive clinical services and service functions may lead to improved decision-making. Our first objective is to categorize analytical methods, data sources, and algorithms used in current research on information analysis and decision support in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Our secondary objective is to identify the potential for data analysis in different clinical services and functions in which data-driven decision aids can be useful. Materials and methods: We searched related studies in Science Direct and PubMed from 2018 to 2023(Jun), and also in ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, DBLP (Database systems and Logic Programming), and Google Scholar from 2018 to 2021. We have reviewed 39 studies and extracted types of analytical methods, information content, and information sources for decision-making. Results: In order to compare studies, we developed a framework for characterizing health services, functions, and data features. Most data sets in reviewed studies were small, with a median of 1,550 patients and 46,503 record entries. Structured data was used for all studies except two that used textual clinical notes. Most studies used supervised classification and regression. Service and situation-specific data analysis dominated among the studies, only two studies used temporal, or process features from the patient data. This paper presents and summarizes the utility, but not quality, of the studies according to the care situations and care providers to identify service functions where data-driven decision aids may be relevant. Conclusions: Frameworks identifying services, functions, and care processes are necessary for characterizing and comparing electronic health record (EHR) data analysis studies. The majority of studies use features related to diagnosis and assessment and correspondingly have utility for intervention planning and follow-up.

Analysis and classification of EEG data when playing video games and relax using EEG biomarkers,Rajendran V.G.,2024,Aip Conference Proceedings,"These days, video games are a common kind of amusement used by children. Different video games are available with various online/offline smartphone apps. Adolescent groups spend more time playing games using smartphones, which will lead to various health hazards such as obesity, visual problems, musculoskeletal problems, stress and depression, sleep deprivation, etc. The main objective of this paper is to analyze and classify the cognitive stress detection in students while playing video games and relax EEG data. The raw EEG data were collected from ten subjects under relaxation and during the playing of video games by using a 14-channel Emotiv Epocx device. The raw EEG data was preprocessed and decomposed into various frequency bands such as alpha, beta and theta bands using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). EEG relative band energies were computed, and band ratios were extracted using Matlab. The above-extracted features were normalized and fed to various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision tree, KNN, Ensemble and neural networks. The classification accuracy is 68.3% for the ensemble classifier by taking relative band energies of alpha, beta and theta as the features.

Cyberbullying Detection on Twitter Using Machine Learning Algorithms,Chaitanya A.N.V.,2024,Aip Conference Proceedings,"Cyberbullying is a major social problem that has been affecting people across the globe. With the rise of social media platforms, cyberbullying has become even more prevalent, making it necessary to develop tools that can effectivelydetect cyberbullying and prevent its negative impact on individuals and society. Cyberbullying victims are known to become dangerously afraid as a result, and they may even have suicide or violent retaliation ideas. They experience anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Because it occurs,”behind the scenes” and”24/7” cyberbullying is worse than physical bullying. Bullying tweets or comments persist for a long time and continue to affect the victim's mental health negatively. It resembles ragging in many ways, with the exception that it takes place in front of thousands of shared friends and that the wounds endure as long as the online messages do. The humiliating and upsetting text causes the victims unimaginable amounts of embarrassment. The effects are significant and even worse. Nine out of ten times, or in the majority of cases, teenage victims do not tell their guardians or parents out of embarrassment and go into despair or,in the worst circumstances, commit suicide. To precisely identify cyberbullying in tweets, we have applied several machines learning techniques, including multinomial NB, SVM, logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and SGD classifier. By utilizing these algorithms, we have been able to identify cyberbullying with a high degree of accuracy, allowing us to stop it in its tracks and lessen its damaging effects. Furthermore, we have also developed a web application that allows users to check whether a tweet is cyberbullying or not and it also tells which category the tweet falls under like religion, gender, ethnicity, and age. The web application provides a simple and user-friendly interface thatallows users to easily check whether their tweets are considered cyberbullying or not. Overall, this research paper presents a comprehensive approach to detecting cyberbullying on Twitter using machine learning techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in detecting cyberbullying and highlight the potential of these techniques for preventing the negative impact of cyberbullying on individuals and society.",10.1063/5.0217132,0,Scopus,85200771639,2-s2.0-85200771639,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200771639

Validation of a Multivariable Model to Predict Suicide Attempt in a Mental Health Intake Sample,Papini S.,2024,JAMA Psychiatry,"Importance: Given that suicide rates have been increasing over the past decade and the demand for mental health care is at an all-time high, targeted prevention efforts are needed to identify individuals seeking to initiate mental health outpatient services who are at high risk for suicide. Suicide prediction models have been developed using outpatient mental health encounters, but their performance among intake appointments has not been directly examined. Objective: To assess the performance of a predictive model of suicide attempts among individuals seeking to initiate an episode of outpatient mental health care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study tested the performance of a previously developed machine learning model designed to predict suicide attempts within 90 days of any mental health outpatient visit. All mental health intake appointments scheduled between January 1, 2012, and April 1, 2022, at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system serving over 4.5 million patients, were included. Data were extracted and analyzed from August 9, 2022, to July 31, 2023. Main Outcome and Measures: Suicide attempts (including completed suicides) within 90 days of the appointment, determined by diagnostic codes and government databases. All predictors were extracted from electronic health records. Results: The study included 1623232 scheduled appointments from 835616 unique patients. There were 2800 scheduled appointments (0.17%) followed by a suicide attempt within 90 days. The mean (SD) age across appointments was 39.7 (15.8) years, and most appointments were for women (1103184 [68.0%]). The model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.76-0.78), an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.02 (95% CI, 0.02-0.02), an expected calibration error of 0.0012 (95% CI, 0.0011-0.0013), and sensitivities of 37.2% (95% CI, 35.5%-38.9%) and 18.8% (95% CI, 17.3%-20.2%) at specificities of 95% and 99%, respectively. The 10% of appointments at the highest risk level accounted for 48.8% (95% CI, 47.0%-50.6%) of the appointments followed by a suicide attempt. Conclusions and Relevance: In this prognostic study involving mental health intakes, a previously developed machine learning model of suicide attempts showed good overall classification performance. Implementation research is needed to determine appropriate thresholds and interventions for applying the model in an intake setting to target high-risk cases in a manner that is acceptable to patients and clinicians.",10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2024.0189,6,Scopus,85189660327,2-s2.0-85189660327,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189660327

"Predicting Mood Based on the Social Context Measured Through the Experience Sampling Method, Digital Phenotyping, and Social Networks",Langener A.M.,2024,Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research,"Social interactions are essential for well-being. Therefore, researchers increasingly attempt to capture an individual's social context to predict well-being, including mood. Different tools are used to measure various aspects of the social context. Digital phenotyping is a commonly used technology to assess a person's social behavior objectively. The experience sampling method (ESM) can capture the subjective perception of specific interactions. Lastly, egocentric networks are often used to measure specific relationship characteristics. These different methods capture different aspects of the social context over different time scales that are related to well-being, and combining them may be necessary to improve the prediction of well-being. Yet, they have rarely been combined in previous research. To address this gap, our study investigates the predictive accuracy of mood based on the social context. We collected intensive within-person data from multiple passive and self-report sources over a 28–day period in a student sample (Participants: N = 11, ESM measures: N = 1313). We trained individualized random forest machine learning models, using different predictors included in each model summarized over different time scales. Our findings revealed that even when combining social interactions data using different methods, predictive accuracy of mood remained low. The average coefficient of determination over all participants was 0.06 for positive and negative affect and ranged from − 0.08 to 0.3, indicating a large amount of variance across people. Furthermore, the optimal set of predictors varied across participants; however, predicting mood using all predictors generally yielded the best predictions. While combining different predictors improved predictive accuracy of mood for most participants, our study highlights the need for further work using larger and more diverse samples to enhance the clinical utility of these predictive modeling approaches.",10.1007/s10488-023-01328-0,5,Scopus,85182211036,2-s2.0-85182211036,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182211036
Rates and correlates of study enrolment and use of a chatbot aimed to promote mental health services use for eating disorders following online screening,D’Adamo L.,2024,European Eating Disorders Review,"Objective: We developed a chatbot aimed to facilitate mental health services use for eating disorders (EDs) and offered the opportunity to enrol in a research study and use the chatbot to all adult respondents to a publicly available online ED screen who screened positive for clinical/subclinical EDs and reported not currently being in treatment. We examined the rates and correlates of enrolment in the study and uptake of the chatbot. Method: Following screening, eligible respondents (≥18 years, screened positive for a clinical/subclinical ED, not in treatment for an ED) were shown the study opportunity. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions explored differences in demographics, ED symptoms, suicidality, weight, and probable ED diagnoses between those who enroled and engaged with the chatbot versus those who did not. Results: 6747 respondents were shown the opportunity (80.0% of all adult screens). 3.0% enroled, of whom 90.2% subsequently used the chatbot. Enrolment and chatbot uptake were more common among respondents aged ≥25 years old versus those aged 18–24 and less common among respondents who reported engaging in regular dietary restriction. Conclusions: Overall enrolment was low, yet uptake was high among those that enroled and did not differ across most demographics and symptom presentations.

Inpatient Care Utilization Following Mobile Crisis Response Encounters Among Racial/Ethnic Minoritized Youth,Lui J.H.L.,2024,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Objective: There has been an increase in youth psychiatric emergencies and psychiatric inpatient hospitalizations in recent years. Mobile crisis response (MCR) services offer an opportunity to meet acute youth mental health needs in the community and to provide linkage to care. However, an understanding of MCR encounters as a care pathway is needed, including how patterns of subsequent care may vary by youth race/ethnicity. The current study examines racial/ethnic differences in the rates of inpatient care use following MCR among youth. Method: Data included Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health (LACDMH) administrative claims for MCR in 2017 and psychiatric inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient services from 2017-2020 for youth aged 0 to 18 years. Results: In this sample of 6,908 youth (70.4% racial/ethnic minoritized youth) who received an MCR, 3.2% received inpatient care within 30 days of their MCR, 18.6% received inpatient care beyond 30 days of their MCR, and 14.7% received repeated inpatient care episodes during the study period. Multivariate models revealed that Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) youth were less likely to receive inpatient care, whereas American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth were more likely to receive inpatient care following MCR. Youth age, primary language, primary diagnosis, and insurance status also predicted future inpatient episodes. Conclusion: Findings highlight differential rates of inpatient use following MCR among AAPI and AI/AN youth relative to youth from other groups. Alternative interpretations for the findings are offered related to differential levels of need and disparate penetration of community-based outpatient and prevention-focused services. Plain language summary: The study investigates racial and ethnic differences in the rates of inpatient care receipt after youth experience a psychiatric emergency in Los Angeles County. A total of 6,908 youth received mobile crisis response services and participated in the study. No racial/ethnic differences emerged in inpatient care use within the first month of receiving mobile crisis response services, but in the longer-term, Asian American/Pacific Islander youth were the least likely to receive inpatient care, and American Indian/Alaska Native youth were the most likely to receive inpatient. No differences in inpatient care use were observed for Black and Latinx youth relative to other youth in the study. Given the high costs for inpatient care, it remains critical to connect high-risk minoritized youth to less costly community-based care.",10.1016/j.jaac.2023.06.021,3,Scopus,85167778665,2-s2.0-85167778665,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167778665
Comparing natural language processing representations of coded disease sequences for prediction in electronic health records,Beaney T.,2024,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,"Objective: Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms are increasingly being applied to obtain unsupervised representations of electronic health record (EHR) data, but their comparative performance at predicting clinical endpoints remains unclear. Our objective was to compare the performance of unsupervised representations of sequences of disease codes generated by bag-of-words versus sequence-based NLP algorithms at predicting clinically relevant outcomes. Materials and Methods: This cohort study used primary care EHRs from 6 286 233 people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions in England. For each patient, an unsupervised vector representation of their time-ordered sequences of diseases was generated using 2 input strategies (212 disease categories versus 9462 diagnostic codes) and different NLP algorithms (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, doc2vec, and 2 transformer models designed for EHRs). We also developed a transformer architecture, named EHR-BERT, incorporating sociodemographic information. We compared the performance of each of these representations (without fine-tuning) as inputs into a logistic classifier to predict 1-year mortality, healthcare use, and new disease diagnosis. Results: Patient representations generated by sequence-based algorithms performed consistently better than bag-of-words methods in predicting clinical endpoints, with the highest performance for EHR-BERT across all tasks, although the absolute improvement was small. Representations generated using disease categories perform similarly to those using diagnostic codes as inputs, suggesting models can equally manage smaller or larger vocabularies for prediction of these outcomes. Discussion and Conclusion: Patient representations produced by sequence-based NLP algorithms from sequences of disease codes demonstrate improved predictive content for patient outcomes compared with representations generated by co-occurrence-based algorithms.

As the need to engage youth comfortable with texting increases, mental health providers are exploring and adopting text-based media such as chatbots, community-based forums, online therapies with licensed professionals, and helplines operated by trained responders. To support these text-based media for mental health-particularly for crisis care-we are developing a system to perform passive emotion-sensing using a combination of keystroke dynamics and sentiment analysis. Our early studies of this system posit that the analysis of short text messages and keyboard typing patterns can provide emotion information that may be used to support both clients and responders. We use our preliminary findings to discuss the way forward for applying AI to support mental health providers in providing better care.",10.1145/3656156.3663694,1,Scopus,85198905949,2-s2.0-85198905949,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198905949
COVID-19 Mental Health Impact Analysis using Ensemble-based Classifier,Jayakumari R.B.,2024,Open Public Health Journal,"Introduction: In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, human community witnessed a range of biological crises resulting in long-term consequences like loss of life, economic decline, trauma and social disruptions. COVID-19, named the SARs-CoV-2 virus by United Nations, was a similar outbreak in China in the year 2019, which later spread across the world. During the pandemic, as part of preventive measures, the government authorities introduced SOP (standard operating procedures) measures such as social distancing, lockdown, quarantining and closure of educational institutions imposing a great impact on mental health and well-being of humans, especially among the youth. Materials and Methods: A study was performed on a public dataset containing survey records collected from 1182 students of different educational institutions. The survey data was based on age, region of residence, time spent online and health fitness. The method used in the proposed work is a classifier model based on an ensemble of decision trees called random forest to predict the consequences of online learning on student’s health. The optimum and promising features are selected by using Recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. Results: Our findings reveal a notable enhancement in predicting human health during a pandemic, as indicated by a significant increase in validation accuracy based on confusion for various classifiers. Experimental validation of the developed classifier model is done through the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Further, performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and error rate were employed. The experimental results established the superiority of the proposed ensemble subspace discriminant classifier compared to traditional classifiers. Discussions: The RFE feature selection method used in the proposed work helps to select the optimum features as well as more informative features. Moreover, the method employed hyper parameter tuning method to enhance the performance of the classifier model. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of taking care of the emotional and physical health of humans during any pandemic. Furthermore, our approach possesses the capacity to significantly influence the field of predicting health, facilitating the development of more effective and advanced prediction strategies in the future.",10.2174/0118749445312597240726054050,0,Scopus,85201605819,2-s2.0-85201605819,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201605819
Handling missing data when estimating causal effects with targeted maximum likelihood estimation,Dashti S.G.,2024,American Journal of Epidemiology,"Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) is increasingly used for doubly robust causal inference, but how missing data should be handled when using TMLE with data-adaptive approaches is unclear. Based on data (1992-1998) from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate 8 missing-data methods in this context: complete-case analysis, extended TMLE incorporating an outcome-missingness model, the missing covariate missing indicator method, and 5 multiple imputation (MI) approaches using parametric or machine-learning models. We considered 6 scenarios that varied in terms of exposure/outcome generation models (presence of confounder-confounder interactions) and missingness mechanisms (whether outcome inf luenced missingness in other variables and presence of interaction/nonlinear terms in missingness models). Complete-case analysis and extended TMLE had small biases when outcome did not inf luence missingness in other variables. Parametric MI without interactions had large bias when exposure/outcome generation models included interactions. Parametric MI including interactions performed best in bias and variance reduction across all settings, except when missingness models included a nonlinear term. When choosing a method for handling missing data in the context of TMLE, researchers must consider the missingness mechanism and, for MI, compatibility with the analysis method. In many settings, a parametric MI approach that incorporates interactions and nonlinearities is expected to perform well.",10.1093/aje/kwae012,6,Scopus,85195614500,2-s2.0-85195614500,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195614500
Promoting Mental Health of Adolescents with a Mild Intellectual Disability,Ooms S.,2024,Umap 2024 Adjunct Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Conference on User Modeling Adaptation and Personalization,"Promoting mental health in adolescents is crucial to minimize the development of mental health disorders, especially for those with a mild intellectual disability who face more mental health challenges. In general, they have more difficulty controlling their feelings and show an overrepresentation in feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and other emotional problems. To improve their mental health, traditional teaching methods are unsuitable. Digital mental health intervention is a promising approach to do this in a fun, rewarding, and personally relevant manner. This PhD research uses a participatory approach to (1) identify the needs of these adolescents and (2) how to design, develop, and evaluate a digital intervention for mental health promotion. First school observations and interviews with staff suggest to improve self-reliance skills, finding help, and reflecting on wellbeing. The design process will focus on developing a personalized intervention that suits each adolescent's needs, as home context and support network vary.",10.1145/3631700.3664920,0,Scopus,85198925964,2-s2.0-85198925964,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198925964
A Chatbot-Delivered Stress Management Coaching for Students (MISHA App): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,Ulrich S.,2024,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"BACKGROUND: Globally, students face increasing mental health challenges, including elevated stress levels and declining well-being, leading to academic performance issues and mental health disorders. However, due to stigma and symptom underestimation, students rarely seek effective stress management solutions. Conversational agents in the health sector have shown promise in reducing stress, depression, and anxiety. Nevertheless, research on their effectiveness for students with stress remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a conversational agent-delivered stress management coaching intervention for students called MISHA and to evaluate its effectiveness, engagement, and acceptance. METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, Swiss students experiencing stress were recruited on the web. Using a 1:1 randomization ratio, participants (N=140) were allocated to either the intervention or waitlist control group. Treatment effectiveness on changes in the primary outcome, that is, perceived stress, and secondary outcomes, including depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, and active coping, were self-assessed and evaluated using ANOVA for repeated measure and general estimating equations. RESULTS: The per-protocol analysis revealed evidence for improvement of stress, depression, and somatic symptoms with medium effect sizes (Cohen d=-0.36 to Cohen d=-0.60), while anxiety and active coping did not change (Cohen d=-0.29 and Cohen d=0.13). In the intention-to-treat analysis, similar results were found, indicating reduced stress (β estimate=-0.13, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.05; P<.001), depressive symptoms (β estimate=-0.23, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.08; P=.003), and psychosomatic symptoms (β estimate=-0.16, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.06; P=.003), while anxiety and active coping did not change. Overall, 60% (42/70) of the participants in the intervention group completed the coaching by completing the postintervention survey. They particularly appreciated the quality, quantity, credibility, and visual representation of information. While individual customization was rated the lowest, the target group fitting was perceived as high. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that MISHA is feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing perceived stress among students in Switzerland. Future research is needed with different populations, for example, in students with high stress levels or compared to active controls.

Engaging University Students in Practical Physics Labs through Motivational Active Learning,Akingbola O.G.,2024,ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition Conference Proceedings,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on student's motivation to learn. As a result, the in-person laboratory session evolved into a virtual laboratory session. Despite this effort, many students struggled with the home front effects, such as communication gaps, digital literacy issues, unfavorable home environments, parental participation, etc. This led to the adoption of an enhanced motivation strategy to lessen the consequences of the pandemic on students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study. As such, several studies used software tools like machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), technology-enabled active learning (TEAL), and other methods to improve students' motivation. These approaches could limit students from acquiring hands-on skills, which lowers their technical proficiency-a vital skill for STEM students. However, only a few studies have used Active Learning Pedagogical tools to improve student learning in practical physics labs, especially in historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Also, the difficulty undergraduate students have in making connections between their theory teachings and their practical exercises, as well as how pertinent these lab sessions are to their everyday lives, has led to the conclusion that physics experiments are highly abstract. This study used low-cost, interactive, code-free, portable technology to improve students' practical experiences and report how these experiments are applied in everyday activities. The study involved 50 STEM students registered for the Introduction to physics laboratory course. According to the students' feedback and the motivated strategy for learning questionnaires adopted, they were very motivated and had less anxiety with enhanced critical thinking.",,0,Scopus,85202071309,2-s2.0-85202071309,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202071309
Examining Procrastination in Online Learning Environments: Implications for Student Performance,Agrawal S.,2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Academic procrastination, defined as the tendency of students to delay or postpone completing academic tasks, such as studying for an exam, doing homework, or writing an essay has become very common these days. Studies show that every four out of every five college students are affected by academic procrastination, nearly affecting all college students. These already concerning numbers have probably surged even further post the pandemic because so many students are now taking their classes online and having to deal with increased stress and loneliness. Within this context, this study examines the direct effects of procrastination on student's performance. We also examined whether social media learning through platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook mediate the relationship between procrastination and student's performance. Using an online survey, the data was collected from 240 students studying at a private university in India. The data was analyzed using structure equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analysis. The findings indicate that procrastination has a negative connection with social media learning and student's performance. It was also found that engaging in social media learning positively correlates with student performance, implying that utilizing social media for educational purposes is associated with enhanced performance. Additionally, the findings suggest that utilizing social media for learning can mitigate the negative impact of procrastination on student performance. This study highlights that educators and policymakers should consider integrating social media tools into educational practices and developing strategies to address procrastination effectively, promoting positive learning outcomes and student well-being.",10.1145/3678392.3678411,0,Scopus,85204928351,2-s2.0-85204928351,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204928351
Population Mental Health Science: Guiding Principles and Initial Agenda,Dodge K.A.,2024,American Psychologist,"A recent American Psychological Association Summit provided an urgent call to transform psychological science and practice away from a solely individual-level focus to become accountable for population-level impact on health and mental health. A population focus ensures the mental health of all children, adolescents, and adults and the elimination of inequities across groups. Science must guide three components of this transformation. First, effective individual-level interventions must be scaled up to the population level using principles from implementation science, investing in novel intervention delivery systems (e.g., online, mobile application, text, interactive voice response, and machine learning-based), harnessing the strength of diverse providers, and forging culturally informed adaptations. Second, policy-driven communitylevel interventions must be innovated and tested, such as public efforts to promote physical activity, public policies to support families in early life, and regulation of corporal punishment in schools. Third, transformation is needed to create a new system of universal primary care for mental health, based on models such as Family Connects, Triple P, PROmoting School-community-university Partnerships to Enhance Resilience, Communities That Care, and the Early Childhood Collaborative of the Pittsburgh Study. This new system must incorporate valid measurement, universal screening, and a community-based infrastructure for service delivery. Addressing tasks ahead, including scientific creativity and discovery, rigorous evaluation, and community accountability, will lead to a comprehensive strategic plan to shape the emergent field of public mental health.",10.1037/amp0001334,25,Scopus,85197266956,2-s2.0-85197266956,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197266956
"The greener the living environment, the better the health? Examining the effects of multiple green exposure metrics on physical activity and health among young students",Mao Y.,2024,Environmental Research,"The sedentary and less active lifestyle of modern college students has a significant impact on the physical and mental well-being of the college community. Campus Green Spaces (GSs) are crucial in promoting physical activity and improving students' health. However, previous research has focused on evaluating campuses as a whole, without considering the diverse spatial scenarios within the campus environment. Accordingly, this study focused on the young people's residential scenario in university and constructed a framework including a comprehensive set of objective and subjective GSs exposure metrics. A systematic, objective exposure assessment framework ranging from 2D (GSs areas), and 2.5D (GSs visibility) to 3D (GSs volume) was innovatively developed using spatial analysis, deep learning technology, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measurement technology. Subjective exposure metrics incorporated GSs visiting frequency, GSs visiting duration, and GSs perceived quality. Our cross-sectional study was based on 820 university students in Nanjing, China. Subjective measures of GSs exposure, physical activity, and health status were obtained through self-reported questionnaires. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to evaluate the associations between GSs exposure, physical activity, and perceived health. Physical activity and social cohesion were considered as mediators, and path analysis based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to disentangle the mechanisms linking GSs exposure to the health status of college students. We found that (1) 2D indicator suggested significant associations with health in the 100m buffer, and the potential underlying mechanisms were: GSs area → Physical activity → Social cohesion → Physical health → Mental health; GSs area → Physical activity → Social cohesion → Mental health. (2) Subjective GSs exposure indicators were more relevant in illustrating exposure-response relationships than objective ones. This study can clarify the complex nexus and mechanisms between campus GSs, physical activity, and health, and provide a practical reference for health-oriented campus GSs planning.",10.1016/j.envres.2024.118520,16,Scopus,85186768861,2-s2.0-85186768861,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186768861
Integrating wearable sensor data and self-reported diaries for personalized affect forecasting,Yang Z.,2024,Smart Health,"Emotional states, as indicators of affect, are pivotal to overall health, making their accurate prediction before onset crucial. Current studies are primarily centered on immediate short-term affect detection using data from wearable and mobile devices. These studies typically focus on objective sensory measures, often neglecting other forms of self-reported information like diaries and notes. In this paper, we propose a multimodal deep learning model for affect status forecasting. This model combines a transformer encoder with a pre-trained language model, facilitating the integrated analysis of objective metrics and self-reported diaries. To validate our model, we conduct a longitudinal study, enrolling college students and monitoring them over a year, to collect an extensive dataset including physiological, environmental, sleep, metabolic, and physical activity parameters, alongside open-ended textual diaries provided by the participants. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves predictive accuracy of 82.50% for positive affect and 82.76% for negative affect, a full week in advance. The effectiveness of our model is further elevated by its explainability.",10.1016/j.smhl.2024.100464,7,Scopus,85189020299,2-s2.0-85189020299,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189020299
Objective monitoring of loneliness levels using smart devices: A multi-device approach for mental health applications,Jafarlou S.,2024,Plos One,"Loneliness is linked to wide ranging physical and mental health problems, including increased rates of mortality. Understanding how loneliness manifests is important for targeted public health treatment and intervention. With advances in mobile sending and wearable technologies, it is possible to collect data on human phenomena in a continuous and uninterrupted way. In doing so, such approaches can be used to monitor physiological and behavioral aspects relevant to an individual’s loneliness. In this study, we proposed a method for continuous detection of loneliness using fully objective data from smart devices and passive mobile sensing. We also investigated whether physiological and behavioral features differed in their importance in predicting loneliness across individuals. Finally, we examined how informative data from each device is for loneliness detection tasks. We assessed subjective feelings of loneliness while monitoring behavioral and physiological patterns in 30 college students over a 2-month period. We used smartphones to monitor behavioral patterns (e.g., location changes, type of notifications, in-coming and out-going calls/text messages) and smart watches and rings to monitor physiology and sleep patterns (e.g., heart-rate, heart-rate variability, sleep duration). Participants reported their loneliness feeling multiple times a day through a questionnaire app on their phone. Using the data collected from their devices, we trained a random forest machine learning based model to detect loneliness levels. We found support for loneliness prediction using a multi-device and fully-objective approach. Furthermore, behavioral data collected by smartphones generally were the most important features across all participants. The study provides promising results for using objective data to monitor mental health indicators, which could provide a continuous and uninterrupted source of information in mental healthcare applications.",10.1371/journal.pone.0298949,9,Scopus,85196882178,2-s2.0-85196882178,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196882178
Examining how gamers connect with their avatars to assess their anxiety: A novel artificial intelligence approach,Hein K.,2024,Acta Psychologica,"Research has supported that a gamer's attachment to their avatar can offer significant insights about their mental health, including anxiety. To assess this hypothesis, longitudinal data from 565 adult and adolescent participants (M<inf>age</inf> = 29.3 years, SD = 10.6) was analyzed at two points, six months apart. Respondents were assessed using the User-Avatar Bond (UAB) scale and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) to measure their connection with their avatar and their risk for anxiety. The records were processed using both untuned and tuned artificial intelligence [AI] classifiers to evaluate present and future anxiety. The findings indicated that AI models are capable of accurately and autonomously discerning cases of anxiety risk based on the gamers' self-reported UAB, age, and duration of gaming, both at present and after six months. Notably, random forest algorithms surpassed other AI models in effectiveness, with avatar compensation emerging as the most significant factor in model training for prospective anxiety.

Mental health analysis of international students using machine learning techniques,Rahman M.A.,2024,Plos One,"International students' mental health has become an increasing concern in recent years, as more students leave their country for better education. They experience a wide range of challenges while studying abroad that have an impact on their psychological well-being. These challenges can include language obstacles, cultural differences, homesickness, financial issues and other elements that could severely impact the mental health of international students. Given the limited research on the demographic, cultural, and psychosocial variables that influence international students' mental health, and the scarcity of studies on the use of machine learning algorithms in this area, this study aimed to analyse data to understand the demographic, cultural factors, and psychosocial factors that impact mental health of international students. Additionally, this paper aimed to build a machine learningbased model for predicting depression among international students in the United Kingdom. This study utilized both primary data gathered through an online survey questionnaire targeted at international students and secondary data was sourced from the 'A Dataset of Students' Mental Health and Help-Seeking Behaviors in a Multicultural Environment,' focusing exclusively on international student data within this dataset. We conducted data analysis on the primary data and constructed models using the secondary data for predicting depression among international students. The secondary dataset is divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for analysis, employing four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbor. To assess each algorithm's performance, we considered metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision and AU-ROC curve. This study identifies significant demographic variables (e.g., loan status, gender, age, marital status) and psychosocial factors (financial difficulties, academic stress, homesickness, loneliness) contributing to international students' mental health.

User Experiences of Well-Being Chatbots,Kettle L.,2024,Human Factors,"Objective: The current paper conducted two parallel studies to explore user experiences of well-being conversational agents (CAs) and identify important features for engagement. Background: Students transitioning into university life take on greater responsibility, yet tend to sacrifice healthy behaviors to strive for academic and financial gain. Additionally, students faced an unprecedented pandemic, leading to remote courses and reduced access to healthcare services. One tool designed to improve healthcare accessibility is well-being CAs. CAs have addressed mental health support in the general population but have yet to address physical well-being support and accessibility to those in disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds where healthcare access is further limited. Method: Study One comprised a thematic analysis of mental health applications featuring CAs from the public forum, Reddit. Study Two explored emerging usability themes of an SMS-based CA designed to improve accessibility to well-being services alongside a commercially available CA, Woebot. Results: Study One identified several themes, including accessibility and availability, communication style, and anthropomorphism as important features. Study Two identified themes such as user response modality, perceived CA role, question specificity, and conversation flow control as critical for user engagement. Conclusion: Various themes emerged from individuals’ experiences regarding CA features, functionality, and responses. The mixed experiences relevant to the communication and conversational styles between the CA and the user suggest varied motivations for using CAs for mental and physical well-being.

Age-related behavioral resilience in smartphone touchscreen interaction dynamics,Ceolini E.,2024,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"We experience a life that is full of ups and downs. The ability to bounce back after adverse life events such as the loss of a loved one or serious illness declines with age, and such isolated events can even trigger accelerated aging. How humans respond to common day-to-day perturbations is less clear. Here, we infer the aging status from smartphone behavior by using a decision tree regression model trained to accurately estimate the chronological age based on the dynamics of touchscreen interactions. Individuals (N = 280, 21 to 87 y of age) expressed smartphone behavior that appeared younger on certain days and older on other days through the observation period that lasted up to ~4 y. We captured the essence of these fluctuations by leveraging the mathematical concept of critical transitions and tipping points in complex systems. In most individuals, we find one or more alternative stable aging states separated by tipping points. The older the individual, the lower the resilience to forces that push the behavior across the tipping point into an older state. Traditional accounts of aging based on sparse longitudinal data spanning decades suggest a gradual behavioral decline with age. Taken together with our current results, we propose that the gradual age-related changes are interleaved with more complex dynamics at shorter timescales where the same individual may navigate distinct behavioral aging states from one day to the next. Real-world behavioral data modeled as a complex system can transform how we view and study aging.",10.1073/pnas.2311865121,2,Scopus,85195887884,2-s2.0-85195887884,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195887884
Effective Motion Self-Learning Genre Using 360° Virtual Reality Content on Mobile Device: A Study Based on Taichi Training Platform,Wang L.,2024,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,"Online fitness training, with its affordability and flexibility, offers a convenient way for individuals to engage in regular workouts that promote physical and mental health. Yet, learning fitness motions in this way presents various challenges and may not always be as effective as in-person training. To address the practical demands of motion learning, we conducted a systematic survey and accordingly proposed a four-stage self-learning genre that integrates immersive virtual reality (VR) environments with motion skill learning theories, strategies, and expert experience. Herein, we merged progressive structures and multi-level visual cues to enhance instruction, and proposed a fine-grained motion analysis method to provide adaptive correction feedback during training. Utilizing a Taichi training platform with the genre embedded, we systematically validated the effectiveness of the genre, and examined the potential impact of VR content presentation form on motion learning among different age groups, as well as their preferences and focus on VR fitness training genre design. Results from the quantitative analysis, qualitative evaluation, and case study showed that the 360° video-based VR content brought more positive motion learning performance and user experiences than the fully-simulated VR used in many previous studies. The proposed genre demonstrated outstandingly performance, experience, and usability, with each stage and design playing an effective role. Moreover, we offer several design considerations for VR fitness systems targeting diverse age groups, providing beneficial insights for VR development in the sports and health-related fields.",10.1109/JBHI.2024.3371470,5,Scopus,85187362382,2-s2.0-85187362382,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187362382
Influences on COVID-19 Vaccine Adherence among Pregnant Women: The Role of Internet Access and Pre-Vaccination Emotions,Carvalho de Sousa R.,2024,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Introduction: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about global uncertainties and fears, escalating the dissemination of fake news. This study aims to analyze the impact of fake news on COVID-19 vaccine adherence among pregnant women, providing crucial insights for effective communication strategies during the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, exploratory study was conducted with 113 pregnant women under care at a Women’s Health Reference Center. Data analysis included relative frequency and odds ratio to assess the relationship between sociodemographic and behavioral variables regarding vaccination. Results: In the behavioral context of vaccination, internet access shows a significant association with decision-making, influencing vaccine refusal due to online information. Nuances in the odds ratios results highlight the complexity of vaccine hesitancy, emphasizing the importance of information quality. Pre-vaccination sentiments include stress (87.61%), fear (50.44%), and anxiety (40.7%), indicating the need for sensitive communication strategies. Discussion: Results revealed that pregnant women with higher education tend to adhere more to vaccination. Exposure to news about vaccine inefficacy had a subtle association with hesitancy, while finding secure sources was negatively associated with hesitancy. The behavioral complexity in the relationship between online information access and vaccination decision underscores the need for effective communication strategies. Conclusions: In the face of this challenging scenario, proactive strategies, such as developing specific campaigns for pregnant women, are essential. These should provide clear information, debunk myths, and address doubts. A user-centered approach, understanding their needs, is crucial. Furthermore, ensuring information quality and promoting secure sources are fundamental measures to strengthen trust in vaccination and enhance long-term public health.",10.3390/ijerph21060719,1,Scopus,85197110871,2-s2.0-85197110871,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197110871
Using AI-Based Virtual Companions to Assist Adolescents with Autism in Recognizing and Addressing Cyberbullying,Ferrer R.,2024,Sensors,"Social media platforms and online gaming sites play a pervasive role in facilitating peer interaction and social development for adolescents, but they also pose potential threats to health and safety. It is crucial to tackle cyberbullying issues within these platforms to ensure the healthy social development of adolescents. Cyberbullying has been linked to adverse mental health outcomes among adolescents, including anxiety, depression, academic underperformance, and an increased risk of suicide. While cyberbullying is a concern for all adolescents, those with disabilities are particularly susceptible and face a higher risk of being targets of cyberbullying. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing a personalized online virtual companion guided by artificial intelligence (AI). The web-based virtual companion’s interactions aim to assist adolescents in detecting cyberbullying. More specifically, an adolescent with ASD watches a cyberbullying scenario in a virtual environment, and the AI virtual companion then asks the adolescent if he/she detected cyberbullying. To inform the virtual companion in real time to know if the adolescent has learned about detecting cyberbullying, we have implemented fast and lightweight cyberbullying detection models employing the T5-small and MobileBERT networks.

The Psychosocial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Italian Families: The Perception of Quality of Life and Screening of Psychological Symptoms,Incardona R.M.,2024,Pediatric Reports,"Throughout the COVID-19 period, families were forced to stay indoors, adapting to online schooling, remote work, and virtual social engagements, inevitably altering the dynamics within households. There was a notable increase in mental health challenges in terms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. This study intended to explore the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian families by adopting self- and proxy-report questionnaires on anxiety, anger, and health-related quality of life. The results showed that approximately 20% obtained a clinical anxiety score and only 10% obtained a clinical anger score. There was a difference in the perception of the quality of life reported by the child and that perceived by the parent. A stepwise regression model showed that total anxiety scores were predicted by sex, quality of life scores from the parents’ self-report version, and the total anger score. Another stepwise regression model identified physiological and social anxiety as the best predictors that impact quality of life. Parental well-being actively influences the well-being of children, so it is fundamental to implement preventive programs and promote child well-being by providing parents the most adequate support possible.",10.3390/pediatric16020043,0,Scopus,85197108718,2-s2.0-85197108718,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197108718
Problematic Behaviors and Predicting Online Risk Behaviors in High School Students,B. Dowdell E.,2024,Journal of School Nursing,"Adolescent behavior now occurs offline and online. Frequently studied and treated independently, the relationship between offline problem behaviors and online risk taking is not well understood. This study asked whether there are any problematic behaviors predictive of online risk taking by high school students. Using a 2009 dataset of 2,077 high school students grades 9–12, five areas of offline problematic behaviors were examined: Academic problems, anxiety, behavioral wrongdoing, bullying, and social-emotional. Nine binary results were classified as online risk: Sexting, online harassment (perpetrating and experiencing), visiting sex sites, talking about sex, receiving sexual pictures, meeting offline, anything sexual happened, feeling nervous or uncomfortable. Behavioral wrongdoing (fighting, school suspension, trouble with police, theft), emerged as a significant predictor appearing in all nine models, followed by bullying experience (bully or victim) in six models. Identifying common problem behaviors that predict online risk taking are key components in developing strategies to promote adolescent health and well-being.",10.1177/10598405221091481,0,Scopus,85129599245,2-s2.0-85129599245,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129599245
"DIGIPREDICT: Physiological, behavioural and environmental predictors of asthma attacks - A prospective observational study using digital markers and artificial intelligence - Study protocol",Chan A.H.Y.,2024,BMJ Open Respiratory Research,"Introduction Asthma attacks are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality but are preventable in most if detected and treated promptly. However, the changes that occur physiologically and behaviourally in the days and weeks preceding an attack are not always recognised, highlighting a potential role for technology. The aim of this study 'DIGIPREDICT' is to identify early digital markers of asthma attacks using sensors embedded in smart devices including watches and inhalers, and leverage health and environmental datasets and artificial intelligence, to develop a risk prediction model to provide an early, personalised warning of asthma attacks. Methods and analysis A prospective sample of 300 people, 12 years or older, with a history of a moderate or severe asthma attack in the last 12 months will be recruited in New Zealand. Each participant will be given a smart watch (to assess physiological measures such as heart and respiratory rate), peak flow meter, smart inhaler (to assess adherence and inhalation) and a cough monitoring application to use regularly over 6 months with fortnightly questionnaires on asthma control and well-being. Data on sociodemographics, asthma control, lung function, dietary intake, medical history and technology acceptance will be collected at baseline and at 6 months. Asthma attacks will be measured by self-report and confirmed with clinical records. The collected data, along with environmental data on weather and air quality, will be analysed using machine learning to develop a risk prediction model for asthma attacks. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee (2023 FULL 13541). Enrolment began in August 2023.

Learning About Social Context from Smartphone Data: Generalization Across Countries and Daily Life Moments,Mäder A.R.,2024,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Proceedings,"Understanding how social situations unfold in people's daily lives is relevant to designing mobile systems that can support users in their personal goals, well-being, and activities. As an alternative to questionnaires, some studies have used passively collected smartphone sensor data to infer social context (i.e., being alone or not) with machine learning models. However, the few existing studies have focused on specific daily life occasions and limited geographic cohorts in one or two countries. This limits the understanding of how inference models work in terms of generalization to everyday life occasions and multiple countries. In this paper, we used a novel, large-scale, and multimodal smartphone sensing dataset with over 216K self-reports collected from 581 young adults in five countries (Mongolia, Italy, Denmark, UK, Paraguay), first to understand whether social context inference is feasible with sensor data, and then, to know how behavioral and country-level diversity affects inferences. We found that several sensors are informative of social context, that partially personalized multi-country models (trained and tested with data from all countries) and country-specific models (trained and tested within countries) can achieve similar performance above 90% AUC, and that models do not generalize well to unseen countries regardless of geographic proximity. These findings confirm the importance of the diversity of mobile data, to better understand social context inference models in different countries.",10.1145/3613904.3642444,8,Scopus,85193498952,2-s2.0-85193498952,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193498952
The Role of AI in Peer Support for Young People: A Study of Preferences for Human- and AI-Generated Responses,Young J.,2024,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Proceedings,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrated into everyday technology, including news, education, and social media. AI has further pervaded private conversations as conversational partners, auto-completion, and response suggestions. As social media becomes young people's main method of peer support exchange, we need to understand when and how AI can facilitate and assist in such exchanges in a beneficial, safe, and socially appropriate way. We asked 622 young people to complete an online survey and evaluate blinded human- and AI-generated responses to help-seeking messages. We found that participants preferred the AI-generated response to situations about relationships, self-expression, and physical health. However, when addressing a sensitive topic, like suicidal thoughts, young people preferred the human response. We also discuss the role of training in online peer support exchange and its implications for supporting young people's well-being.

Machine Learning Insights into Eating Disorder Twitter Communities,Kao H.T.,2024,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Proceedings,"Eating disorders have serious impacts on young population physical, psychological, and social functioning. Health agencies are calling for new psycho-therapeutic intervention considerations that take into account online communities, which is not possible if therapists know little about eating disorders discussions online. In this paper, we leverage machine learning analytics to understand what the eating disorder communities are talking about over time and how they are talking about it. By analyzing local and global community discussions, we discovered complex group dynamics underpinning collective identities offering emotional support but also potentially perpetuating harmful behaviors. Our analysis of four local subcommunities and four global theme evolutions revealed prevalent subjects, perspectives, motivations, and linguistic patterns.

Relationship between circadian rhythm and sleep quality in university students: the chain mediation roles of trait anxiety and sleep beliefs and attitudes,Wang H.,2024,Academic Journal of Naval Medical University,"Objective To investigate the relationship between circadian rhythm type and sleep quality among university students, and to clarify the mediating roles of trait anxiety and sleep beliefs and attitudes. Methods An online survey was conducted among university students at a medical school by convenience sampling method. The circadian rhythm types, trait anxiety levels, sleep beliefs and attitudes, and sleep quality were evaluated by the morning and evening questionnaire-5 (MEQ-5), trait anxiety inventory (T-AI), brief version of dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep scale-16 (DBAS-16), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), respectively. Pearson correlation analysis and mediation analysis were employed to examine the relationships between circadian rhythm types, trait anxiety levels, sleep beliefs and attitudes, and sleep quality. Results A total of 238 questionnaires were collected and 233 were valid, with an effective rate of 97.9%. Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between circadian rhythm type, trait anxiety level, sleep beliefs and attitudes, and sleep quality (all P＜0.01). The mediating effect was examined with circadian rhythm type as independent variable, sleep quality as dependent variable, and trait anxiety level and sleep beliefs and attitudes as mediating variables. The mediating effect of the trait anxiety level (MEQ-5 → T-AI → PSQI) accounted for 30.48% of the total effect (r＝-0.128, 95% confidence interval[CI] -0.211 to -0.066). The mediating effect of the sleep beliefs and attitudes (MEQ-5 → DBAS-16 → PSQI) accounted for 12.62% of the total effect (r＝-0.053, 95% CI -0.106 to -0.014). The chain mediating effects of the trait anxiety level and sleep beliefs and attitudes (MEQ-5 → T-AI → DBAS-16 → PSQI) accounted for 11.19% of the total effect (r＝-0.047, 95% CI -0.085 to -0.022).

Consistent movement of viewers' facial keypoints while watching emotionally evocative videos,Tripathi S.C.,2024,Plos One,"Neuropsychological research aims to unravel how diverse individuals' brains exhibit similar functionality when exposed to the same stimuli. The evocation of consistent responses when different subjects watch the same emotionally evocative stimulus has been observed through modalities like fMRI, EEG, physiological signals and facial expressions. We refer to the quantification of these shared consistent signals across subjects at each time instant across the temporal dimension as Consistent Response Measurement (CRM). CRM is widely explored through fMRI, occasionally with EEG, physiological signals and facial expressions using metrics like Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC). However, fMRI tools are expensive and constrained, while EEG and physiological signals are prone to facial artifacts and environmental conditions (such as temperature, humidity, and health condition of subjects). In this research, facial expression videos are used as a cost-effective and flexible alternative for CRM, minimally affected by external conditions. By employing computer vision-based automated facial keypoint tracking, a new metric similar to ISC, called the Average t-statistic, is introduced. Unlike existing facial expression-based methodologies that measure CRM of secondary indicators like inferred emotions, keypoint, and ICA-based features, the Average t-statistic is closely associated with the direct measurement of consistent facial muscle movement using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This is evidenced in DISFA dataset where the time-series of Average t-statistic has a high correlation (R2 = 0.78) with a metric called AU consistency, which directly measures facial muscle movement through FACS coding of video frames. The simplicity of recording facial expressions with the automated Average t-statistic expands the applications of CRM such as measuring engagement in online learning, customer interactions, etc., and diagnosing outliers in healthcare conditions like stroke, autism, depression, etc. To promote further research, we have made the code repository publicly available.",10.1371/journal.pone.0302705,1,Scopus,85193590284,2-s2.0-85193590284,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193590284
Role of AI/ML in the study of mental health problems of the students: a bibliometric study,Rajkishan S.S.,2024,International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management,"According to several global burdens of disease reports, mental health issues are a leading cause of disease burden. A worrying trend is the increasing contribution of college students to this pool of mental health woes. Anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal thoughts are dominant emerging issues. This population cohort's demographic and socio-economic significance has made this an urgent social imperative for everyone. Of late, digital technologies, namely Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML)-based models, have gained prominence in resolving mental health issues of young people. This paper employs bibliometric analysis in a nascent attempt to document the research on applying AI & ML-based models in treating mental issues among students. The finding suggests an urgent need to align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, ""Health and Well-Being"", and create awareness at the individual, family, society, university, and country levels and the world at large.

Latent profiles of academic resilience in undergraduate nursing students and their association with resilience and self-efficacy,Tan W.y.,2024,Nurse Education in Practice,"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of academic resilience among nursing students using latent profile analysis and its associated influencing factors. Background: Nursing students experience higher levels of stress compared to their peers in other professions, and the cultivation of academic resilience plays a pivotal role in their ability to effectively cope with this stress. Academic resilience not only facilitates success in the face of academic adversity but also contributes to the promotion of mental well-being among nursing students. However, the current research on the academic resilience of nursing students has predominantly focused on a scale-centered total score approach, disregarding individual variability, and hindering the development to inform personalized interventions for enhancing academic resilience. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to collect a total of 644 nursing students from two medical schools in Guangzhou City. The participants were recruited through an online survey conducted from January to March 2023. The questionnaires consisted of a general information form, the Chinese version of the Academic Resilience Scale-30 (C-ARS-30), the 10-item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Latent profile analysis was used to identify distinct categories of academic resilience among nursing students, and influencing factors were examined through ordinal logistic regression analysis. Results: The academic resilience levels of nursing students can be divided into three potential categories: 'low academic resilience' (13.0%), 'moderate academic resilience' (70.0%), and 'high academic resilience' (17.0%). Level of grade, GPA, self-reported physical health level, resilience and self-efficacy were significantly influenced the different categories of academic resilience of nursing students (P<0.05). Conclusions: The majority of undergraduate nursing students were placed in the moderate academic resilience group, however, educational institutions should pay special attention to nursing students demonstrating low levels. Regular assessments of academic resilience are recommended, and personalized interventions should be tailored to address specific academic resilience characteristics across different grades of nursing students. Strategies aimed at enhancing academic resilience among nursing students may include improvements in GPA performance, attention to physical health, and the reinforcement of resilience and self-efficacy.",10.1016/j.nepr.2024.103949,8,Scopus,85189826188,2-s2.0-85189826188,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189826188
Predicting Outcomes of Antidepressant Treatment in Community Practice Settings,Simon G.E.,2024,Psychiatric Services Washington D C,"OBJECTIVE: The authors examined whether machine-learning models could be used to analyze data from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict patients' responses to antidepressant medications. METHODS: EHR data from a Washington State health system identified patients ages ≥13 years who started an antidepressant medication in 2016 in a community practice setting and had a baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score of ≥10 and at least one PHQ-9 score recorded 14-180 days later. Potential predictors of a response to antidepressants were extracted from the EHR and included demographic characteristics, psychiatric and substance use diagnoses, past psychiatric medication use, mental health service use, and past PHQ-9 scores. Random-forest and penalized regression analyses were used to build models predicting follow-up PHQ-9 score and a favorable treatment response (≥50% improvement in score). RESULTS: Among 2,469 patients starting antidepressant medication treatment, the mean±SD baseline PHQ-9 score was 17.3±4.5, and the mean lowest follow-up score was 9.2±5.9. Outcome data were available for 72% of the patients. About 48% of the patients had a favorable treatment response. The best-fitting random-forest models yielded a correlation between predicted and observed follow-up scores of 0.38 (95% CI=0.32-0.45) and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for a favorable response of 0.57 (95% CI=0.52-0.61). Results were similar for penalized regression models and for models predicting last PHQ-9 score during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction models using EHR data were not accurate enough to inform recommendations for or against starting antidepressant medication. Personalization of depression treatment should instead rely on systematic assessment of early outcomes.",10.1176/appi.ps.20230380,1,Scopus,85192028549,2-s2.0-85192028549,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192028549
Framework for suggesting corrective actions to help students intended at risk of low performance based on experimental study of college students using explainable machine learning model,Singh H.,2024,Education and Information Technologies,"Today, the main aim of educational institutes is to provide a high level of education to students, as career selection is one of the most important and quite difficult decisions for learners, so it is essential to examine students' capabilities and interests. Higher education institutions frequently face higher dropout rates, low academic achievement, and graduation delays. One potential answer to these issues is to better leverage student data stored in institutional databases and online learning platforms to forecast students' academic achievements early by using artificial intelligence and advanced computer algorithms. Several research projects have been launched with the goal of building systems that can predict student performance. However, a system that can forecast student performance and identify the various factors that directly impact it is required. The purpose of this research work is to create a model that correctly identifies students who are in danger of low performance, as well as to identify the factors that contribute to this phenomenon and suggesting the remedial actions so as to reduce dropout rate and low performance among students. The emphasis of this study is to explore various factors that may affect mental health which lead to low performance or loss of interest in studies. The developed model can accurately identify at-risk students with over 96.5% accuracy using Machine learning techniques. This study focuses extensively on various factors apart from academics, such as personal and family factors and their association with student performance. To increase the accuracy of performance predictions, the model combines explainable Machine learning techniques to outline the factors associated with poor performance and discusses a novel framework that will help to increase the accuracy of prediction of the established prediction system. This assists low-performing students in improving their academic metrics by executing corrective actions that address the issues. The proposed novel framework, with the help of a mapping table, will recommend corrective actions along with visualization using the heatmap technique which may help the students to perform better in exams, increase the institution's effectiveness, and improves any country’s economic growth and stability.",10.1007/s10639-023-12072-1,11,Scopus,85168353191,2-s2.0-85168353191,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168353191
A fusion architecture to deliver multipurpose mobile health services,González Bermúdez A.,2024,Computers in Biology and Medicine,"Mobile Health (mHealth) services typically make use of customized software architectures, leading to development-dependent fragmentation. Nevertheless, irrespective of their specific purpose, most mHealth services share common functionalities, where standard pieces could be reused or adapted to expedite service deployment and even extend the follow-up of appearing conditions under the same service. To harness compatibility and reuse, this article presents a data fusion architecture proposing a common design framework for mHealth services. An exhaustive mapping of mHealth functionalities identified in the literature serves as starting point. The architecture is then conceptualized making use of the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion model. The aim of the architecture is to exploit the multi-source data acquisition capabilities supported by smartphones and Internet of Things devices, and artificial intelligence-enabled feature fusion. A series of interconnected fusion layers ensure streamlined data management; each layer is composed of microservices which may be implemented or omitted depending on the specific goals of the healthcare service. Moreover, the architecture considers essential features related to authentication mechanisms, data sharing protocols, practitioner-patient communication, context-based notifications and tailored visualization interfaces. The effectiveness of the architecture is underscored by its instantiation for four real cases, encompassing risk assessment for youth with mental health issues, remote monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 patients, liquid intake control for kidney disease patients, and peritoneal dialysis treatment support.

In this paper, we investigate the role of PMA in human-chatbot interactions. Specifically, we seek to understand how PMA influence the perception of trust, likeability, and perceived safety of chatbots for mental health across two distinct age groups. We conduct an online experiment (N = 279) to evaluate chatbots with low and high PMA as targeted towards teenagers and adults. Our results indicate increased trust, likeability, and perceived safety in mental health chatbots displaying high PMA. A qualitative analysis revealed four themes, assessing participants' expectations of mental health chatbots in general, as well as targeted towards teenagers: Anthropomorphism, Warmth, Sensitivity, and Appearance manifestation. We show that PMA plays a crucial role in influencing the perceptions of chatbots and provide recommendations for designing socially appropriate mental health chatbots.",10.1145/3637410,14,Scopus,85193340768,2-s2.0-85193340768,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193340768
Conversational assessment using artificial intelligence is as clinically useful as depression scales and preferred by users,Weisenburger R.L.,2024,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Depression is prevalent, chronic, and burdensome. Due to limited screening access, depression often remains undiagnosed. Artificial intelligence (AI) models based on spoken responses to interview questions may offer an effective, efficient alternative to other screening methods. Objective: The primary aim was to use a demographically diverse sample to validate an AI model, previously trained on human-administered interviews, on novel bot-administered interviews, and to check for algorithmic biases related to age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Methods: Using the Aiberry app, adults recruited via social media (N = 393) completed a brief bot-administered interview and a depression self-report form. An AI model was used to predict form scores based on interview responses alone. For all meaningful discrepancies between model inference and form score, clinicians performed a masked review to determine which one they preferred. Results: There was strong concurrent validity between the model predictions and raw self-report scores (r = 0.73, MAE = 3.3). 90 % of AI predictions either agreed with self-report or with clinical expert opinion when AI contradicted self-report. There was no differential model performance across age, sex, race, or ethnicity. Limitations: Limitations include access restrictions (English-speaking ability and access to smartphone or computer with broadband internet) and potential self-selection of participants more favorably predisposed toward AI technology. Conclusion: The Aiberry model made accurate predictions of depression severity based on remotely collected spoken responses to a bot-administered interview. This study shows promising results for the use of AI as a mental health screening tool on par with self-report measures.",10.1016/j.jad.2024.01.212,12,Scopus,85184503269,2-s2.0-85184503269,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184503269
Association between high or low-quality carbohydrate with depressive symptoms and socioeconomic-dietary factors model based on XGboost algorithm: From NHANES 2007–2018,Dang X.,2024,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Depressive symptoms are a serious public mental health problem, and dietary intake is often considered to be associated with depressive symptoms. However, the relationship between the quality of dietary carbohydrates and depressive symptoms remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between high and low-quality carbohydrates and depressive symptoms and to attempt to construct an integrated model using machine learning to predict depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 4982 samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in this study. Carbohydrate intake was assessed by a 24-h dietary review, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9). Variance inflation factor (VIF) and Relief-F algorithms were used for variable feature selection. Results: The results of multivariate linear regression showed a negative association between high-quality carbohydrates and depressive symptoms (β: −0.147, 95 % CI: −0.239, −0.056, p = 0.002) and a positive association between low-quality carbohydrates and depressive symptoms (β: 0.018, 95 % CI: 0.007, 0.280, p = 0.001). Subsequently, we used the XGboost model to produce a comprehensive depressive symptom evaluation model and developed a corresponding online tool (http://8.130.128.194:5000/) to evaluate depressive symptoms clinically. Limitations: The cross-sectional study could not yield any conclusions regarding causality, and the model has not been validated with external data. Conclusions: Carbohydrate quality is associated with depressive symptoms, and machine learning models that combine diet with socioeconomic factors can be a tool for predicting depression severity.",10.1016/j.jad.2024.01.220,8,Scopus,85184503341,2-s2.0-85184503341,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184503341
The prediction of self-harm behaviors in young adults with multi-modal data: an XGBoost approach,Xu X.M.,2024,Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,"Objectives: To enhance the ability of predicting self-harm behaviors through multidimensional data and machine learning methods, and provide a foundation for future comprehensive interventions. Methods: One hundred and twelve young adults aged 18-22 years with self-harm behaviors participated in this study as an experimental group, 98 in the control group. Eighty-three social-demographic and genetic features were collected and analyzed by an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) approach. Results: We found significant differences in social-demographic and genetic features between the self-harm and control groups (p<0.05). With the XGBoost algorithm, the model reached 0.866 in sensitivity and 0.734 in specificity. The balanced accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.800, 0.789, and 0.828, respectively. The top 20 important features were, suicidal and self-injurious ideation (SSI) in the past year, rs1659400 (G/A), rs6296 (G/C), family history of mental disorders, rs11140800 (C/C), rs2770296 (T/T-C/T), rs1360780 (T/T), rs1147198 (G/T-G/G), SSI in the past month, rs4675690 (T/T), aggressive personality, rs211105 (G/G), rs1042173 (A/A), psychoticism, rs11178997 (T/T), rs1387923 (A/A), college-educated, rs7728378 (C/T-T/T), the quality of life, and rs1360780 (C/C). Limitations: The limited sample size could potentially undermine its credibility or representativeness. Moreover, the study did not take into account the duration or frequency of self-harm behaviors due to potential recall bias. Conclusions: The XGBoost is a reliable machine learning approach for analyzing multi-modal data to predict self-harm in young adults. When the social-demographic factors, personalities, and genetic features were considered, the NTRK2 gene showed great importance to self-harm in young adults.",10.1016/j.jadr.2024.100723,5,Scopus,85184052547,2-s2.0-85184052547,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184052547
Digital Disconnection: A Qualitative Study of Youth and Young Adult Perspectives on Cyberbullying and the Adoption of Auto-Detection or Software Tools,Polillo A.,2024,Journal of Adolescent Health,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the needs of youth and young adults, current gaps around safeguarding social media, and factors affecting adoption of data-driven auto-detection or software tools. Methods: This qualitative study is the first step of a larger initiative that aims to use participatory action research and co-design principles to develop a digital tool that targets cyberbullying. Youth and young adults aged 16–21 years were recruited to participate in semistructured focus groups between March 2020 and November 2021. Thematic analysis was used to develop themes, with a member-checking process to validate the findings. Results: Six focus groups were completed with 39 participants and five themes were generated from the analysis. Participants described the mental health impacts of cyberbullying on young people, the stigma associated with it, and the need for more mental health resources. They felt that additional efforts are needed to improve the school environment, school-based interventions, and training protocols to ensure that youth feel safe reporting cyberbullying. Most participants were open to using a digital solution but raised concerns around the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence and wanted it to be co-designed with young people, integrated across platforms, informed by data-driven decisions, and transparent with users. Discussion: Youth and young adults are accepting of a low-risk digital cyberbullying solution as current interventions are not meeting their needs.",10.1016/j.jadohealth.2023.11.395,4,Scopus,85181975530,2-s2.0-85181975530,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181975530
Evaluation of an Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Application for Student Wellbeing: Pilot Randomised Trial of the Mind Tutor,Ehrlich C.,2024,International Journal of Applied Positive Psychology,"There has been an increase in the number of UK university students disclosing mental health conditions in recent years. This paper describes the evaluation of the Mind Tutor app, an artificial intelligence based wellbeing app specifically designed for first year undergraduate students, which included a chatbot function that guided students to relevant wellbeing content. The content of the app was developed based on data about mental health and wellbeing issues reported by students and focussed on anxiety, low mood, academic study, transition to university and relationships. Two randomised controlled evaluation studies were conducted with N = 177 and N = 240 first year undergraduate students from two UK universities (the second due to delays in development work and difficulties with recruitment in the first trial). The Mind Tutor had no significant impact on student wellbeing. The study suffered from poor recruitment and retention rates. However, further research is warranted to understand factors that may increase engagement and acceptability of app based tools to increase student wellbeing.",10.1007/s41042-023-00133-2,8,Scopus,85174638970,2-s2.0-85174638970,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174638970
Income insecurity and mental health in pandemic times,Foremny D.,2024,Economics and Human Biology,"This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health by providing novel evidence of its interaction with labor market conditions and the long-term persistence of these effects. We run four waves of a large-scale representative survey in Spain between April 2020 and April 2022, and benchmark our data against a decade of pre-pandemic information. We document an increase in the share of individuals reporting depressive feelings from 16% prior to the pandemic to 46% in April 2020. We show that this effect is more pronounced for women, younger individuals and those with unstable incomes. We apply machine learning techniques, mediation analysis and event studies to document the role of the labor market as an important driver of these effects.

Breamy: An augmented reality mHealth prototype for surgical decision-making in breast cancer,Najafi N.,2024,Healthcare Technology Letters,"Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer, affecting approximately one in eight women during their lifetime. Deciding on breast cancer treatment, which includes the choice between surgical options, frequently demands prompt decision-making within an 8-week timeframe. However, many women lack the necessary knowledge and preparation for making informed decisions. Anxiety and unsatisfactory outcomes can result from inadequate decision-making processes, leading to decisional regret and revision surgeries. Shared decision-making and personalized decision aids have shown positive effects on patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes. Here, Breamy, a prototype mobile health application that utilizes augmented reality technology to assist breast cancer patients in making more informed decisions is introduced. Breamy provides 3D visualizations of different surgical procedures, aiming to improve confidence in surgical decision-making, reduce decisional regret, and enhance patient well-being after surgery. To determine the perception of the usefulness of Breamy, data was collected from 166 participants through an online survey. The results suggest that Breamy has the potential to reduce patients' anxiety levels and assist them in decision-making.",10.1049/htl2.12071,4,Scopus,85180919466,2-s2.0-85180919466,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180919466
Multimodal-based machine learning approach to classify features of internet gaming disorder and alcohol use disorder: A sensor-level and source-level resting-state electroencephalography activity and neuropsychological study,Lee J.Y.,2024,Comprehensive Psychiatry,"Objectives: Addictions have recently been classified as substance use disorder (SUD) and behavioral addiction (BA), but the concept of BA is still debatable. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further neuroscientific research to understand the mechanisms of BA to the same extent as SUD. The present study used machine learning (ML) algorithms to investigate the neuropsychological and neurophysiological aspects of addictions in individuals with internet gaming disorder (IGD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD). Methods: We developed three models for distinguishing individuals with IGD from those with AUD, individuals with IGD from healthy controls (HCs), and individuals with AUD from HCs using ML algorithms, including L1-norm support vector machine, random forest, and L1-norm logistic regression (LR). Three distinct feature sets were used for model training: a unimodal-electroencephalography (EEG) feature set combined with sensor- and source-level feature; a unimodal-neuropsychological feature (NF) set included sex, age, depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and general cognitive function, and a multimodal (EEG + NF) feature set. Results: The LR model with the multimodal feature set used for the classification of IGD and AUD outperformed the other models (accuracy: 0.712). The important features selected by the model highlighted that the IGD group had differential delta and beta source connectivity between right intrahemispheric regions and distinct sensor-level EEG activities. Among the NFs, sex and age were the important features for good model performance. Conclusions: Using ML techniques, we demonstrated the neurophysiological and neuropsychological similarities and differences between IGD (a BA) and AUD (a SUD).",10.1016/j.comppsych.2024.152460,10,Scopus,85184576477,2-s2.0-85184576477,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184576477
Machine Learning Analysis of Social Media’s Impact on Mental Health of Indian Youth,Pachava V.,2024,International Research Journal of Multidisciplinary Scope,"This study delves into the complex relationship between various mental health indicators and their influencing factors among Indian youths. It specifically examines how external validation, interactions on social media platforms, and demographic variables such as gender, age, and occupation impact a range of mental health outcomes. These outcomes include experiencing negative thoughts, a disinterest in activities, low self-esteem, the development of eating disorders, disturbances in sleep patterns, symptoms of depression, difficulties in concentration, and feelings of fatigue. Employing the theoretical framework of Social Cognitive Theory, this research utilized an online random sampling method to gather data from a diverse group of 151 Indian youth participants. The findings of this study highlight the significant role that external validation and social media usage play in shaping mental health conditions among the youth. This underscores the critical need for integrating digital literacy components into mental health initiatives, aiming to foster healthier online behaviors and interactions. Furthermore, the study advocates for a holistic approach to mental health care, emphasizing the consideration of the specific needs of various demographic segments. It suggests that future mental health policies and interventions should be culturally sensitive and responsive. The results of this research underscore the pressing necessity for ongoing investigations into these vital dynamics, aiming to better understand and address the mental health challenges faced by Indian youths.",10.47857/irjms.2024.v05i02.0592,1,Scopus,85193311538,2-s2.0-85193311538,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193311538
Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Escitalopram and Sertraline Side Effects With Pharmacokinetic Data in Children and Adolescents,Poweleit E.A.,2024,Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the first-line pharmacologic treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Many patients experience side effects that are difficult to predict, are associated with significant morbidity, and can lead to treatment discontinuation. Variation in SSRI pharmacokinetics could explain differences in treatment outcomes, but this is often overlooked as a contributing factor to SSRI tolerability. This study evaluated data from 288 escitalopram-treated and 255 sertraline-treated patients ≤ 18 years old to develop machine learning models to predict side effects using electronic health record data and Bayesian estimated pharmacokinetic parameters. Trained on a combined cohort of escitalopram- and sertraline-treated patients, a penalized logistic regression model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66–0.88), with 0.69 sensitivity (95% CI: 0.54–0.86), and 0.82 specificity (95% CI: 0.72–0.87). Medication exposure, clearance, and time since the last dose increase were among the top features. Individual escitalopram and sertraline models yielded an AUROC of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65–0.81) and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55–0.73), respectively. Post hoc analysis showed sertraline-treated patients with activation side effects had slower clearance (P = 0.01), which attenuated after accounting for age (P = 0.055). These findings raise the possibility that a machine learning approach leveraging pharmacokinetic data can predict escitalopram- and sertraline-related side effects. Clinicians may consider differences in medication pharmacokinetics, especially during dose titration and as opposed to relying on dose, when managing side effects. With further validation, application of this model to predict side effects may enhance SSRI precision dosing strategies in youth.",10.1002/cpt.3184,7,Scopus,85184228105,2-s2.0-85184228105,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184228105
Topic modeling on clinical social work notes for exploring social determinants of health factors,Sun S.,2024,JAMIA Open,"Objective: Existing research on social determinants of health (SDoH) predominantly focuses on physician notes and structured data within electronic medical records. This study posits that social work notes are an untapped, potentially rich source for SDoH information. We hypothesize that clinical notes recorded by social workers, whose role is to ameliorate social and economic factors, might provide a complementary information source of data on SDoH compared to physician notes, which primarily concentrate on medical diagnoses and treatments. We aimed to use word frequency analysis and topic modeling to identify prevalent terms and robust topics of discussion within a large cohort of social work notes including both outpatient and in-patient consultations. Materials and methods: We retrieved a diverse, deidentified corpus of 0.95 million clinical social work notes from 181644 patients at the University of California, San Francisco. We conducted word frequency analysis related to ICD-10 chapters to identify prevalent terms within the notes. We then applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling analysis to characterize this corpus and identify potential topics of discussion, which was further stratified by note types and disease groups. Results: Word frequency analysis primarily identified medical-related terms associated with specific ICD10 chapters, though it also detected some subtle SDoH terms. In contrast, the LDA topic modeling analysis extracted 11 topics explicitly related to social determinants of health risk factors, such as financial status, abuse history, social support, risk of death, and mental health. The topic modeling approach effectively demonstrated variations between different types of social work notes and across patients with different types of diseases or conditions. Discussion: Our findings highlight LDA topic modeling's effectiveness in extracting SDoH-related themes and capturing variations in social work notes, demonstrating its potential for informing targeted interventions for at-risk populations. Conclusion: Social work notes offer a wealth of unique and valuable information on an individual's SDoH. These notes present consistent and meaningful topics of discussion that can be effectively analyzed and utilized to improve patient care and inform targeted interventions for at-risk populations.",10.1093/jamiaopen/ooad112,7,Scopus,85182550513,2-s2.0-85182550513,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182550513
Developing a risk prediction model for death at first suicide attempt-Identifying risk factors from Thailand's national suicide surveillance system data,Arunpongpaisal S.,2024,Plos One,"More than 60% of suicides globally are estimated to take place in low- and middle-income nations. Prior research on suicide has indicated that over 50% of those who die by suicide do so on their first attempt. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of knowledge on the attributes of individuals who die on their first attempt and the factors that can predict mortality on the first attempt in these regions. The objective of this study was to create an individual-level riskprediction model for mortality on the first suicide attempt. We analyzed records of individuals' first suicide attempts that occurred between May 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018, from the national suicide surveillance system, which includes all of the provinces of Thailand. Subsequently, a risk-prediction model for mortality on the first suicide attempt was constructed utilizing multivariable logistic regression and presented through a web-based application. The model's performance was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), as well as measuring its sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Out of the 3,324 individuals who made their first suicide attempt, 50.5% of them died as a result of that effort. Nine out of the 21 potential predictors demonstrated the greatest predictive capability. These included male sex, age over 50 years old, unemployment, having a depressive disorder, having a psychotic illness, experiencing interpersonal problems such as being aggressively criticized or desiring plentiful attention, having suicidal intent, and displaying suicidal warning signals. The model demonstrated a good predictive capability, with an AUC of 0.902, a sensitivity of 84.65%, a specificity of 82.66%, and an accuracy of 83.63%. The implementation of this predictive model can assist physicians in conducting comprehensive evaluations of suicide risk in clinical settings and devising treatment plans for preventive intervention.",10.1371/journal.pone.0297904,3,Scopus,85190325985,2-s2.0-85190325985,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190325985
Support vector model to predict smartphone addiction in early adolescents,Anshori M.,2024,Aip Conference Proceedings,"Smartphones are an object that is always carried everywhere and cannot be separated from everyday life. Smartphones were created with various purposes and features present in terms of education, entertainment, information, communication, and others. Besides these positive things, smartphones also trigger negative impacts such as wasting time interacting with screens, reducing academic achievement, and even decreasing muscle mass due to lack of movement. The next level is to make people become addicted to smartphones. For early adolescent children, smartphone addictions cause insomnia, social behavior, low self-esteem, and even anxiety. The complexity of anxiety symptoms in children is difficult for adults to understand. So, a way to predict smartphone addiction in early adolescence was initiated with a machine learning method, namely the SVM algorithm. The experiment in this paper is the SVM kernel testing. The best performance of SVM is while using a linear kernel; the accuracy reaches 96.4467%.",10.1063/5.0192301,1,Scopus,85190605134,2-s2.0-85190605134,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190605134
Trait anxiety and corresponding neuromarkers predict internet addiction: A longitudinal study,He M.,2024,Journal of Behavioral Addictions,"Background and Aims: The high prevalence of internet addiction (IA) has become a worldwide problem that profoundly affects people's mental health and executive function. Empirical studies have suggested trait anxiety (TA) as one of the most robust predictors of addictive behaviors. The present study investigated the neural and socio-psychological mechanisms underlying the association between TA and IA. Methods: Firstly, we tested the correlation between TA and IA. Then we investigated the longitudinal influence of TA on IA using a linear mixed effect (LME) model. Secondly, connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) was employed to explore neuromarkers of TA, and we tested whether the identified neuromarkers of TA can predict IA. Lastly, stressful life events and default mode network (DMN) were considered as mediating variables to explore the relationship between TA and IA. Findings: A significant positive correlation between TA and IA was found and the high TA group demonstrated higher IA across time. CPM results revealed that the functional connectivity of cognitive control and emotion-regulation circuits and DMN were significantly correlated with TA. Furthermore, a significant association was found between the neuromarkers of TA and IA. Notably, the CPM results were all validated in an independent sample. The results of mediation demonstrated that stressful life events and correlated functional connectivity mediated the association between TA and IA. Conclusions: Findings of the present study facilitate a deeper understanding of the neural and socio-psychological mechanisms linking TA and IA and provide new directions for developing neural and psychological interventions.",10.1556/2006.2023.00086,6,Scopus,85187687244,2-s2.0-85187687244,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187687244
Construction of the Monitoring and Analysis Model for University Students' Mental Health Based on Machine Learning,Xiang Y.,2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Paying attention to the mental health of university students has become one of the vital tasks of universities, and the traditional psychological monitoring and analysis mechanism can no longer meet the needs of universities.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Is Associated With Elevated Risk of Incident Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack in Women Veterans,Ebrahimi R.,2024,Journal of the American Heart Association,"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with ischemic heart disease in women veterans, but evidence for associations with other cardiovascular disorders remains limited in this population. This retrospective longitudinal cohort study evaluated the association of PTSD with incident stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) in women veterans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Veterans Health Administration electronic health records were used to identify women veterans aged ≥18 years engaged with Veterans Health Administration health care from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2019. We identified women veterans with and without PTSD without a history of stroke or TIA at start of follow-up. Propensity score matching was used to match groups on age, race or ethnicity, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, female-specific risk factors, a range of mental and physical health conditions, and number of prior health care visits. PTSD, stroke, TIA, and risk factors used in propensity score matching were based on diagnostic codes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for associations of PTSD with an incident stroke/TIA composite. Subanalyses considered stroke and TIA separately, plus age-and race-or ethnicity-stratified analyses were carried out. The analytic sample included 208 092 women veterans (104 046 with and 104 046 without PTSD). PTSD was associated with a greater rate of developing stroke/TIA (HR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.25–1.42], P<0.001). This elevated risk was especially pronounced in women <50 years old and in Hispanic/Latina women. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a strong association of PTSD with incident stroke/TIA in women veterans. Research is needed to determine whether addressing PTSD and its downstream consequences can offset this risk.",10.1161/JAHA.123.033032,3,Scopus,85187202523,2-s2.0-85187202523,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187202523

Articles included in this Virtual Issue are a selection of Dr. Taylor's published works in the Journal in the past decade, spanning original research, ideas worth researching, commentaries, and a systematic review. We hope this Virtual Issue will inspire the next generation of research in EDs, and equally, if not more importantly, the next generation of young investigators in the field. We urge the field to continue and build upon Dr. Taylor's vision—to increase access to targeted prevention and intervention for EDs in innovative and forward-thinking ways—while embracing his unique and powerful mentorship style to lift up early career investigators and create a community of leaders to address and solve our field's biggest challenges.",10.1002/eat.24145,0,Scopus,85184244954,2-s2.0-85184244954,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184244954
"Towards a New Conceptual Model of AI-Enhanced Learning for College Students: The Roles of Artificial Intelligence Capabilities, General Self-Efficacy, Learning Motivation, and Critical Thinking Awareness",Jia X.H.,2024,Systems,"In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, college students have faced various challenges that could negatively impact their critical thinking abilities due to disruptions to education, increased stress and anxiety, less social interaction, and the advancement of distance learning relying more heavily on digital tools. With the increasing integration of AI technology across sectors, higher education institutions have deployed various AI capabilities for intelligent campuses and modernized teaching. However, how to fully utilize AI capabilities to promote students’ thinking awareness on learning effectiveness is still not clear, as critical thinking is an essential skill set holding significant implications for college students’ development. This research adopts the resource-based theory (RBT) to conceptualize the university as a unified entity of artificial intelligence (AI) resources. It aims to investigate whether AI capabilities can foster critical thinking awareness among students by enhancing general self-efficacy and learning motivation. In particular, it examines the causal relationships between AI capabilities, general self-efficacy, motivation and critical thinking awareness. Primary data was collected through a questionnaire administered to 637 college students. Structural equation modeling was employed to test hypotheses pertaining to causality. The results showed that AI capabilities could indirectly enhance students’ critical thinking awareness by strengthening general self-efficacy and learning motivation, but the effect on critical thinking awareness was not significant. Meanwhile, general self-efficacy significantly affected the formation of learning motivation and critical thinking awareness. This indicates that AI capabilities are able to reshape the cognitive learning process, but its direct influence on thinking awareness needs to be viewed with caution. This study explored the role of AI capabilities in education from the perspective of organizational capabilities. It not only proves how AI facilitates cognition, but also discovered the important mediating role of general self-efficacy and motivation in this process. This finding explains the inherent connections between the mechanism links. Furthermore, the study expands research on AI capabilities research from the technical level to the educational field. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth theoretical explanation theoretically, guiding the practice and application of AI in education. The study is of positive significance for understanding the need for the future development of the cultivation of critical thinking awareness talents needed for future development through AI capabilities in education.",10.3390/systems12030074,83,Scopus,85188926752,2-s2.0-85188926752,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188926752
"Multitask Learning for Mental Health: Depression, Anxiety, Stress (DAS) Using Wearables",Saylam B.,2024,Diagnostics,"This study investigates the prediction of mental well-being factors—depression, stress, and anxiety—using the NetHealth dataset from college students. The research addresses four key questions, exploring the impact of digital biomarkers on these factors, their alignment with conventional psychology literature, the time-based performance of applied methods, and potential enhancements through multitask learning. The findings reveal modality rankings aligned with psychology literature, validated against paper-based studies. Improved predictions are noted with temporal considerations, and further enhanced by multitasking. Mental health multitask prediction results show aligned baseline and multitask performances, with notable enhancements using temporal aspects, particularly with the random forest (RF) classifier. Multitask learning improves outcomes for depression and stress but not anxiety using RF and XGBoost.",10.3390/diagnostics14050501,8,Scopus,85187478996,2-s2.0-85187478996,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187478996
"Visual, ocular surface, and extraocular diagnostic criteria for determining the prevalence of computer vision syndrome: a cross-sectional smart-survey-based study",Iqbal M.,2024,Medical Hypothesis Discovery and Innovation in Ophthalmology,"Background: The American Optometric Association defines computer vision syndrome (CVS), also known as digital eye strain, as “a group of eye-and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and cell phone use”. We aimed to create a well-structured, valid, and reliable questionnaire to determine the prevalence of CVS, and to analyze the visual, ocular surface, and extraocular sequelae of CVS using a novel and smart self-assessment questionnaire. Methods: This multicenter, observational, cross-sectional, descriptive, survey-based, online study included 6853 complete online responses of medical students from 15 universities. All participants responded to the updated, online, fourth version of the CVS questionnaire (CVS-F4), which has high validity and reliability. CVS was diagnosed according to five basic diagnostic criteria (5DC) derived from the CVS-F4. Respondents who fulfilled the 5DC were considered CVS cases. The 5DC were then converted into a novel five-question self-assessment questionnaire designated as the CVS-Smart. Results: Of 10 000 invited medical students, 8006 responded to the CVS-F4 survey (80% response rate), while 6853 of the 8006 respondents provided complete online responses (85.6% completion rate). The overall CVS prevalence was 58.78% (n = 4028) among the study respondents; CVS prevalence was higher among women (65.87%) than among men (48.06%). Within the CVS group, the most common visual, ocular surface, and extraocular complaints were eye strain, dry eye, and neck/shoulder/back pain in 74.50% (n = 3001), 58.27% (n = 2347), and 80.52% (n = 3244) of CVS cases, respectively. Notably, 75.92% (3058/4028) of CVS cases were involved in the Mandated Computer System Use Program. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the two most statistically significant diagnostic criteria of the 5DC were ≥2 symptoms/attacks per month over the last 12 months (odds ratio [OR] = 204177.2; P <0.0001) and symptoms/attacks associated with screen use (OR = 16047.34; P <0.0001). The CVS-Smart demonstrated a Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient of 0.860, Guttman split-half coefficient of 0.805, and construct validity of 100%. A CVS-Smart score of 7–10 points indicated the presence of CVS. Conclusions: The visual, ocular surface, and extraocular diagnostic criteria for CVS constituted the basic components of CVS-Smart. CVS-Smart is a novel, valid, reliable, subjective instrument for determining CVS diagnosis and prevalence and may provide a tool for rapid periodic assessment and prognostication. Individuals with positive CVS-Smart results should consider modifying their lifestyles and screen styles and seeking the help of ophthalmologists and/or optometrists. Higher institutional authorities should consider revising the Mandated Computer System Use Program to avoid the long-term consequences of CVS among university students. Further research must compare CVS-Smart with other available metrics for CVS, such as the CVS questionnaire, to determine its test-retest reliability and to justify its widespread use.",10.51329/mehdiophthal1489,1,Scopus,85198826738,2-s2.0-85198826738,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198826738
Discovering the Impact of Bullying on Adolescents Through Bibliometric Analysis,Wahyuni S.,2024,Scripta Medica Banja Luka,"In recent years, the number of bullying cases, especially among teenagers, has been increasing, with many mass media reports on bullying cases that have resulted in the death of the victim. The aim of the study was to explore the impact of bullying on adolescents by analysing of network visualisation, overlay visualisation and density visualisation on the topic through bibliometric analysis. Records were identified through a database search at https://app.dimensions.ai/. The data obtained was then selected further by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. Papers were limited to publication years 2019-2023 and focussed on the fields of psychology, human society, health sci-ence, clinical biomedicine, clinical education and health psychology. Data were analysed using VOSviewer, then reviewed by co-occurrence and co-author. After identifying the clusters, the impacts of bullying on adolescents were suicidal behaviour, mental disorders, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), loneliness, psychological distress and adolescent childhood experiences (ACEs). From the overlay visualisation, it was indicated that the newest topics that were being widely researched related to the impact of bullying on adolescents were social anxiety, suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, suicidal thought, integrated behaviour change (IBC) and peer victimisation. From density visualisation, it was indicated that topics that were rarely researched related to the topic of the impact of bullying on adolescent were suicide attempts, early victimisation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidality. The theme regarding the impact of bullying needs and developed to be researched more deeply, especially on themes with low visualisation found in density visualisation, in order to enrich the variety of research.",10.5937/scriptamed55-47959,4,Scopus,85191790825,2-s2.0-85191790825,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191790825
Evaluation framework for conversational agents with artificial intelligence in health interventions: a systematic scoping review,Ding H.,2024,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,"Objectives: Conversational agents (CAs) with emerging artificial intelligence present new opportunities to assist in health interventions but are difficult to evaluate, deterring their applications in the real world. We aimed to synthesize existing evidence and knowledge and outline an evaluation framework for CA interventions. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic scoping review to investigate designs and outcome measures used in the studies that evaluated CAs for health interventions. We then nested the results into an overarching digital health framework proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Results: The review included 81 studies evaluating CAs in experimental (n 59), observational (n 15) trials, and other research designs (n 7). Most studies (n 72, 89%) were published in the past 5 years. The proposed CA-evaluation framework includes 4 evaluation stages: (1) feasibility/usability, (2) efficacy, (3) effectiveness, and (4) implementation, aligning with WHO's stepwise evaluation strategy. Across these stages, this article presents the essential evidence of different study designs (n 8), sample sizes, and main evaluation categories (n 7) with subcategories (n 40). The main evaluation categories included (1) functionality, (2) safety and information quality, (3) user experience, (4) clinical and health outcomes, (5) costs and cost benefits, (6) usage, adherence, and uptake, and (7) user characteristics for implementation research. Furthermore, the framework highlighted the essential evaluation areas (potential primary outcomes) and gaps across the evaluation stages. Discussion and Conclusion: This review presents a new framework with practical design details to support the evaluation of CA interventions in healthcare research.",10.1093/jamia/ocad222,17,Scopus,85183836968,2-s2.0-85183836968,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183836968
Predicting suicide death after emergency department visits with mental health or self-harm diagnoses,Simon G.E.,2024,General Hospital Psychiatry,"Objective: Use health records data to predict suicide death following emergency department visits. Methods: Electronic health records and insurance claims from seven health systems were used to: identify emergency department visits with mental health or self-harm diagnoses by members aged 11 or older; extract approximately 2500 potential predictors including demographic, historical, and baseline clinical characteristics; and ascertain subsequent deaths by self-harm. Logistic regression with lasso and random forest models predicted self-harm death over 90 days after each visit. Results: Records identified 2,069,170 eligible visits, 899 followed by suicide death within 90 days. The best-fitting logistic regression with lasso model yielded an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.823 (95% CI 0.810–0.836). Visits above the 95th percentile of predicted risk included 34.8% (95% CI 31.1–38.7) of subsequent suicide deaths and had a 0.303% (95% CI 0.261–0.346) suicide death rate over the following 90 days. Model performance was similar across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Conclusions: Machine learning models using coded data from health records have moderate performance in predicting suicide death following emergency department visits for mental health or self-harm diagnosis and could be used to identify patients needing more systematic follow-up.",10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2024.01.009,6,Scopus,85183293758,2-s2.0-85183293758,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183293758
Effectiveness of Antidepressants in Combination with Psychotherapy,Alemi F.,2024,Journal of Mental Health Policy and Economics,"Background: Consensus-guidelines for prescribing antidepressants recommend that clinicians should be vigilant to match antidepressants to patient's medical history but provide no specific advice on which antidepressant is best for a given medical history. Aims of the Study: For patients with major depression who are in psychotherapy, this study provides an empirically derived guideline for prescribing antidepressant medications that fit patients' medical history. Methods: This retrospective, observational, cohort study analyzed a large insurance database of 3,678,082 patients. Data was obtained from healthcare providers in the U.S. between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2018. These patients had 10,221,145 episodes of antidepressant treatments. This study reports the remission rates for the 14 most commonly prescribed single antidepressants (amitriptyline, bupropion, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, doxepin, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine) and a category named ""Other"" (other antidepressants/combination of antidepressants). The study used robust LASSO regressions to identify factors that affected remission rate and clinicians' selection of antidepressants. The selection bias in observational data was removed through stratification. We organized the data into 16,770 subgroups, of at least 100 cases, using the combination of the largest factors that affected remission and selection bias. This paper reports on 2,467 subgroups of patients who had received psychotherapy. Results: We found large, and statistically significant, differences in remission rates within subgroups of patients. Remission rates for sertraline ranged from 4.5% to 77.86%, for fluoxetine from 2.86% to 77.78%, for venlafaxine from 5.07% to 76.44%, for bupropion from 0.5% to 64.63%, for desvenlafaxine from 1.59% to 75%, for duloxetine from 3.77% to 75%, for paroxetine from 6.48% to 68.79%, for escitalopram from 1.85% to 65%, and for citalopram from 4.67% to 76.23%. Clearly these medications are ideal for patients in some subgroups but not others. If patients are matched to the subgroups, clinicians can prescribe the medication that works best in the subgroup. Some medications (amitriptyline, doxepin, nortriptyline, and trazodone) always had remission rates below 11% and therefore were not suitable as single antidepressant therapy for any of the subgroups. Discussions: This study provides an opportunity for clinicians to identify an optimal antidepressant for their patients, before they engage in repeated trials of antidepressants. Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: To facilitate the matching of patients to the most effective antidepressants, this study provides access to a free, non-commercial, decision aid at http:// MeAgainMeds.com. Implications for Health Policies: Policymakers should evaluate how study findings can be made available through fragmented electronic health records at point-of-care. Alternatively, policymakers can put in place an AI system that recommends antidepressants to patients online, at home, and encourages them to bring the recommendation to their clinicians at their next visit. Implications for Further Research: Future research could investigate (i) the effectiveness of our recommendations in changing clinical practice, (ii) increasing remission of depression symptoms, and (iii) reducing cost of care. These studies need to be prospective but pragmatic. It is unlikely random clinical trials can address the large number of factors that affect remission.",,0,Scopus,85190849875,2-s2.0-85190849875,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190849875
Mobile health (m-health) smartphone interventions for adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity,Metzendorf M.I.,2024,Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,"Background: Obesity is considered to be a risk factor for various diseases, and its incidence has tripled worldwide since 1975. In addition to potentially being at risk for adverse health outcomes, people with overweight or obesity are often stigmatised. Behaviour change interventions are increasingly delivered as mobile health (m-health) interventions, using smartphone apps and wearables. They are believed to support healthy behaviours at the individual level in a low-threshold manner. Objectives: To assess the effects of integrated smartphone applications for adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS, as well as the trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 2 October 2023 (date of last search for all databases). We placed no restrictions on the language of publication. Selection criteria: Participants were adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. Eligible interventions were integrated smartphone apps using at least two behaviour change techniques. The intervention could target physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, weight loss, healthy diet, or self-efficacy. Comparators included no or minimal intervention (NMI), a different smartphone app, personal coaching, or usual care. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of any duration with a follow-up of at least three months. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodology and the RoB 2 tool. Important outcomes were physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and weight, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, well-being, change in dietary behaviour, and adverse events. We focused on presenting studies with medium- (6 to < 12 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) outcomes in our summary of findings table, following recommendations in the core outcome set for behavioural weight management interventions. Main results: We included 18 studies with 2703 participants. Interventions lasted from 2 to 24 months. The mean BMI in adults ranged from 27 to 50, and the median BMI z-score in adolescents ranged from 2.2 to 2.5. Smartphone app versus no or minimal intervention. Thirteen studies compared a smartphone app versus NMI in adults; no studies were available for adolescents. The comparator comprised minimal health advice, handouts, food diaries, smartphone apps unrelated to weight loss, and waiting list. Measures of physical activity: at 12 months' follow-up, a smartphone app compared to NMI probably reduces moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) slightly (mean difference (MD) −28.9 min/week (95% confidence interval (CI) −85.9 to 28; 1 study, 650 participants; moderate-certainty evidence)). We are very uncertain about the results of estimated energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory fitness at eight months' follow-up. A smartphone app compared with NMI probably results in little to no difference in changes in total activity time at 12 months' follow-up and leisure time physical activity at 24 months' follow-up. Anthropometric measures: a smartphone app compared with NMI may reduce BMI (MD of BMI change −2.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI −6 to 0.8; 2 studies, 146 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at six to eight months' follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain. At 12 months' follow-up, a smartphone app probably resulted in little to no difference in BMI change (MD −0.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI −0.4 to 0.3; 1 study; 650 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A smartphone app compared with NMI may result in little to no difference in body weight change (MD −2.5 kg, 95% CI −6.8 to 1.7; 3 studies, 1044 participants; low-certainty evidence) at 12 months' follow-up. At 24 months' follow-up, a smartphone app probably resulted in little to no difference in body weight change (MD 0.7 kg, 95% CI −1.2 to 2.6; 1 study, 245 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A smartphone app compared with NMI may result in little to no difference in self-efficacy for a physical activity score at eight months' follow-up, but the results are very uncertain. A smartphone app probably results in little to no difference in quality of life and well-being at 12 months (moderate-certainty evidence) and in little to no difference in various measures used to inform dietary behaviour at 12 and 24 months' follow-up. We are very uncertain about adverse events, which were only reported narratively in two studies (very low-certainty evidence). Smartphone app versus another smartphone app. Two studies compared different versions of the same app in adults, showing no or minimal differences in outcomes. One study in adults compared two different apps (calorie counting versus ketogenic diet) and suggested a slight reduction in body weight at six months in favour of the ketogenic diet app. No studies were available for adolescents. Smartphone app versus personal coaching. Only one study compared a smartphone app with personal coaching in adults, presenting data at three months. Two studies compared these interventions in adolescents. A smartphone app resulted in little to no difference in BMI z-score compared to personal coaching at six months' follow-up (MD 0, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.2; 1 study; 107 participants). Smartphone app versus usual care. Only one study compared an app with usual care in adults but only reported data at three months on participant satisfaction. No studies were available for adolescents. We identified 34 ongoing studies. Authors' conclusions: The available evidence is limited and does not demonstrate a clear benefit of smartphone applications as interventions for adolescents or adults with overweight or obesity. While the number of studies is growing, the evidence remains incomplete due to the high variability of the apps' features, content and components, which complicates direct comparisons and assessment of their effectiveness. Comparisons with either no or minimal intervention or personal coaching show minor effects, which are mostly not clinically significant. Minimal data for adolescents also warrants further research. Evidence is also scarce for low- and middle-income countries as well as for people with different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. The 34 ongoing studies suggest sustained interest in the topic, with new evidence expected to emerge within the next two years. In practice, clinicians and healthcare practitioners should carefully consider the potential benefits, limitations, and evolving research when recommending smartphone apps to adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity.",10.1002/14651858.CD013591.pub2,23,Scopus,85185720977,2-s2.0-85185720977,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185720977
Using ecological momentary assessment and machine learning techniques to predict depressive symptoms in emerging adults,De la Barrera U.,2024,Psychiatry Research,"The objective of this study was to predict the level of depressive symptoms in emerging adults by analyzing sociodemographic variables, affect, and emotion regulation strategies. Participants were 33 emerging adults (M = 24.43; SD = 2.80; 56.3 % women). They were asked to assess their current emotional state (positive or negative affect), recent events that may relate to that state, and emotion regulation strategies through ecological momentary assessment. Participants were prompted randomly by an app 6 times per day between 10 am and 10 pm for a seven-day period. They answered 1233 of the 2058 surveys (beeps), collectively. The analysis of observations, using Machine Learning (ML) techniques, showed that the Random Forest algorithm yields significantly better predictions than other models. The algorithm used 13 out of the 36 variables adopted in the study. Furthermore, the study revealed that age, emotion of worried and a specific emotion regulation strategy related to social exchange were the most accurate predictors of severe depressive symptoms. By carefully selecting predictors and utilizing appropriate sorting techniques, these findings may provide valuable supplementary information to traditional diagnostic methods and psychological assessments",10.1016/j.psychres.2023.115710,8,Scopus,85182955772,2-s2.0-85182955772,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182955772
Visualizing machine learning-based predictions of postpartum depression risk for lay audiences,Desai P.M.,2024,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,"Objectives: To determine if different formats for conveying machine learning (ML)-derived postpartum depression risks impact patient classification of recommended actions (primary outcome) and intention to seek care, perceived risk, trust, and preferences (secondary outcomes). Materials and methods: We recruited English-speaking females of childbearing age (18-45 years) using an online survey platform. We created 2 exposure variables (presentation format and risk severity), each with 4 levels, manipulated within-subject. Presentation formats consisted of text only, numeric only, gradient number line, and segmented number line. For each format viewed, participants answered questions regarding each outcome. Results: Five hundred four participants (mean age 31 years) completed the survey. For the risk classification question, performance was high (93%) with no significant differences between presentation formats. There were main effects of risk level (all P <. 001) such that participants perceived higher risk, were more likely to agree to treatment, and more trusting in their obstetrics team as the risk level increased, but we found inconsistencies in which presentation format corresponded to the highest perceived risk, trust, or behavioral intention. The gradient number line was the most preferred format (43%). Discussion and conclusion: All formats resulted high accuracy related to the classification outcome (primary), but there were nuanced differences in risk perceptions, behavioral intentions, and trust. Investigators should choose health data visualizations based on the primary goal they want lay audiences to accomplish with the ML risk score.",10.1093/jamia/ocad198,5,Scopus,85182781129,2-s2.0-85182781129,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182781129
MULTIWD: Multi-label wellness dimensions in social media posts,Garg M.,2024,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,"Background: Halbert L. Dunn's concept of wellness is a multi-dimensional aspect encompassing social and mental well-being. Neglecting these dimensions over time can have a negative impact on an individual's mental health. The manual efforts employed in in-person therapy sessions reveal that underlying factors of mental disturbance if triggered, may lead to severe mental health disorders. Objective: In our research, we introduce a fine-grained approach focused on identifying indicators of wellness dimensions and mark their presence in self-narrated human-writings on Reddit social media platform. Design and Method: We present the MULTIWD dataset, a curated collection comprising 3281 instances, as a specifically designed and annotated dataset that facilitates the identification of multiple wellness dimensions in Reddit posts. In our study, we introduce the task of identifying wellness dimensions and utilize state-of-the-art classifiers to solve this multi-label classification task. Results: Our findings highlights the best and comparative performance of fine-tuned large language models with fine-tuned BERT model. As such, we set BERT as a baseline model to tag wellness dimensions in a user-penned text with F1 score of 76.69. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the need of trustworthy and domain-specific knowledge infusion to develop more comprehensive and contextually-aware AI models for tagging and extracting wellness dimensions.",10.1016/j.jbi.2024.104586,4,Scopus,85183330600,2-s2.0-85183330600,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183330600
Translating the user-avatar bond into depression risk: A preliminary machine learning study,Brown T.,2024,Journal of Psychiatric Research,"Research has shown a link between depression risk and how gamers form relationships with their in-game figure of representation, called avatar. This is reinforced by literature supporting that a gamer's connection to their avatar may provide broader insight into their mental health. Therefore, it has been argued that if properly examined, the bond between a person and their avatar may reveal information about their current or potential struggles with depression offline. To examine whether the connection with an individuals' avatars may reveal their risk for depression, longitudinal data from 565 adults/adolescents (Mage = 29.3 years, SD = 10.6) were evaluated twice (six months apart). Participants completed the User-Avatar-Bond [UAB] scale and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale to measure avatar bond and depression risk. A series of tuned and untuned artificial intelligence [AI] classifiers analyzed their responses concurrently and prospectively. This allowed the examination of whether user-avatar bond can provide cross-sectional and predictive information about depression risk. Findings revealed that AI models can learn to accurately and automatically identify depression risk cases, based on gamers' reported UAB, age, and length of gaming involvement, both at present and six months later. In particular, random forests outperformed all other AIs, while avatar immersion was shown to be the strongest training predictor. Study outcomes demonstrate that UAB can be translated into accurate, concurrent, and future, depression risk predictions via trained AI classifiers. Assessment, prevention, and practice implications are discussed in the light of these results.",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.12.038,11,Scopus,85182217778,2-s2.0-85182217778,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182217778
Debate: Social media content moderation may do more harm than good for youth mental health,Zhang C.C.,2024,Child and Adolescent Mental Health,"Most social media platforms censor and moderate content related to mental illness to protect users from harm, though this may be at the expense of potential positive outcomes for youth mental health. Current evidence does not offer strong support for the relationship between censoring mental health content and preventing harm. In fact, existing moderation strategies can perpetuate negative consequences for mental health by creating isolated and polarized communities where at-risk youth remain exposed to harmful content, such as pro-eating disorder communities that use lexical variants to evade censorship. Social media censorship of content related to mental illness can also silence positive discourse about mental health, create barriers to accessing online support and resources, and hinder research efforts on youth well-being. Social media content about mental health can have important positive impacts on youth mental health by facilitating help-seeking, depicting positive coping strategies, and promoting a sense of belonging for struggling youth, but these benefits are minimized under existing moderation and censorship practices. This article presents a call to action for evidence-based social media policies and for practitioners to consider the clinical implications of social media engagement when connecting with young patients.",10.1111/camh.12689,9,Scopus,85179319896,2-s2.0-85179319896,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179319896
Deep learning to explore the correlation between screen time and depression through analysis of the NHANES dataset,Regis Anne W.,2024,Roles and Challenges of Semantic Intelligence in Healthcare Cognitive Computing,"The explosion in the number of digital gadgets and the increasing integration of technology into daily life have led to a significant rise in screen time usage across various age groups. Also, the pandemic has moved us indoors leading every work to be done online. The screen time including the smart phones, Lap- tops and Televisions have increased among the teenagers with the advent of online education becoming a necessity and exceed the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. The time devoted to social media, online gaming, and entertainment platforms leads to depressive symptoms. The blue light emanating from these devices can cause intensive damage to the metal health of teenagers. The hazards of using these devices for a longer time has an influence both on their behaviour and their rational thinking. The effect on cognitive behaviour is reflected in their mental health like loneliness, degradation of personality level and suicidal thoughts. There arises a debate to find if usage of digital gadgets for a long time has depressive symptoms in teenagers. In this chapter the feasibility of detecting depression based on the screen time usage is explored and an awareness is created to promote healthier digital habits. The NHANES, dataset contains various standardized questionnaires designed to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms is considered for analysis. Some widely used depression scales include Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) etc., In this chapter, we have chosen HAM-D to assess the severity of depression in an individual. Higher scores indicate that the person is in severe depression and needs treatment. A Generalized regression neural network (GRNN) depression detection model based on screen time usage is proposed and the model is compared with Multilayer Neural Network (MLNN) Model.The proposed model gives an accuracy of 98.55.",10.3233/SSW230029,2,Scopus,85189829049,2-s2.0-85189829049,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189829049
Outcomes in Mental Health Counseling From Conversational Content With Transformer-Based Machine Learning,Imel Z.E.,2024,JAMA Network Open,"Importance: Use of asynchronous text-based counseling is rapidly growing as an easy-to-access approach to behavioral health care. Similar to in-person treatment, it is challenging to reliably assess as measures of process and content do not scale. Objective: To use machine learning to evaluate clinical content and client-reported outcomes in a large sample of text-based counseling episodes of care. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this quality improvement study, participants received text-based counseling between 2014 and 2019; data analysis was conducted from September 22, 2022, to November 28, 2023. The deidentified content of messages was retained as a part of ongoing quality assurance. Treatment was asynchronous text-based counseling via an online and mobile therapy app (Talkspace). Therapists were licensed to provide mental health treatment and were either independent contractors or employees of the product company. Participants were self-referred via online sign-up and received services via their insurance or self-pay and were assigned a diagnosis from their health care professional. Exposure: All clients received counseling services from a licensed mental health clinician. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were client engagement in counseling (number of weeks), treatment satisfaction, and changes in client symptoms, measured via the 8-item version of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). A previously trained, transformer-based, deep learning model automatically categorized messages into types of therapist interventions and summaries of clinical content. Results: The total sample included 166644 clients treated by 4973 therapists (20600274 messages). Participating clients were predominantly female (75.23%), aged 26 to 35 years (55.4%), single (37.88%), earned a bachelor's degree (59.13%), and were White (61.8%). There was substantial variability in intervention use and treatment content across therapists. A series of mixed-effects regressions indicated that collectively, interventions and clinical content were associated with key outcomes: engagement (multiple R = 0.43), satisfaction (multiple R = 0.46), and change in PHQ-8 score (multiple R = 0.13). Conclusions and Relevance: This quality improvement study found associations between therapist interventions, clinical content, and client-reported outcomes. Consistent with traditional forms of counseling, higher amounts of supportive counseling were associated with improved outcomes. These findings suggest that machine learning-based evaluations of content may increase the scale and specificity of psychotherapy research.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.52590,9,Scopus,85182912328,2-s2.0-85182912328,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182912328
Cyberbullying detection based on aspect-level sentiment analysis,Pan T.,2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Cyberbullying is prevalent among groups such as adolescents and college students, posing a significant threat to mental health. The advancement of natural language processing technology has enabled the rapid and effective detection of cyberbullying language, facilitating real-time monitoring of online harassment on the Internet. Therefore, researching how to better identify cyberbullying language holds important social significance. This study employs aspect-level sentiment analysis methods to achieve fine-grained recognition of cyberbullying language considering textual orientation. It combines named entity recognition to extract aspect words and proposes an aspect word sentiment analysis model based on the BERT-ADA model. The model enhances its learning capability for domain-specific knowledge through in-domain retraining. The results reveal that the proposed approach exhibits optimal model performance compared to popular baseline sentiment analysis models.

Understanding reminiscence and its negative functions in the everyday conversations of young adults: A machine learning approach,Ferrario A.,2024,Heliyon,"Reminiscence is the act of recalling or telling others about relevant personal past experiences. It is an important activity for all individuals, young and old alike. In fact, reminiscence can serve different functions that can support or be detrimental to one's well-being. Although previous studies have extensively investigated older adults' recalling of autobiographical memories, the evidence for young adults remains scarce. Therefore, in this work, we analyze young adults' production of reminiscence and their functions with a naturalistic observation method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that natural language processing and machine learning can automatically detect reminiscence and its negative functions in young adults' everyday conversations. We interpret machine learning model results using Shapley explanations. Our results indicate that young adults reminisce in everyday life mostly to connect with others through conversation, to compensate for a lack of stimulation or to recall difficult past experiences. Moreover, our models improve existing benchmarks from the literature on the automated detection of older adults' reminiscence in everyday life. Finally, our results may support the development of digital health intervention programs that detect reminiscence and its functions in young adults to support their well-being.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e23825,4,Scopus,85180591015,2-s2.0-85180591015,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180591015

Mental health services for German university students: acceptance of intervention targets and preference for delivery modes,Kählke F.,2024,Frontiers in Digital Health,"Introduction: Most university students with mental disorders remain untreated. Evaluating the acceptance of intervention targets in mental health treatment, promotion, and prevention, as well as mental health service delivery modes is crucial for reducing potential barriers, increasing healthcare utilization, and efficiently allocating resources in healthcare services. Aim: The study aimed to evaluate the acceptance of various intervention targets and delivery modes of mental health care services in German first-year university students. Methods: In total, 1,376 first-year students from two German universities from the 2017–2018 multi-center cross-sectional cohort of the StudiCare project, the German arm of the World Mental Health International College Student Survey initiative, completed a web-based survey assessing their mental health. Mental disorder status was based on self-reported data fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria. We report frequencies of accepted delivery modes [categories: group or in-person therapy with on or off campus services, self-help internet- or mobile-based intervention (IMI) with or without coaching, or a combination of a in-person and IMI (blended)]. In a multinomial logistic regression, we estimate correlates of the preference for in-person vs. IMI vs. a combination of both modes (blended) modalities. Additionally, we report frequencies of intervention targets (disorder specific: e.g., social phobia, depressive mood; study-related: test anxiety, procrastination; general well-being: sleep quality, resilience) their association with mental disorders and sex, and optimal combinations of treatment targets for each mental illness. Results: German university students' acceptance is high for in-person (71%–76%), moderate for internet- and mobile-based (45%–55%), and low for group delivery modes (31%–36%). In-person treatment (72%) was preferred over IMI (19%) and blended modalities (9%). Having a mental disorder [odds ratio (OR): 1.56], believing that digital treatments are effective (OR: 3.2), and showing no intention to use services (OR: 2.8) were associated with a preference for IMI compared to in-person modes. Students with prior treatment experience preferred in-person modes (OR: 0.46). In general, treatment targets acceptance was higher among female students and students with mental disorders. However, this was not true for targets with the highest (i.e., procrastination) and the lowest (i.e., substance-use disorder) acceptance. If only two intervention targets were offered, a combination of study-related targets (i.e., procrastination, stress, time management) would reach 85%–88% of the students. Conclusion: In-person services are preferred, yet half of the students consider using IMI, preferably aiming for a combination of at least two study-related intervention targets. Student mental health care services should offer a combination of accepted targets in different delivery modes to maximize service utilization.",10.3389/fdgth.2024.1284661,6,Scopus,85186190923,2-s2.0-85186190923,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186190923
Assessment of non-fatal injuries among university students in Hainan: a machine learning approach to exploring key factors,Lu K.,2024,Frontiers in Public Health,"Background: Injuries constitute a significant global public health concern, particularly among individuals aged 0–34. These injuries are affected by various social, psychological, and physiological factors and are no longer viewed merely as accidental occurrences. Existing research has identified multiple risk factors for injuries; however, they often focus on the cases of children or the older adult, neglecting the university students. Machine learning (ML) can provide advanced analytics and is better suited to complex, nonlinear data compared to traditional methods. That said, ML has been underutilized in injury research despite its great potential. To fill this gap, this study applies ML to analyze injury data among university students in Hainan Province. The purpose is to provide insights into developing effective prevention strategies. To explore the relationship between scores on the self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale and the risk of non-fatal injuries within 1 year, we categorized these scores into two groups using restricted cubic splines. Methods: Chi-square tests and LASSO regression analysis were employed to filter factors potentially associated with non-fatal injuries. The Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the dataset. Subsequent analyses were conducted using random forest, logistic regression, decision tree, and XGBoost models. Each model underwent 10-fold cross-validation to mitigate overfitting, with hyperparameters being optimized to improve performance. SHAP was utilized to identify the primary factors influencing non-fatal injuries. Results: The Random Forest model has proved effective in this study. It identified three primary risk factors for predicting non-fatal injuries: being male, favorable household financial situation, and stable relationship. Protective factors include reduced internet time and being an only child in the family. Conclusion: The study highlighted five key factors influencing non-fatal injuries: sex, household financial situation, relationship stability, internet time, and sibling status. In identifying these factors, the Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost models demonstrated varying effectiveness, with the Random Forest model exhibiting superior performance.",10.3389/fpubh.2024.1453650,0,Scopus,85211003836,2-s2.0-85211003836,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211003836

Effectiveness of the Minder Mobile Mental Health and Substance Use Intervention for University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,Vereschagin M.,2024,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: University attendance represents a transition period for students that often coincides with the emergence of mental health and substance use challenges. Digital interventions have been identified as a promising means of supporting students due to their scalability, adaptability, and acceptability. Minder is a mental health and substance use mobile app that was codeveloped with university students. Objective: This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the Minder mobile app in improving mental health and substance use outcomes in a general population of university students. Methods: A 2-arm, parallel-assignment, single-blinded, 30-day randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate Minder using intention-to-treat analysis. In total, 1489 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention (n=743, 49.9%) or waitlist control (n=746, 50.1%) condition. The Minder app delivers evidence-based content through an automated chatbot and connects participants with services and university social groups. Participants are also assigned a trained peer coach to support them. The primary outcomes were measured through in-app self-assessments and included changes in general anxiety symptomology, depressive symptomology, and alcohol consumption risk measured using the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and US Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Scale, respectively, from baseline to 30-day follow-up. Secondary outcomes included measures related to changes in the frequency of substance use (cannabis, alcohol, opioids, and nonmedical stimulants) and mental well-being. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to examine each outcome. Results: In total, 79.3% (589/743) of participants in the intervention group and 83% (619/746) of participants in the control group completed the follow-up survey. The intervention group had significantly greater average reductions in anxiety symptoms measured using the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale (adjusted group mean difference=-0.85, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.42; P<.001; Cohen d=-0.17) and depressive symptoms measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (adjusted group mean difference=-0.63, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.17; P=.007; Cohen d=-0.11). A reduction in the US Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Scale score among intervention participants was also observed, but it was not significant (P=.23). Statistically significant differences in favor of the intervention group were found for mental well-being and reductions in the frequency of cannabis use and typical number of drinks consumed. A total of 77.1% (573/743) of participants in the intervention group accessed at least 1 app component during the study period. Conclusions: In a general population sample of university students, the Minder app was effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, with provisional support for increasing mental well-being and reducing the frequency of cannabis and alcohol use.

Impact of Large-Scale Online Classes on College Students Learning Patterns,Farhan M.A.,2024,2nd International Conference on Emerging Research in Computational Science Icercs 2024,"Each college student has distinct learning experiences, objectives, and needs that educators must be aware of to improve learning. However, unclear online course architectures prevent online learners from establishing successful methods. The study examined how college students in an online course developed learning habits, goals, and needs. Online learning should support different learning styles because college students don't have distinct learning styles. Several methods can be used. Pedagogy emphasizes collaborative experiences, showing that effective learning is shaped, engaged with, and impacted by others. Most online education involves accessing presentation slides, video lectures, collaborative projects, and forum discussions. When using these resources, people with different goals, motivations, and predispositions may behave differently. Different habits can affect their learning ability more. Device logs from a learning management system in a learning machine were thoroughly analyzed. Many important discoveries have been made. Motivation and learning achievement are linked to several behaviors. Finally, college students had an online course ratio of 87.6%, a learning capability ratio of 88.7%, a knowledge development ratio of 84.5%, and an awareness ratio of 82.5%.

Adaptive Academic Buildings for Improving Comfort and Well-Being of College Students Using Artificial Intelligence of Things,Lee M.J.,2024,Computing in Civil Engineering 2023 Resilience Safety and Sustainability Selected Papers from the ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2023,"Academic buildings serve important roles for college students. Maintaining a comfortable built environment can benefit the well-being of college students and promote their performance and productivity. The most common way of maintaining a comfortable built environment is still highly manual and reactive; for example, students adjust the light levels when they have already had visibility issues. Existing Internet of Things (IoT)-based efforts facilitate real-time collection and analyzing indoor environmental quality (IEQ) data. However, they failed to incorporate feedback from students. To address this problem, this paper proposes the use of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) technologies to support academic building operations that can automatically and proactively adapt to the comfort needs of college students. The proposed framework consists of three steps: (1) collecting indoor environment data using IoT, (2) gathering direct and indirect feedback data from students, and (3) developing a transformer-based model for analyzing and predicting IEQ conditions.",10.1061/9780784485248.128,0,Scopus,85184118404,2-s2.0-85184118404,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184118404
A study of impulsivity as a predictor of problematic internet use in university students with disabilities,Pino M.J.,2024,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: The role played by impulsivity in problematic internet use (PIU) is the object of much debate among researchers. Some studies emphasize its importance, while others suggest mental distress or personality traits may be more crucial. More research into the issue is clearly needed—especially in at-risk populations like people with disabilities. The objectives of this study were therefore to investigate the relationship between PIU and impulsivity among university students with disabilities, and to develop a specific predictive model for this group that would include psychological and life-functioning variables. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used with a sample of 240 Spanish university students with disabilities from seven universities. Several instruments were used for data collection: a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), and NEO-FFI-R. Results: The results indicated that impulsivity is significantly correlated with PIU, as indeed it also is with other factors like conscientiousness and social functioning problems. The study's regression model explained nearly 50% of PIU variance, with impulsivity, personality traits, wellness and health indicators, and social media usage as predictive variables. Discussion: This suggests that interventions should consider these psychological and lifestyle variables as a means of mitigating PIU risks in students with disabilities.

Using biosensors and machine learning algorithms to analyse the influencing factors of study tours on students’ mental health,Li K.,2024,Mcb Molecular and Cellular Biomechanics,"College students nowadays will inevitably deal with stress. Personal emotional and behavioural responses may be extremely strong when faced with stress. One of the most prevalent sources of stress for college students throughout the globe is mental health issues connected to stress. However, there is a lack of research focusing on the impact of specific activities, such as study tours, on students’ mental health and how these activities can be monitored using advanced technologies. As a result of its ability to analyze, classify, and alert college students’ psychological data with high quality, deep learning and machine learning have recently found widespread application in college students’ mental health education and management. Moreover, the integration of biomechanics and biosensor data offers new insights into understanding the physical and psychological impacts of study tours on mental health. This can potentially promote the development of colleges’ mental health education programs. Hence, this study proposes the Biosensor-based and Deep Neural Network-based College Student Mental Health Prediction Model (BDNN-CSMHPM) for detecting the mental stress of college students during study tours. Using biosensor data, including EEG and biomechanical metrics, this model employs the most effective BDNN to categorize the mental health condition as normal, negative, or positive. Consequently, BDNN is utilized to categorize the gathered emotional and biomechanical information, and based on the classification outcomes, the emotional condition of college students is determined. Considering that different features might stand in for different elements in the original data, it is necessary to extract several biosensors features to represent the information in the original EEG data accurately. Second, fusing various features is essential in the auto-learn model integration method. Third, the BDNN is fed the combined features, resulting in emotion classification. The numerical outcomes demonstrate that the BDNN-CSMHPM model enhances the student’s mental health prediction ratio of 98.9%, accuracy ratio of 96.4%, emotion recognition ratio of 95.3%, Pearson correlation coefficient rate of 97.2% and psychological monitoring ratio of 94.3% compared to other popular methods.",10.62617/mcb.v21i1.328,4,Scopus,85205814169,2-s2.0-85205814169,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205814169

Mental Health with Machine Learning: A Prediction-Based Intervention Chatbot for Mental Health Conversations,Hermawan L.,2024,International Conference on Electrical Engineering Computer Science and Informatics Eecsi,"Academic mental health is crucial for university students as it directly influences their academic performance, personal well-being, and future professional development. Factors such as academic stress, social isolation, financial difficulties, and family expectations can negatively impact students' mental health. Early identification of these risk factors is essential for developing effective interventions to prevent more severe mental health issues. The development of a prediction-based intervention chatbot using a machine learning approach offers a promising solution. This research utilizes a dataset derived from the DASS-21 scale, which measures levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, comprising 424 records of question-and-answer variations to train the chatbot. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets with an 80:20 ratio, allowing for unbiased model evaluation. The study compared the performance of two machine learning models: Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB). Results showed that RFC outperformed MNB, achieving an accuracy of 82.5%, along with high precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant conversations and providing appropriate interventions. Although MNB is faster and more efficient, its lower accuracy of approximately 66% presents a risk of inaccurate responses.

Passive sensing data predicts stress in university students: a supervised machine learning method for digital phenotyping,Shvetcov A.,2024,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: University students are particularly susceptible to developing high levels of stress, which occur when environmental demands outweigh an individual’s ability to cope. The growing advent of mental health smartphone apps has led to a surge in use by university students seeking ways to help them cope with stress. Use of these apps has afforded researchers the unique ability to collect extensive amounts of passive sensing data including GPS and step detection. Despite this, little is known about the relationship between passive sensing data and stress. Further, there are no established methodologies or tools to predict stress from passive sensing data in this group. Methods: In this study, we establish a clear machine learning-based methodological pipeline for processing passive sensing data and extracting features that may be relevant in the context of mental health.

Hence, this paper implemented the Probabilistic Deep Belief Bayesian Network (PDBBN) to classify students’ mental health attributes. The proposed PDBBN network computes the probabilistic value of the mental health assessment of the students. With the estimation of the probabilistic model, the extracted features are applied in the Deep Belief Bayesian Network for the classification of student mental health with the Macromedia analysis in college students. The classification is performed with the consideration of information on gender, age, academic performance, social support scores, and self-reported levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, and each model across multiple epochs. Simulation is conducted in comparison with the proposed PDBBN model with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. The results indicate that PDBBN consistently outperforms CNN and DNN in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Understanding Digital Wellbeing Through Smartphone Usage Intentions and Regrettable Patterns,Islambouli R.,2024,Proceedings 2024 IEEE 12th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics Ichi 2024,"The ubiquitous presence of smartphones raises significant concerns regarding their impact on users' digital well-being. This study delves into the complex relationship between smartphone usage patterns and digital wellbeing while focusing on the physical, intellectual, mental and social dimensions of well-being. We examine the smartphone usage behaviors of university students over a span of two weeks, by logging smartphone usage data and simultaneously sampling users' perceived experiences. Drawing upon data from 48 university students, we reveal that digital wellbeing is intricately connected to the how, when, and why of smartphone usage. App-switching behavior and the diversity of individualized usage patterns play pivotal roles in shaping the digital wellbeing landscape. Additionally, the promotion of intentionality in smartphone interactions emerges as a critical strategy for enhancing digital wellbeing. These findings underscore the need for personalized interventions to enhance digital wellbeing in an era dominated by digital technology.",10.1109/ICHI61247.2024.00061,2,Scopus,85203717766,2-s2.0-85203717766,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203717766
Factors associated with suicidal ideation in veterinary medicine students,Percy Yabar M.,2024,Revista De Investigaciones Veterinarias Del Peru,"The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with suicidal ideation in students of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry at the Universidad Nacional del Altiplano, Puno, Peru. The research was descriptive, explanatory and cross-sectional, carried out with 406 undergraduate students, 51.7% (n = 210) male and 48.3% female (n = 196), with an average age of 20.9 ± 3.3 years. Alcohol consumption was evaluated with the CAGE scale (α = 0.845); depressive symptoms with the CES-D scale (α = 0.910); suicidal ideation with the Beck scale (α = 0.923); and self-esteem with the Rosenberg test (α = 0.923).

Effects of lifestyle behaviours and depressed mood on sleep quality in young adults. A machine learning approach,Sanchez-Trigo H.,2024,Psychology and Health,"Background: Modern lifestyles may lead to high stress levels, frequently associated with mood disorders (e.g. depressed mood) and sleep disturbance. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning model aimed at identifying risk factors for developing poor sleep quality in young adults. Material and methods: The sample consisted of 383 college-aged students (mean age ± SD: 21 ± 1 years; 61% males). Sleep quality, mood state, physical activity, number of sitting hours, and smartphone use were measured. Results: A decision tree algorithm distinguished participants’ sleep quality with 74% accuracy using a combination of four features: depressed mood, physical activity, sitting time, and vigour. Together with depressed mood, both physical activity (>6432 metabolic equivalent tasks -METs- per week) and sedentary behaviour (sitting time greater than 7 h/day) were the primary features that could differentiate those with poor sleep quality from those with good sleep quality. Conclusions: We provided a decision tree model with a sensitivity of 90.7% and a specificity of 54.3%, with an AUC of 0.725. These findings could promote improvements in prevention strategies and contribute to the development of meaningful and evidence-based intervention programs.",10.1080/08870446.2022.2067331,3,Scopus,85129227361,2-s2.0-85129227361,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129227361
VRAIlexia project: Provide customized support to university students with dyslexia using Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality,Zingoni A.,2024,2024 IEEE International Conference on Metrology for Extended Reality Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering Metroxraine 2024 Proceedings,"Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that af-fects around 20% of the population in the world. Different cognitive abilities such as reading, spelling, attention, memory and phonological awareness are negatively impacted by it. These difficulties can significantly influence the learning path of the students and can, in turn, lower their self-esteem or induce depression. Therefore, support methodologies are of utmost importance to help dyslexic students in ameliorating their difficulties. Today, it is possible to leverage two promising technologies that can help in this task, that is, Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality. In light of this, we have designed VRAIlexia, a framework in which these two methodologies are used to support dyslexic students with personalized digital tools and learning strategies that can ameliorate the difficulties encountered during their learning path.",10.1109/MetroXRAINE62247.2024.10796149,3,Scopus,85216107329,2-s2.0-85216107329,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216107329
AudioInsight: Detecting Social Contexts Relevant to Social Anxiety from Speech,Reddy V.,2024,Proceedings 2024 12th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Acii 2024,"During social interactions, understanding the in-tricacies of the context can be vital, particularly for socially anxious individuals. While previous research has found that the presence of a social interaction can be detected from ambient audio, the nuances within social contexts, which influence how anxiety provoking interactions are, remain largely unexplored. As an alternative to traditional, burdensome methods like self-report, this study presents a novel approach that harnesses ambient audio segments to detect social threat contexts. We focus on two key dimensions: number of interaction partners (dyadic vs. group) and degree of evaluative threat (explicitly evaluative vs. not explicitly evaluative). Building on data from a Zoom-based social interaction study (N=52 college students, of whom the majority N = 45 are socially anxious), we employ deep learning methods to achieve strong detection performance. Under sample-wide 5-fold Cross Validation (CV), our model distinguished dyadic from group interactions with 90 % accuracy and detected evaluative threat at 83 %. Using a leave-one-group-out CV, accuracies were 82 % and 77 %, respectively. While our data are based on virtual interactions due to pandemic constraints, our method has the potential to extend to diverse real-world settings. This research underscores the potential of passive sensing and AI to differentiate intricate social contexts, and may ultimately advance the ability of context-aware digital interventions to offer personalized mental health support.",10.1109/ACII63134.2024.00011,2,Scopus,105004790922,2-s2.0-105004790922,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004790922

Leveraging Social Media to Predict COVID-19-Induced Disruptions to Mental Well-Being Among University Students: Modeling Study,Das Swain V.,2024,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Large-scale crisis events such as COVID-19 often have secondary impacts on individuals' mental well-being. University students are particularly vulnerable to such impacts. Traditional survey-based methods to identify those in need of support do not scale over large populations and they do not provide timely insights. We pursue an alternative approach through social media data and machine learning. Our models aim to complement surveys and provide early, precise, and objective predictions of students disrupted by COVID-19. Objective: This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of language on private social media as an indicator of crisis-induced disruption to mental well-being. Methods: We modeled 4124 Facebook posts provided by 43 undergraduate students, spanning over 2 years. We extracted temporal trends in the psycholinguistic attributes of their posts and comments. These trends were used as features to predict how COVID-19 disrupted their mental well-being. Results: The social media-enabled model had an F1-score of 0.79, which was a 39% improvement over a model trained on the self-reported mental state of the participant. The features we used showed promise in predicting other mental states such as anxiety, depression, social, isolation, and suicidal behavior (F1-scores varied between 0.85 and 0.93). We also found that selecting the windows of time 7 months after the COVID-19-induced lockdown presented better results, therefore, paving the way for data minimization. Conclusions: We predicted COVID-19-induced disruptions to mental well-being by developing a machine learning model that leveraged language on private social media. The language in these posts described psycholinguistic trends in students' online behavior. These longitudinal trends helped predict mental well-being disruption better than models trained on correlated mental health questionnaires. Our work inspires further research into the potential applications of early, precise, and automatic warnings for individuals concerned about their mental health in times of crisis.",10.2196/52316,7,Scopus,85199774330,2-s2.0-85199774330,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199774330

Beyond the Scoreboard: A Machine Learning Investigation of Online Games' Influence on Jordanian University Students' Grades,Alshraideh M.,2024,Applied Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing,"In the latter part of the 21st century, the prevalence of online games has significantly increased, encompassing titles connected to the Internet via smart devices, enabling multiplayer interaction. Recent media attention has shed light on the adverse effects associated with online gaming. This research paper explores the viewpoints of 4,700 university students in Jordan regarding the physical, psychological, and behavioural impacts of Internet games. Additionally, it predicts how these impacts may affect the academic performance of 1,410 students. To analyze student trends and forecast outcomes based on sustained game engagement, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was specifically developed for the neural network. The findings revealed student consensus with recommended university measures to limit online game usage, emphasizing a prevalent belief in the negative influence of games on the body, behaviour, and mental health. In terms of the prediction process, the training data encompassed 60%, 70%, and 80% of the dataset. The results revealed that the highest accuracy, 96.69%, was achieved at the 70% threshold for predicting students' grade point average (GPA). The analysis suggested that projecting a decrease in the percentage of hours dedicated to playing online games could act as a mitigating factor to prevent GPA decline. Consequently, the system advises a range from 99.9% to 4.1%. This implies that a student with a maximum of 99.9% is encouraged to significantly reduce playing hours to preserve their GPA, while a student with a minimum of 4.1% is recommended to decrease playing hours by 4.1%. On average, for the 1,090 students, the system proposes a 48.36% reduction in playing hours to safeguard their GPAs and mitigate potential risks. This high level of accuracy played a crucial role in forecasting students' GPA outcomes following a year of sustained daily engagement with online games. Notably, the results unveiled a concerning revelation that 80% of students would face a detrimental impact on their academic performance after one year of such consistent online game involvement.",10.1155/2024/1337725,7,Scopus,85183644758,2-s2.0-85183644758,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183644758
Uncovering Patterns of Depression in Engineering and Medical Students Using Machine Learning,Agarwala S.,2024,Peeiacon 2024 International Conference on Power Electrical Electronics and Industrial Applications,"This paper presents a study on the evaluation of mental health challenges faced by engineering and medical students in Bangladesh, utilizing advanced machine learning and statistical methods. Data were collected through comprehensive questionnaires, focusing on socio-demographic, academic, and mental health variables. The dataset, including responses from 834 students, was preprocessed and split into two subsets: one for medical students and another for engineering students. The study utilized Student's T-Test and Fisher's Exact Test to identify 16 key features associated with mental health challenges. Following feature selection, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used to evaluate the impact of these features on depression prediction. The evaluation metrics included accuracy, ROC AUC, precision, recall, and F1 score, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the models' performance. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this research seeks to uncover patterns and predictors of depression that traditional studies often overlook.

Choosing the right treatment - combining clinicians’ expert knowledge with data-driven predictions,Maekawa E.,2024,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Context: This study proposes a Bayesian network model to aid mental health specialists making data-driven decisions on suitable treatments. The aim is to create a probabilistic machine learning model to assist psychologists in selecting the most suitable treatment for individuals for four potential mental disorders: Depression, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, or Specific Phobia. Methods: This study utilized a dataset from 1,094 individuals in Denmark containing socio-demographic details and mental health information. A Bayesian network was initially employed in a purely data-driven approach and was later refined with expert knowledge, referred to as a hybrid model. The model outputted probabilities for each disorder, with the highest probability indicating the most suitable disorder for treatment. Results: By incorporating expert knowledge, the model demonstrated enhanced performance compared to a strictly data-driven approach. Specifically, it achieved an AUC score of 0.85 vs 0.80 on the test data. Furthermore, we evaluated some cases where the predictions of the model did not match the actual treatment. The symptom questionnaires indicated that these participants likely had comorbid disorders, with the actual treatment being proposed by the model with the second highest probability. Conclusions: In 90.1% of cases, the hybrid model ranked the actual disorder treated as either the highest (67.3%) or second-highest (22.8%) on the test data. This emphasizes that instead of suggesting a single disorder to be treated, the model can offer the probabilities for multiple disorders. This allows individuals seeking treatment or their therapists to incorporate this information as an additional data-driven factor when collectively deciding on which treatment to prioritize.",10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1422587,0,Scopus,85204204783,2-s2.0-85204204783,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204204783
Re-visiting the past in search for silver-lining: Moroccan students’ perceptions of technology-mediated faculty practices under COVID-19,Zyad H.,2024,Journal of North African Studies,"Despite the wide-ranging research on technology-mediated learning, which has contributed immensely to a better understanding of how best it can be implemented, lockdowns during COVID-19 times have revived debates on teacher preparedness to adequately engage in this modality of instruction. Research-validated evidence has shown that a complex combination of technology, pedagogy and content is necessary for impactful teaching practices. Thus, the present paper reports on a qualitative study that investigated students’ perceptions of their teachers’ performance during the lockdown period. Online interviews and focus groups were conducted with a cohort of 30 university students. The students were selected by means of purposeful sampling informed by a set of pre-defined criteria. Overall, the students reported that most of their teachers utilised asynchronous teaching modalities. Also of interest was the finding that a small proportion of faculty varied the instructional deliverable with a clear intent to cater for a wider spectrum of student learning pace and style. Under COVID-19, additionally, distance education was hugely crippled by student psychological ill-being. One of the implications of these findings, among others, is the pressing need, now more than ever, for comprehensive and intensive teacher professional programs focused on technology-enhanced methodology.",10.1080/13629387.2022.2144253,0,Scopus,85142400209,2-s2.0-85142400209,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142400209
Scalable Technology for Adolescents and Youth to Reduce Stress in the Treatment of Common Mental Disorders in Jordan: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Akhtar A.,2024,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Young people in low- and middle-income countries encounter significant barriers to accessing mental health support due to various factors, including a substantial treatment gap and limited health care budgets allocated to mental health. Using innovative strategies, such as scalable digital self-help psychological interventions, offers a potential solution for improving access to mental health support. However, digital mental health interventions come with their own set of challenges, including issues related to low user engagement. Chatbots, with their interactive and engaging nature, may present a promising avenue for the delivery of these interventions. Objective: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of a newly developed World Health Organization (WHO) digital mental health intervention, titled Scalable Technology for Adolescents and Youth to Reduce Stress (STARS). Methods: A single-blind, 2-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted nationally across Jordan. Participants will include 344 young adults, aged 18-21 years, currently residing in Jordan. Inclusion criteria are heightened levels of psychological distress as determined through the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (≥20). Assessment measures will be conducted at baseline, 1-week post intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Following baseline assessments, eligible participants will be randomized to receive STARS or enhanced usual care. The primary outcomes are the reduction of symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Checklist, 25 subscales) at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include general functioning (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0), well-being (WHO-5 Well-Being Index), personal problems (Psychological Outcomes Profile), and agency (State Hope Scale subscale).

Reducing Alcohol Misuse and Promoting Treatment Initiation Among Veterans Through a Brief Internet-Based Intervention: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Pedersen E.R.,2024,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Young adult veterans who served after the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 (ie, post-9/11) are at heightened risk for experiencing behavioral health distress and disorders including hazardous drinking, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression. These veterans often face significant barriers to behavioral health treatment, and reaching them through brief mobile phone–based interventions may help reduce drinking and promote treatment engagement. Objective: Following a successful pilot study, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to further test the efficacy of a brief (ie, single session) mobile phone–delivered personalized normative feedback intervention enhanced with content to promote treatment engagement. Methods: We will conduct an RCT with 800 post-9/11 young adult veterans (aged 18 to 40 years) with potentially hazardous drinking and who have not recently received treatment for any behavioral health problems. Participants will be randomly assigned to the personalized intervention or a control condition with resources for seeking care. The personalized normative feedback module in the intervention focuses on the correction of misperceived norms of peer alcohol use and uses empirically informed approaches to increase motivation to address alcohol use and co-occurring behavioral health problems. Past 30-day drinking, alcohol-related consequences, and treatment-seeking behaviors will be assessed at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post intervention. Sex, barriers to care, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and severity of alcohol use disorder symptoms will be explored as potential moderators of outcomes. Results: We expect recruitment to be completed within 6 months, with data collection taking 12 months for each enrolled participant. Analyses will begin within 3 months of the final data collection point (ie, 12 months follow-up). Conclusions: This RCT will evaluate the efficacy of a novel intervention for non–treatment-seeking veterans who struggle with hazardous drinking and possible co-occurring behavioral health problems. This intervention has the potential to improve veteran health outcomes and overcome significant barriers to treatment.",10.2196/59993,0,Scopus,85201906759,2-s2.0-85201906759,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201906759
Effects of technology-enhanced language learning on reducing EFL learners’ public speaking anxiety,Chen Y.c.,2024,Computer Assisted Language Learning,"Public speaking is considered the most anxiety-provoking speaking activity for English as a foreign language (EFL) learner. While traditional lecture-based classrooms hinder EFL learners’ constant practice and frequent interaction due to large class sizes and limited time, recent developments in technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automatic Speech Analysis, and Virtual Reality (VR), may enhance language learning by offering accessible and personalized learning experiences. This study aimed to investigate the effects of technology-enhanced learning on reducing EFL learners’ PSA. Thirty-three university students were divided into three groups and received either lecture-based, mobile-assisted, or VR-facilitated instruction for four weeks. The students’ perceived PSA levels were reduced in all three groups after their respective instruction, but only the VR-facilitated group reached statistical significance, and there were no differences in the three groups’ final oral performances. However, the two technology-enhanced language learning (TELL) groups achieved more convergent performances on the Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety scale compared with the non-TELL group, which indicated that the impact of individual differences may have been compensated by technology assistance. The findings suggested that the instructional feedback generated by AI decreased the participants’ PSA, although the irreplaceable role of teachers as facilitators was also emphasized, while the potential of using VR in teaching public speaking was evident.",10.1080/09588221.2022.2055083,91,Scopus,85131179539,2-s2.0-85131179539,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131179539

The Impact of Voice Design on User Perception: A Case Study of Campus Counseling Voice Services,Chang T.C.,2024,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"With the development of artificial intelligence technology, voice AI was applied in various fields because of its ability to simulate human voice dialogue. In Taiwan, the mental health of college students has received increasing attention, but campus counseling is rarely studied. Therefore, this study is based on Kansei Engineering and aims to explore the impact of voice characteristics on users ‘perceptions to guide the development of campus consultation voice AI services. This study was designed for four experimental conditions: voice gender (male, female) and pitch (high-pitch, low-pitch). Participants evaluated the sample’s likeability and perceived safety through an online questionnaire. Sixty-eight questionnaires were collected. The results show that voice gender and pitch significantly impact participant’s perception. Male voices and higher pitches increase likeability and perceived safety; gender significantly impacts likeability and perceived safety; pitch has a more substantial effect on likeability and less on perceived safety. This study provides a direction for developing campus counseling voice design. It is recommended that future developers should choose male voices to improve users’ favorability and sense of security. At the same time, the acceptance of voice AI by different groups of people and the relationship between voice features and context can be further studied to improve the effectiveness and reliability of services.",10.1007/978-981-97-9910-7_8,0,Scopus,85210228466,2-s2.0-85210228466,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210228466

Mental Health and Mobile Communication Profiles of Crowdsourced Participants,Tlachac M.L.,2024,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are highly prevalent and burdensome. To increase mental health screening rates, the digital health research community has been exploring the ability to augment self reporting instruments with digital logs. Crowdsourced workers are being increasingly recruited for behavioral health research studies as demographically representative samples are desired for later translational applications. Overshadowed by predictive modeling, descriptive modeling has the ability to expand knowledge and understanding of the clinical generalizability of models trained on data from crowdsourced participants. In this study, we identify mobile communication profiles of a crowdsourced sample. To achieve this, we cluster features derived from time series of call and text logs. The psychiatric, behavioral, and demographic characteristics were notably different across the four identified mobile communication profiles. For example, the profile that had the lowest average depression and anxiety screening scores only shared incoming text logs. This cluster had statistically significantly different depression and anxiety screening scores in comparison to the cluster that shared the most outgoing text logs. These profiles expose important insights regarding the generalizability of crowdsourced samples to more general clinical populations and increase understanding regarding the limitations of crowdsourced samples for translational mental health research.",10.1109/JBHI.2024.3436654,2,Scopus,85200236353,2-s2.0-85200236353,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200236353
Attention-Based Explainable AI for Wearable Multivariate Data: A Case Study on Affect Status Prediction,Wang Y.,2024,2024 IEEE 20th International Conference on Body Sensor Networks Bsn 2024 Proceedings,"Wearable technology enables ubiquitous health monitoring where multivariate physiological and behavioral data can be captured over time. Such multivariate time series (MTS) data in healthcare applications needs technique to interpret the analysis results. However, existing deep learning models for MTS data analysis often lack interpretability, and current explainable AI (xAI) techniques fail to capture the temporal and inter-variable complexities inherent in MTS. This hinders the trust and integration of these AI-based systems in clinical decision-making. In this paper, we propose an attention-based xAI method to classify and interpret MTS data collected from wearable devices. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms and graph attention layers (GAT) to capture both temporal and inter-variable dependencies, providing interpretability at both the temporal and modality levels. We evaluate our method using a longitudinal affect status monitoring. The dataset was collected from 21 college students via wearable devices over one year. We train separate models for positive (PA) and negative affect (NA) prediction, and compare their performance with a Transformer-based method. Our method achieves robust classification performance, with 78.62% accuracy for PA and 76.30% for NA, while offering transparent explanations of its decisions. These findings highlight the potential of our xAI method for reliable and interpretable MTS classification in healthcare applications.",10.1109/BSN63547.2024.10780702,1,Scopus,85215095879,2-s2.0-85215095879,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215095879
Automatic Depression Detection Among Higher Education Students Based on DeepFM,Ruan Z.,2024,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,"Depressive disorder has become a common problem among higher education students, but it often gets undiagnosed and untreated due to unrecognized symptoms, poor access to medical resources, and fear of stigma. To improve the situation, automatic depression detection would be essential. In this article, we explore the feasibility of depression detection in higher education students using their behavioral data automatically collected by the university system. First, a DeepFM network, which can not only take discrete-continuous mixed features as its input but also can learn linear and nonlinear relations between the input and the output, is presented for depression detection. A modified focal loss (MFL) function is then proposed to alleviate data imbalance impact caused by the fact that the proportion of healthy students outweighs those diagnosed with depression significantly. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, behavioral data from 3218 students were collected, of which 179 were diagnosed with depression by university psychologists using PHQ-9 scale scores. Fivefold cross validations are performed, and the experiment results have illustrated that DeepFM obtains the highest average accuracy compared with multilayer perceptron (MLP), factorization neural network (FNN), and product-based neural network (PNN), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework for depression detection among university students.",10.1109/TIM.2024.3413175,9,Scopus,85196119656,2-s2.0-85196119656,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196119656
Student Mental Health Screening with Text Message Metadata,Tlachac M.L.,2024,Proceedings 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications Icmla 2024,"Passive mental health screening can facilitate earlier detection and treatment of mental illnesses. Text log distribution features have previously proven promising for mental illness screening, providing detailed information regarding communication patterns while maintaining user privacy.

Participants were asked about their experience receiving a digital data dashboard in psychotherapy via closed- and open-ended questions. We calculated descriptive statistics for closed-ended questions and conducted qualitative coding via NVivo (version 10; Lumivero) and natural language processing using the machine learning tool latent Dirichlet allocation to analyze open-ended questions. Results: Of 100 participants, nearly half (n=48, 49%) described their experience with the dashboard as “positive,” while the other half noted a “neutral” experience. Responses to the open-ended questions resulted in three thematic areas (nine subcategories): (1) dashboard experience (positive, neutral or negative, and comfortable); (2) perception of the dashboard’s impact on enhancing therapy (accountability, increased awareness over time, and objectivity); and (3) dashboard refinements (additional sources, tailored content, and privacy). Conclusions: Patients reported that receiving their digital data helped them stay “accountable,” while therapists indicated that the dashboard helped “tailor treatment plans.” Patient and therapist surveys provided important feedback on their experience regularly discussing dashboards in psychotherapy.",10.2196/59785,0,Scopus,85215554357,2-s2.0-85215554357,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215554357

"Automated Speech Analysis for Risk Detection of Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, and Fatigue: Algorithm Development and Validation Study",Riad R.,2024,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: While speech analysis holds promise for mental health assessment, research often focuses on single symptoms, despite symptom co-occurrences and interactions. In addition, predictive models in mental health do not properly assess the limitations of speech-based systems, such as uncertainty, or fairness for a safe clinical deployment. Objective: We investigated the predictive potential of mobile-collected speech data for detecting and estimating depression, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia, focusing on other factors than mere accuracy, in the general population. Methods: We included 865 healthy adults and recorded their answers regarding their perceived mental and sleep states. We asked how they felt and if they had slept well lately. Clinically validated questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue severity were also used. We developed a novel speech and machine learning pipeline involving voice activity detection, feature extraction, and model training. We automatically modeled speech with pretrained deep learning models that were pretrained on a large, open, and free database, and we selected the best one on the validation set. Based on the best speech modeling approach, clinical threshold detection, individual score prediction, model uncertainty estimation, and performance fairness across demographics (age, sex, and education) were evaluated. We used a train-validation-test split for all evaluations: to develop our models, select the best ones, and assess the generalizability of held-out data. Results: The best model was Whisper M with a max pooling and oversampling method. Our methods achieved good detection performance for all symptoms, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9: area under the curve [AUC]=0.76; F<inf>1</inf>-score=0.49 and Beck Depression Inventory: AUC=0.78; F<inf>1</inf>-score=0.65), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale: AUC=0.77; F<inf>1</inf>-score=0.50), insomnia (Athens Insomnia Scale: AUC=0.73; F<inf>1</inf>-score=0.62), and fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory total score: AUC=0.68; F<inf>1</inf>-score=0.88). The system performed well when it needed to abstain from making predictions, as demonstrated by low abstention rates in depression detection with the Beck Depression Inventory and fatigue, with risk-coverage AUCs below 0.4. Individual symptom scores were accurately predicted (correlations were all significant with Pearson strengths between 0.31 and 0.49). Fairness analysis revealed that models were consistent for sex (average disparity ratio [DR] 0.86, SD 0.13), to a lesser extent for education level (average DR 0.47, SD 0.30), and worse for age groups (average DR 0.33, SD 0.30). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of speech-based systems for multifaceted mental health assessment in the general population, not only for detecting clinical thresholds but also for estimating their severity. Addressing fairness and incorporating uncertainty estimation with selective classification are key contributions that can enhance the clinical utility and responsible implementation of such systems.",10.2196/58572,4,Scopus,85208022906,2-s2.0-85208022906,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208022906
Factors Associated With Surveillance Testing in Individuals With COVID-19 Symptoms During the Last Leg of the Pandemic: Multivariable Regression Analysis,Dotson T.,2024,Jmir Public Health and Surveillance,"Background: Rural underserved areas facing health disparities have unequal access to health resources. By the third and fourth waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States, COVID-19 testing had reduced, with more reliance on home testing, and those seeking testing were mostly symptomatic. Objective: This study identifies factors associated with COVID-19 testing among individuals who were symptomatic versus asymptomatic seen at a Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics for Underserved Populations phase 2 (RADx-UP2) testing site in West Virginia. Methods: Demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors were collected via survey from tested individuals. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the presence of individuals who were symptomatic seen at testing sites. Global tests for spatial autocorrelation were conducted to examine clustering in the proportion of symptomatic to total individuals tested by zip code. Bivariate maps were created to display geographic distributions between higher proportions of tested individuals who were symptomatic and social determinants of health. Results: Among predictors, the presence of a physical (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.3-2.65) or mental (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 0.96-2.48) comorbid condition, challenges related to a place to stay/live (aOR 307.13, 95% CI 1.46-10,6372), no community socioeconomic distress (aOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1.00), no challenges in getting needed medicine (aOR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00-0.82) or transportation (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.64), an interaction between community socioeconomic distress and not getting needed medicine (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.13), and having no community socioeconomic distress while not facing challenges related to a place to stay/live (aOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.99) were statistically associated with an individual being symptomatic at the first test visit. Conclusions: This study addresses critical limitations to the current COVID-19 testing literature, which almost exclusively uses population-level disease screening data to inform public health responses.",10.2196/52762,1,Scopus,85199239443,2-s2.0-85199239443,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199239443
Using Large Language Models to Detect Depression From User-Generated Diary Text Data as a Novel Approach in Digital Mental Health Screening: Instrument Validation Study,Shin D.,2024,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Depressive disorders have substantial global implications, leading to various social consequences, including decreased occupational productivity and a high disability burden. Early detection and intervention for clinically significant depression have gained attention; however, the existing depression screening tools, such as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, have limitations in objectivity and accuracy. Therefore, researchers are identifying objective indicators of depression, including image analysis, blood biomarkers, and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). Among EMAs, user-generated text data, particularly from diary writing, have emerged as a clinically significant and analyzable source for detecting or diagnosing depression, leveraging advancements in large language models such as ChatGPT. Objective: We aimed to detect depression based on user-generated diary text through an emotional diary writing app using a large language model (LLM). We aimed to validate the value of the semistructured diary text data as an EMA data source. Methods: Participants were assessed for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire and suicide risk was evaluated using the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation before starting and after completing the 2-week diary writing period. The text data from the daily diaries were also used in the analysis. The performance of leading LLMs, such as ChatGPT with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, was assessed with and without GPT-3.5 fine-tuning on the training data set. The model performance comparison involved the use of chain-of-thought and zero-shot prompting to analyze the text structure and content. Results: We used 428 diaries from 91 participants; GPT-3.5 fine-tuning demonstrated superior performance in depression detection, achieving an accuracy of 0.902 and a specificity of 0.955. However, the balanced accuracy was the highest (0.844) for GPT-3.5 without fine-tuning and prompt techniques; it displayed a recall of 0.929. Conclusions: Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 demonstrated relatively reasonable performance in recognizing the risk of depression based on diaries. Our findings highlight the potential clinical usefulness of user-generated text data for detecting depression. In addition to measurable indicators, such as step count and physical activity, future research should increasingly emphasize qualitative digital expression.",10.2196/54617,16,Scopus,85204480910,2-s2.0-85204480910,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204480910
AI Chatbot for Depression Self-Help,Kumar S.,2024,Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Emphasis on Diabetes Hypertension and Depression Management,"Depression is common among young adults, aggravated by the problems of the COVID-19 pandemic, but mental health treatments are few. This study explores the conceptualization, creation, and utilization of an AI chatbot specifically designed for the purpose of assisting individuals in managing their depression. Depression, a prevalent mental health concern, poses considerable obstacles in terms of identification, treatment, and availability of assistance. This chapter addresses those issues by examining the design, implementation, and ethical consideration associated with AI chatbots that provide valuable support to people who are experiencing depression. The conversation design of this chatbot places a strong emphasis on empathy, compassion, and non-judgmental interactions and discusses evidence-based depression information, including symptoms, causes, and treatments. This chapter presents the clinical performance and usefulness of Tess, XiaoNan, and XiaoE, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT–based AI chatbots for depressive adults. These chatbots provide a realistic and engaging digital therapy strategy that is accessible and self-guided for depression. The significance of continuous improvement, which allows the chatbot to undergo development through user feedback and the latest advancements in depression treatment and AI technology, is also explored in this chapter.",10.1201/9781003522096-14,0,Scopus,85209001144,2-s2.0-85209001144,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85209001144
Effectiveness of a Web-based and Mobile Therapy Chatbot on Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in Subclinical Young Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial,Karkosz S.,2024,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: There has been an increased need to provide specialized help for people with depressive and anxiety symptoms, particularly teenagers and young adults. There is evidence from a 2-week intervention that chatbots (eg, Woebot) are effective in reducing depression and anxiety, an effect that was not detected in the control group that was provided self-help materials. Although chatbots are a promising solution, there is limited scientific evidence for the efficacy of agent-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) outside the English language, especially for highly inflected languages. Objective: This study aimed to measure the efficacy of Fido, a therapy chatbot that uses the Polish language. It targets depressive and anxiety symptoms using CBT techniques. We hypothesized that participants using Fido would show a greater reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms than the control group. Methods: We conducted a 2-arm, open-label, randomized controlled trial with 81 participants with subclinical depression or anxiety who were recruited via social media. Participants were divided into experimental (interacted with a fully automated Fido chatbot) and control (received a self-help book) groups. Both intervention methods addressed topics such as general psychoeducation and cognitive distortion identification and modification via Socratic questioning. The chatbot also featured suicidal ideation identification and redirection to suicide hotlines. We used self-assessment scales to measure primary outcomes, including the levels of depression, anxiety, worry tendencies, satisfaction with life, and loneliness at baseline, after the 2-week intervention and at the 1-month follow-up. We also controlled for secondary outcomes, including engagement and frequency of use. Results: There were no differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms between the groups at enrollment and baseline. After the intervention, depressive and anxiety symptoms were reduced in both groups (chatbot: n=36; control: n=38), which remained stable at the 1-month follow-up. Loneliness was not significantly different between the groups after the intervention, but an exploratory analysis showed a decline in loneliness among participants who used Fido more frequently. Both groups used their intervention technique with similar frequency; however, the control group spent more time (mean 117.57, SD 72.40 minutes) on the intervention than the Fido group (mean 79.44, SD 42.96 minutes). Conclusions: We did not replicate the findings from previous (eg, Woebot) studies, as both arms yielded therapeutic effects. However, such results are in line with other research of Internet interventions. Nevertheless, Fido provided sufficient help to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms and decreased perceived loneliness among high-frequency users, which is one of the first pieces of evidence of chatbot efficacy with agents that use a highly inflected language. Further research is needed to determine the long-term, real-world effectiveness of Fido and its efficacy in a clinical sample.",10.2196/47960,19,Scopus,85191226596,2-s2.0-85191226596,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191226596
The Value of a Virtual Assistant to Improve Engagement in Computerized Cognitive Training at Home: Exploratory Study,Zsoldos I.,2024,Jmir Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies,"Background: Impaired cognitive function is observed in many pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. At present, the pharmaceutical treatments available to counter cognitive decline have only modest effects, with significant side effects. A nonpharmacological treatment that has received considerable attention is computerized cognitive training (CCT), which aims to maintain or improve cognitive functioning through repeated practice in standardized exercises. CCT allows for more regular and thorough training of cognitive functions directly at home, which represents a significant opportunity to prevent and fight cognitive decline. However, the presence of assistance during training seems to be an important parameter to improve patients’ motivation and adherence to treatment. To compensate for the absence of a therapist during at-home CCT, a relevant option could be to include a virtual assistant to accompany patients throughout their training. Objective: The objective of this exploratory study was to evaluate the interest of including a virtual assistant to accompany patients during CCT. We investigated the relationship between various individual factors (eg, age, psycho-affective functioning, personality, personal motivations, and cognitive skills) and the appreciation and usefulness of a virtual assistant during CCT. This study is part of the THERADIA (Thérapies Digitales Augmentées par l’Intelligence Artificielle) project, which aims to develop an empathetic virtual assistant. Methods: A total of 104 participants were recruited, including 52 (50%) young adults (mean age 21.2, range 18 to 27, SD 2.9 years) and 52 (50%) older adults (mean age 67.9, range 60 to 79, SD 5.1 years). All participants were invited to the laboratory to answer several questionnaires and perform 1 CCT session, which consisted of 4 cognitive exercises supervised by a virtual assistant animated by a human pilot via the Wizard of Oz method. The participants evaluated the virtual assistant and CCT at the end of the session. Results: Analyses were performed using the Bayesian framework. The results suggest that the virtual assistant was appreciated and perceived as useful during CCT in both age groups. However, older adults rated the assistant and CCT more positively overall than young adults. Certain characteristics of users, especially their current affective state (ie, arousal, intrinsic relevance, goal conduciveness, and anxiety state), appeared to be related to their evaluation of the session. Conclusions: This study provides, for the first time, insight into how young and older adults perceive a virtual assistant during CCT. The results suggest that such an assistant could have a beneficial influence on users’ motivation, provided that it can handle different situations, particularly their emotional state. The next step of our project will be to evaluate our device with patients experiencing mild cognitive impairment and to test its effectiveness in long-term cognitive training.",10.2196/48129,3,Scopus,85200454617,2-s2.0-85200454617,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200454617
Optimizing personalized psychological well-being interventions through digital phenotyping: results from a randomized non-clinical trial,Rocchi G.,2024,Frontiers in Psychology,"Background: Digital technologies, including smartphones, hold great promise for expanding mental health services and improving access to care. Digital phenotyping, which involves the collection of behavioral and physiological data using smartphones, offers a novel way to understand and monitor mental health. This study examines the feasibility of a psychological well-being program using a telegram-integrated chatbot for digital phenotyping. Methods: A one-month randomized non-clinical trial was conducted with 81 young adults aged 18–35 from Italy and the canton of Ticino, a region in southern Switzerland. Participants were randomized to an experimental group that interacted with a chatbot, or to a control group that received general information on psychological well-being. The chatbot collected real-time data on participants’ well-being such as user-chatbot interactions, responses to exercises, and emotional and behavioral metrics. A clustering algorithm created a user profile and content recommendation system to provide personalized exercises based on users’ responses. Results: Four distinct clusters of participants emerged, based on factors such as online alerts, social media use, insomnia, attention and energy levels. Participants in the experimental group reported improvements in well-being and found the personalized exercises, recommended by the clustering algorithm useful. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of a digital phenotyping-based well-being program using a chatbot. Despite limitations such as a small sample size and short study duration, the findings suggest that digital phenotyping and personalized recommendation systems could improve mental health care. Future research should include larger samples and longer follow-up periods to validate these findings and explore clinical applications.",10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1479269,0,Scopus,85215550965,2-s2.0-85215550965,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215550965
Innova4Health: an integrated approach for prevention of recurrence and personalized treatment of Major Depressive Disorder,Monaco F.,2024,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,"Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition characterized by persistent low mood, cognitive and physical symptoms, anhedonia (loss of interest in activities), and suicidal ideation. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts depression will become the leading cause of disability by 2030. While biological markers remain essential for understanding MDD's pathophysiology, recent advancements in social signal processing and environmental monitoring hold promise. Wearable technologies, including smartwatches and air purifiers with environmental sensors, can generate valuable digital biomarkers for depression assessment in real-world settings. Integrating these with existing physical, psychopathological, and other indices (autoimmune, inflammatory, neuroradiological) has the potential to improve MDD recurrence prevention strategies. Methods: This prospective, randomized, interventional, and non-pharmacological integrated study aims to evaluate digital and environmental biomarkers in adolescents and young adults diagnosed with MDD who are currently taking medication. The study implements a sensor-integrated platform built around an open-source “Pothos” air purifier system. This platform is designed for scalability and integration with third-party devices. It accomplishes this through software interfaces, a dedicated app, sensor signal pre-processing, and an embedded deep learning AI system. The study will enroll two experimental groups (10 adolescents and 30 young adults each). Within each group, participants will be randomly allocated to Group A or Group B. Only Group B will receive the technological equipment (Pothos system and smartwatch) for collecting digital biomarkers. Blood and saliva samples will be collected at baseline (T0) and endpoint (T1) to assess inflammatory markers and cortisol levels. Results: Following initial age-based stratification, the sample will undergo detailed classification at the 6-month follow-up based on remission status. Digital and environmental biomarker data will be analyzed to explore intricate relationships between these markers, depression symptoms, disease progression, and early signs of illness. Conclusion: This study seeks to validate an AI tool for enhancing early MDD clinical management, implement an AI solution for continuous data processing, and establish an AI infrastructure for managing healthcare Big Data. Integrating innovative psychophysical assessment tools into clinical practice holds significant promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and developing more specific digital devices for comprehensive mental health evaluation.",10.3389/frai.2024.1366055,2,Scopus,85193732057,2-s2.0-85193732057,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193732057
MoodMon: novel optimization of bipolar disorder monitoring through patient-driven voice parameter submission and AI technology,Sokół-Szawłowska M.,2024,Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii,"Purpose: Behavioral data collected from smartphones can assist artificial intelligence (AI) in assessing and predicting fluctuations in mental states in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In Poland, the MoodMon online system is used to integrate passive and active data, including voice parameters, for analysis and the issue of alerts based on changes in individual’s mental state. The study aims to explore whether active engagement of the patient enhances the efficacy of the advanced MoodMon tool. This clinical trial is embedded in a broader research initiative. Methods: Methodologically, smartphones were used to automatically collect daily activity data from wristbands and phones of 75 BD patients. Clinical evaluations, using the Hamilton Depression and Young Mania Rating Scales were conducted via a web app, regular visits, calls, or system-initiated contacts after alerts. The MoodMon system, trained on patient data, was compared against clinical evaluations, successfully predicting mental states. Results: Results showed high alert accuracy: true positive ratio (TPR) at 86.6% (sensitivity) and true negative ratio (TNR) at 98.59% (specificity). Active patient voice data submissions notably improved the prediction of changes or stability in mental states. Conclusions: Active patient participation in data submission enhances MoodMon’s effectiveness as an AI-driven monitoring tool for BD. This underscores the potential of behavioral markers and mobile health applications in mental health care.",10.5114/ppn.2024.147100,1,Scopus,85219069323,2-s2.0-85219069323,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219069323
Real-time monitoring to predict depressive symptoms: study protocol,Lee Y.R.,2024,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: According to the World Health Organization, Depression is the fourth leading cause of global disease burden. However, traditional clinical and self-report assessments of depression have limitations in providing timely diagnosis and intervention. Recently, digital phenotyping studies have found the possibility of overcoming these limitations through the use of wearable-devices and smartphones. The present study aims to identify the digital phenotype that significantly predicts depressive symptoms. Methods and analysis: The study will recruit a total of 150 participants in their 20s who have experienced depression for the past two weeks in Korea. The study will collect passive (eg., active energy, exercise minutes, heart rate, heart rate variability, resting energy, resting heart rate, sleep patterns, steps, walking pace) data and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) through smartphone and wearable-device for two weeks. This study will be conducted longitudinally, with two repeated measurements over three months. Passive data will be collected through sensors on the wearable-device, while EMA data will be collected four times a day through a smartphone app. A machine learning algorithm and multilevel model will be used to construct a predictive model for depressive symptoms using the collected data. Discussion: This study explores the potential of wearable devices and smartphones to improve the understanding and treatment of depression in young adults. By collecting continuous, real-time data on physiological and behavioral patterns, the research uncovers subtle changes in heart rate, activity levels and sleep that correlate with depressive symptoms, providing a deeper understanding of the disorder. The findings provide a foundation for further research and contribute to the advancement of digital mental health.

Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Suicidal Thinking in Adolescents by Derivation and Validation in 3 Independent Worldwide Cohorts: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,Kim H.,2024,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among adolescents and is associated with clusters of suicides. Despite numerous studies on this preventable cause of death, the focus has primarily been on single nations and traditional statistical methods. Objective: This study aims to develop a predictive model for adolescent suicidal thinking using multinational data sets and machine learning (ML). Methods: We used data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey with 566, 875 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years and conducted external validation using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey with 103, 874 adolescents and Norway's University National General Survey with 19, 574 adolescents. Several tree-based ML models were developed, and feature importance and Shapley additive explanations values were analyzed to identify risk factors for adolescent suicidal thinking. Results: When trained on the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey data from South Korea with a 95% CI, the XGBoost model reported an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 90.06% (95% CI 89.97-90.16), displaying superior performance compared to other models. For external validation using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey data from the United States and the University National General Survey from Norway, the XGBoost model achieved AUROCs of 83.09% and 81.27%, respectively. Across all data sets, XGBoost consistently outperformed the other models with the highest AUROC score, and was selected as the optimal model. In terms of predictors of suicidal thinking, feelings of sadness and despair were the most influential, accounting for 57.4% of the impact, followed by stress status at 19.8%. This was followed by age (5.7%), household income (4%), academic achievement (3.4%), sex (2.1%), and others, which contributed less than 2% each. Conclusions: This study used ML by integrating diverse data sets from 3 countries to address adolescent suicide. The findings highlight the important role of emotional health indicators in predicting suicidal thinking among adolescents. Specifically, sadness and despair were identified as the most significant predictors, followed by stressful conditions and age. These findings emphasize the critical need for early diagnosis and prevention of mental health issues during adolescence.",10.2196/55913,19,Scopus,85193461052,2-s2.0-85193461052,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193461052

A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting Mental Disorders,Sneha ,2024,2024 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computation Communication and Information Technology Icaiccit 2024,"Mental disorders include a range of psychiatric diseases, involving stress, trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), neurocognitive disorders, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), substance-addictive disorder, bipolar disorder, neurodevelopmental disorder, schizophrenia, and sexual dysfunctions. These are related to unfavorable health behaviors like disturbed sleeping patterns, poor diet, poverty, unemployment, some unusual life events, and higher addiction rates. Of late, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders are ruling the world and have become more prominent among the youth belonging to high-income nations. Depression is the most common disease in clinical practice, leading to occupational, social, interpersonal, and financial problems.

New Technology for Intelligent Analysis of Physiological Data for the Development of Medical Applications in Psychiatry,Demin S.,2024,2024 10th International Conference on Information Technology and Nanotechnology Itnt 2024,"In this work, we propose a new technology for the intelligent analysis of complex physiological signals generated by different areas of the human cerebral cortex, with the aim of subsequently developing medical applications in psychiatry. The search for diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum diseases is carried out within the framework of Flicker-Noise Spectroscopy from electroencephalograms of two groups of subjects: healthy subjects and children/adolescents with varying degrees of manifestation of mental disorders. In the course of studying the dynamic and spectral characteristics, as well as the effects of synchronization of electroencephalograms, we established classification parameters that can be used to implement machine learning algorithms in automated systems for the analysis and diagnosis of mental disorders. Moreover, these parameters consider the high degree of individuality inherent in biomedical and physiological signals generated by living organisms. The proposed solution will be of interest to specialists developing machine learning methods, applied artificial intelligence technologies in medical applications, as well as biophysics and physics of complex systems, in terms of digital processing of biomedical and physiological signals.",10.1109/ITNT60778.2024.10582326,0,Scopus,85199486199,2-s2.0-85199486199,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199486199
Understanding and comparing risk factors and subtypes in South Korean adult and adolescent women's suicidal ideation or suicide attempt using survey and social media data,Kim D.,2024,Digital Health,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the similarities and differences in risk factors for suicide among adult and adolescent women in South Korea and identify subtypes of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt in each group. Methods: Multifaceted data were collected and analyzed by linking survey and social media data. Interpretable machine learning models were constructed to predict suicide risk and major risk factors were extracted by investigating their feature importance. Additionally, subtypes of suicidal adult and adolescent women were identified and explained using risk factors. Results: The risk factors for adult women were primarily related to mental disorders, while those for adolescent women were primarily related to interpersonal experiences and needs. Two subtypes of suicidal adult women were one with high psychiatric symptoms and mental disorders of them and/or their families and the other with excessive social media use and high online victimization. Two subtypes of suicidal adolescent women were one with high psychiatric symptoms, high ACEs, and high social connectedness, and the other with frequent social media use, high online sexual victimization, and high social assurance.

Machine learning prediction of anxiety symptoms in social anxiety disorder: utilizing multimodal data from virtual reality sessions,Park J.H.,2024,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: Machine learning (ML) is an effective tool for predicting mental states and is a key technology in digital psychiatry. This study aimed to develop ML algorithms to predict the upper tertile group of various anxiety symptoms based on multimodal data from virtual reality (VR) therapy sessions for social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients and to evaluate their predictive performance across each data type. Methods: This study included 32 SAD-diagnosed individuals, and finalized a dataset of 132 samples from 25 participants. It utilized multimodal (physiological and acoustic) data from VR sessions to simulate social anxiety scenarios. This study employed extended Geneva minimalistic acoustic parameter set for acoustic feature extraction and extracted statistical attributes from time series-based physiological responses. We developed ML models that predict the upper tertile group for various anxiety symptoms in SAD using Random Forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost) models. The best parameters were explored through grid search or random search, and the models were validated using stratified cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: The CatBoost, using multimodal features, exhibited high performance, particularly for the Social Phobia Scale with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.852. It also showed strong performance in predicting cognitive symptoms, with the highest AUROC of 0.866 for the Post-Event Rumination Scale. For generalized anxiety, the LightGBM’s prediction for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-trait led to an AUROC of 0.819. In the same analysis, models using only physiological features had AUROCs of 0.626, 0.744, and 0.671, whereas models using only acoustic features had AUROCs of 0.788, 0.823, and 0.754. Conclusions: This study showed that a ML algorithm using integrated multimodal data can predict upper tertile anxiety symptoms in patients with SAD with higher performance than acoustic or physiological data obtained during a VR session. The results of this study can be used as evidence for personalized VR sessions and to demonstrate the strength of the clinical use of multimodal data.",10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1504190,3,Scopus,85215379179,2-s2.0-85215379179,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215379179
Analyze and Implement a Reinforced AI Chatbot in Guayaquil to Improve Mental Health in Adolescents with the Use of the Neural Generative Models,Wong Delacruz N.W.T.,2024,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Mental health is vital to the development of young adolescents to create strong relationships and resilience, keeping a positive influence on society. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is anticipated to be significant to the population, especially adolescents by depriving social contact and creating mental disorders. Currently, there are countless Chatbots that give dynamic chatbot services in health. In recent years, neural networks for natural language processing (NLP) have shown to generate more responses learned by the machine. This study aims to implement and compare two Chatbot mobile applications using Neural generative with sentiment models: OpenAI GPT-3 model, and personalized chatbot based on deep Learning, Transformer BERT, and TextBlob model. The dataset for this model was generated from a database of the flow conversation from GPT-3 and the trained bot, frequently asked questions collected at the beginning and end of the term of academic. To analyze, the sentiment it trains the dataset used in the conversation which validates the prediction through a confusion matrix which resulted in test accuracy frequently correct is 70% for Transformer Bert and 68% in TextBlob. To test the usability of the chatbot and application, a survey was conducted on a group of 30 participants, using Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) and Linkert scale, it showed that GPT-3 CUQ Mean is 77,71 higher than Deep Learning. As for the Linkert scale, it was verified that 68% of participants perceived that the chatbot was adequate to their concerns, as well that the acceptance rate was 90%.",10.1007/978-3-031-58956-0_5,0,Scopus,85195875986,2-s2.0-85195875986,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195875986
"Insights Derived From Text-Based Digital Media, in Relation to Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Systematic Review",Sweeney C.,2024,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Text-based digital media platforms have revolutionized communication and information sharing, providing valuable access to knowledge and understanding in the fields of mental health and suicide prevention. Objective: This systematic review aimed to determine how machine learning and data analysis can be applied to text-based digital media data to understand mental health and aid suicide prevention. Methods: A systematic review of research papers from the following major electronic databases was conducted: Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase (via MEDLINE), and PsycINFO (via MEDLINE). The database search was supplemented by a hand search using Google Scholar. Results: Overall, 19 studies were included, with five major themes as to how data analysis and machine learning techniques could be applied: (1) as predictors of personal mental health, (2) to understand how personal mental health and suicidal behavior are communicated, (3) to detect mental disorders and suicidal risk, (4) to identify help seeking for mental health difficulties, and (5) to determine the efficacy of interventions to support mental well-being. Conclusions: Our findings show that data analysis and machine learning can be used to gain valuable insights, such as the following: web-based conversations relating to depression vary among different ethnic groups, teenagers engage in a web-based conversation about suicide more often than adults, and people seeking support in web-based mental health communities feel better after receiving online support. Digital tools and mental health apps are being used successfully to manage mental health, particularly through the COVID-19 epidemic, during which analysis has revealed that there was increased anxiety and depression, and web-based communities played a part in reducing isolation during the pandemic. Predictive analytics were also shown to have potential, and virtual reality shows promising results in the delivery of preventive or curative care. Future research efforts could center on optimizing algorithms to enhance the potential of text-based digital media analysis in mental health and suicide prevention. In addressing depression, a crucial step involves identifying the factors that contribute to happiness and using machine learning to forecast these sources of happiness. This could extend to understanding how various activities result in improved happiness across different socioeconomic groups. Using insights gathered from such data analysis and machine learning, there is an opportunity to craft digital interventions, such as chatbots, designed to provide support and address mental health challenges and suicide prevention.",10.2196/55747,12,Scopus,85199346678,2-s2.0-85199346678,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199346678
Trends in South Korean Medical Device Development for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder: Narrative Review,Cho Y.,2024,Jmir Biomedical Engineering,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are among the most prevalent mental disorders among school-aged youth in South Korea and may play a role in the increasing pressures on teachers and school-based special education programming. A lack of support for special education; tensions between teachers, students, and parents; and limited backup for teacher absences are common complaints among Korean educators. New innovations in technology to screen and treat ADHD and ASD may offer relief to students, parents, and teachers through earlier and efficient diagnosis; access to treatment options; and ultimately, better-managed care and expectations. Objective: This narrative literature review provides an account of medical device use and development in South Korea for the diagnosis and management of ADHD and ASD and highlights research gaps. Methods: A narrative review was conducted across 4 databases (PubMed, Korean National Assembly Library, Scopus, and PsycINFO). Journal articles, dissertations, and government research and development reports were included if they discussed medical devices for ADHD and ASD. Only Korean or English papers were included. Resources were excluded if they did not correspond to the research objective or did not discuss at least 1 topic about medical devices for ADHD and ASD. Journal articles were excluded if they were not peer reviewed. Resources were limited to publications between 2013 and July 22, 2024. Results: A total of 1794 records about trends in Korean medical device development were categorized into 2 major groups: digital therapeutics and traditional therapy. Digital therapeutics resulted in 5 subgroups: virtual reality and artificial intelligence, machine learning and robot, gaming and visual contents, eye-feedback and movement intervention, and electroencephalography and neurofeedback. Traditional therapy resulted in 3 subgroups: cognitive behavioral therapy and working memory; diagnosis and rating scale; and musical, literary therapy, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. Digital therapeutics using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and electroencephalography technologies account for the biggest portions of development in South Korea, rather than traditional therapies. Most resources, 94.15% (1689/1794), were from the Korean National Assembly Library. Conclusions: Limitations include small sizes of populations to conclude findings in many articles, a lower number of articles discussing medical devices for ASD, and a majority of articles being dissertations. Emerging digital medical devices and those integrated with traditional therapies are important solutions to reducing the prevalence rates of ADHD and ASD in South Korea by promoting early diagnosis and intervention. Furthermore, their application will relieve pressures on teachers and school-based special education programming by providing direct supporting resources to students with ADHD or ASD. Future development of medical devices for ADHD and ASD is predicted to heavily rely on digital technologies, such as those that sense people’s behaviors, eye movement, and brainwaves.",10.2196/60399,1,Scopus,85219613642,2-s2.0-85219613642,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219613642

The Urgent Need for an Evidence-Based Digital Mental Health Practice Model of Care for Youth,Ridout B.,2024,Jmir Mental Health,"Australian providers of mental health services and support for young people include private and public allied health providers, government initiatives (eg, headspace), nongovernment organizations (eg, Kids Helpline), general practitioners (GPs), and the hospital system. Over 20 years of research has established that many young people prefer to seek mental health support online; however, clear client pathways within and between online and offline mental health services are currently lacking. The authors propose a Digital Mental Health Practice model of care for youth to assist with digital mental health service mapping. The proposed model offers accessible pathways for a client to engage with digital mental health services, provides clear navigation to access support for individual needs, and facilitates a seamless connection with offline mental health services using a transferable electronic health records system. This future-looking model also includes emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the metaverse, which must be accounted for as potential tools to be leveraged for digital therapies and support systems. The urgent need for a user-centered Digital Mental Health Practice model of care for youth in Australia is discussed, highlighting the shortcomings of traditional and existing online triage models evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the complex challenges that must be overcome, such as the integration of diverse mental health care providers and establishment of a robust electronic health records system. Potential benefits of such a model include reduced pressure on emergency rooms, improved identification of immediate needs, enhanced referral practices, and the establishment of a cost-efficient national digital mental health care model with global applicability. The authors conclude by stressing the consequences of inaction, warning that delays may lead to more complex challenges as new technologies emerge and exacerbate the long-term negative consequences of poor mental health management on the economic and biopsychosocial well-being of young Australians.",10.2196/48441,5,Scopus,85191778204,2-s2.0-85191778204,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191778204
From Pixels to Pain: The Silent Health Risk Associated with Electronic Device Use,Alamma B.H.,2024,8th IEEE International Conference on Computational System and Information Technology for Sustainable Solutions Csitss 2024,"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning is a subset that focuses on using data to learn and create prediction algorithms. Electronics controls the flow of electricity for processing, and health entails more than just being free from disease. On the other hand, overusing devices can increase health hazards. The inquiry consists of an empirical study that was carried out in Istanbul, Turkey, with 1147 students, as well as a systematic evaluation of ML applications in mental health within the human-computer interface (HCI) literature. The condition of emotional, psychological, and social well-being that affects a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviour in day-to-day living is known as mental health. The study examines how teens' mental and physical health are affected by their excessive use of digital gadgets, especially cellphones. In this artical the integration of digital technologies and machine learning (ML) in relation to teenage wellbeing and mental health treatment is examined. The assessment also emphasises the necessity of humancentered and morally sound machine learning applications in mental health services. It also discusses how machine learning (ML) might improve mental health services by improving the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health issues. The results show that teens' psychiatric problems, musculoskeletal discomfort, and sleep disruptions are linked to excessive digital device useThe study comes to the conclusion that while ML and digital technologies have a great deal of promise for enhancing mental health outcomes, there are also important socio-technical issues that require attention.

Artificial Intelligence-driven Solution for Prompt Identification of Mental Health Concerns in Adolescents,Panigrahi B.,2024,2024 IEEE 1st International Conference on Green Industrial Electronics and Sustainable Technologies Giest 2024,"Globally, adolescents' mental health is a major problem, and successful intervention and therapy depend heavily on early identification. In this research, we present the creation of an AI-based system to identify mental health problems in teenagers at an early age. In order to find possible symptoms of mental health issues, the system uses machine learning algorithms to examine data from a variety of sources, such as social media postings, text messages, and behavioral patterns. In order to extract mood, linguistic patterns, and semantic clues suggestive of psychological discomfort, the system incorporates natural language processing techniques. It also uses information from wearable technology and smartphone apps to track activity levels and physiological signs, giving parents a complete picture of their adolescent's health. Feature extraction, sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, and risk assessment algorithms are important parts of the AI system that work together to identify early warning indicators of mental health problems. To increase accuracy and generalization across various demographic groups and cultural situations, the system makes use of cutting-edge neural network designs that have been trained on a variety of datasets.

The Relationship Between the Mental Ill-Being of Youth and a Question They Wish to Ask the Artificial Intelligence. The Exploratory Study,Modliński A.,2024,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"The emergence of conversational artificial agents facilitates the process of seeking knowledge. Nevertheless, very little is known about what young people want to learn from artificial intelligence in general. Earlier research on the youth’s internet behaviour showed that young people suffering from anxiety disorders or generally low mental well-being are looking for the solutions to their problems online. It was suspected that young people may try to obtain such answers also from artificial conversational agents. Using Maslow’s concept of needs, a study was conducted on 402 young people aged 9–14, in which they were asked for what question they would like the artificial intelligence responds to. The results show that young people choosing questions related to both psychological and safety needs had lower mental ill-being than those asking for love and belonging as well as esteem. Moreover, the youth trying to find an answer for love and belonging-related issues and those related to esteem had higher mental ill-being than those asking for self-actualization, and personal interests.

Deploying AI Methods for Mental Health in Singapore: From Mental Wellness to Serious Mental Health Conditions,Heaukulani C.,2024,Ceur Workshop Proceedings,"We describe our results from the implementation of machine learning and AI methods in three digital health initiatives serving individuals across the mental health spectrum in Singapore. The first initiative is Project HOPES, which we launched in 2019 for patients with serious mental illnesses. Originating as an observational study on digital phenotypes (collected via smartphones and wrist wearables) of 100 patients with schizophrenia, the tool has now been introduced as a service within a tertiary setting and has expanded to include patients with depression. The strategy dynamically prioritizes patients for early review by care coordinators according to need, which may avoid hospitalizations. Machine learning is used to predict clinical status, i.e., symptoms and functioning, and to predict relapses and other adverse clinical events; the latter can be done at 92% sensitivity and 90% specificity with the available digital biomarkers. The second initiative we describe is mindline.sg (www.mindline.sg), a platform for mental wellness in the general population that we created in 2020. Through a public-facing website, we deliver over 800 resources including wellness education, clinically validated self-assessments and triaging, and interactive resources, including an AI chatbot. Launched at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all its attendant stresses, the platform has been visited by somewhere between 10 to 20% of the national population by the end of 2023. The third initiative we describe is Let’s Talk (https://letstalk.mindline.sg), an online peer-support mental health network, which was co-created with youth advocates. The need for this platform was discovered through extensive studies with youth who expressed a desire for human-based support beyond the proliferation of digital solutions. In its first year, the site has been visited by over 80,000 unique users. Trained moderators review content on the site for safety and accuracy, and qualified therapists provide professional support through the free and anonymous Ask-A-Therapist service.

AI-Based Mental Health Assessment for Adolescents Using Their Daily Digital Activities,Kim D.H.,2024,2024 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics Dsaa 2024,"Adolescents and their parents hesitate to acknowledge mental health issues until symptoms severely worsen, making timely treatment challenging. Moreover, infrequent psychiatric consultations often fail to adjust treatments to the dynamic nature of mental health states. To address these issues, our paper proposes an AI-based mental health assessment framework for adolescent mental health through non-invasively collected data from daily digital activities on their mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones. For this, we collect fifteen different types of passive sensor data across three primary categories of activities: studying, smartphone using, and metaverse gaming. Additionally, each adolescent completes self-survey reports on eight different disorders which are used as labels. Then, feature extraction is conducted based on this dataset, which yields 1,523 features that could function as potential digital biomarkers of mental health conditions in adolescents. Utilizing these features, our algorithm named CAMP: Customizable Automated Machine learning Process incorporates simulated annealing for feature selection. This approach enables the construction of AI models for mental health assessment that are finely tuned to domain specific strategies.

Performance Evaluation of SAE-O-BiLSTM for Predicting the Suicidal Behavior,Vandana V.,2024,2024 4th International Conference on Advancement in Electronics and Communication Engineering Aece 2024,"Adolescents experience a complex transition from childhood to adulthood, focusing on the development of physiological and psychological factors. The various challenges associated with them include identity struggles, academic pressure and social adjustments, emotional adjustments etc. which contribute to serious mental health issues. If not addressed properly may lead to increase in the feelings of hopelessness and despair. Sometimes this kind of situation may lead to serious and complicated issues like suicide. Early and appropriate support can significantly reduce the risk of suicide among teenagers. Digital platforms and AI have the potential to enhance mental health and suicide detection and prevention and treatment outcomes. The study predicts suicide by using SAE-O-BiLSTM (Author's model). The model makes use of the NLP and various deep learning algorithms to predict the suicide behavior in adolescents.

Development and Implementation of a Web Application for Monitoring Social Media Use in Adolescents using Predictive Models Based on Machine Learning,Jose Sebastian L.Q.,2024,Proceedings of the 2024 IEEE 4th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies for Education and Research Icalter 2024,"The rising use of social media among adolescents has led to a concerning increase in mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, highlighting the need for tools that can identify and address these risks early on. This paper presents a web application that employs Random Forest models, combining machine learning with cognitive-behavioral approaches to diagnose social media addiction risks in real-time among adolescents, facilitating personalized interventions for parents and health professionals. Additionally, social media addiction, characterized by Network Obsession (OR), Lack of Personal Control (FCP), and Excessive Use (UE), has shown negative impacts on adolescents' mental health. To address this issue, the dataset, comprising over 10,000 records, was gathered through an ARS questionnaire and real-time monitoring data on social media behavior, including connection hours and types of content consumed. Experiments conducted on a sample of 120 students from Colegio Trini de Carabayllo, out of a population of 450, demonstrated outstanding results: the FCP model achieved 100% accuracy and an F1-score of 100%, effectively detecting lack of personal control; the OR model attained 98.29% accuracy and an F1-score of 99.04%, highly effectively identifying cases of network obsession; and the UE model reached 93.93% accuracy and an F1-score of 96.10%, detecting excessive use patterns.

Key risk factors of generalized anxiety disorder in adolescents: machine learning study,Moon Y.,2024,Frontiers in Public Health,"Adolescents worldwide are increasingly affected by mental health disorders, with anxiety disorders, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), being particularly prevalent. Despite its significant impact, GAD in adolescents often remains underdiagnosed due to vague symptoms and delayed medical attention, highlighting the need for early diagnosis and prevention strategies. This study utilized data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS) from 2020 to 2023 to analyze factors influencing GAD in adolescents. Using machine learning techniques such as Lasso Regression, SelectKBest, and XGBoost, we identified key variables, including health behaviors such as sleep, smoking, and fast-food intake, as significant factors associated with GAD. Predictive models using Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks demonstrated that the XGBoost feature selection method effectively identified key factors and showed strong performance. These findings emphasize the need for educational programs focusing on sleep management, smoking prevention, and balanced nutrition to reduce the risk of GAD in adolescents, providing crucial insights for early diagnosis and intervention efforts.",10.3389/fpubh.2024.1504739,1,Scopus,85215525109,2-s2.0-85215525109,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215525109
Predicting Smartphone Addiction in Teenagers: An Integrative Model Incorporating Machine Learning and Big Five Personality Traits,Osorio J.,2024,Journal of Computer Science,"Smartphone addiction has emerged as a growing concern in society, particularly among teenagers, due to its potential negative impact on physical, emotional social well-being. The excessive use of smartphones has consistently shown associations with negative outcomes, highlighting a strong dependence on these devices, which often leads to detrimental effects on mental health, including heightened levels of anxiety, distress, stress depression. This psychological burden can further result in the neglect of daily activities as individuals become increasingly engrossed in seeking pleasure through their smartphones. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model utilizing machine learning techniques to identify smartphone addiction based on the ""Big Five Personality Traits (BFPT)"". The model was developed by following five out of the six phases of the ""Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)"" methodology, namely ""business understanding,"" ""data understanding,"" ""data preparation,"" ""modeling,"" and ""evaluation."" To construct the database, data was collected from a school using the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS) questionnaires. Subsequently, four algorithms (DT, RF, XGB LG) were employed the correlation between the personality traits and addiction was examined. The analysis revealed a relationship between the traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness with smartphone addiction. The results demonstrated that the RF algorithm achieved an accuracy of 89.7%, a precision of 87.3% the highest AUC value on the ROC curve. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed model in accurately predicting smartphone addiction among adolescents.",10.3844/jcssp.2024.181.190,2,Scopus,85183550330,2-s2.0-85183550330,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183550330

Prediction of Happiness Index for School Children using an Ensemble based Approach,Anand K.,2024,Proceedings 2024 4th International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Social Networking Icpcsn 2024,"Recent studies show a concerning rise in mental health disorders among youth, with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation being prevalent issues affecting student's well-being and academic performance. Student's happiness and general well-being are very important in schools. A child's mental health has a significant impact on all areas of their development, including social relationships, academic achievement, and long-term mental health. This study measures the happiness index in schools by integrating a self-assessment tool and with a particular emphasis on mental health. The model under consideration utilizes a dataset that includes a range of sociodemographic, academic, psychological, and physiological characteristics that were gathered from a diverse population of school-age children. As input variables, characteristics including peer relationships, extracurricular activity, academic success, and family dynamics will be taken into account. Children's self-assessment tools and surveys are used to measure the target variable, which is the happiness index. An ensemble model that incorporates various machine learning models like KNN, Naïve Bayes, and XG boost is utilized to forecast schoolchildren's happiness score.

"Centering equity, diversity, and inclusion in youth digital mental health: findings from a research, policy, and practice knowledge exchange workshop",Adu M.,2024,Frontiers in Digital Health,"Background: Youth mental health service organizations continue to rapidly broaden their use of virtual care and digital mental health interventions as well as leverage artificial intelligence and other technologies to inform care decisions. However, many of these digital services have failed to alleviate persistent mental health disparities among equity-seeking populations and in some instances have exacerbated them. Transdisciplinary and intersectional knowledge exchange is greatly needed to address structural barriers to digital mental health engagement, develop and evaluate interventions with historically underserved communities, and ultimately promote more accessible, useful, and equitable care. Methods: To that end, the Digital, Inclusive, Virtual, and Equitable Research Training in Mental Health Platform (DIVERT), the Maritime Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) SUPPORT (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) Unit and IWK Mental Health Program invited researchers, policymakers, interprofessional mental health practitioners, trainees, computer scientists, health system administrators, community leaders and youth advocates to participate in a knowledge exchange workshop. The workshop aimed to (a) highlight local research and innovation in youth-focused digital mental health services; (b) learn more about current policy and practice issues in inclusive digital mental health for youth in Canada, (c) participate in generating action recommendations to address challenges to inclusive, diverse and equitable digital mental health services, and (d) to synthesize cross-sector feedback to inform future training curriculum, policy, strategic planning and to stimulate new lines of patient-oriented research. Results: Eleven challenge themes emerged related to white-colonial normativity, lack of cultural humility, inaccessibility and affordability of participating in the digital world, lack of youth and community involvement, risks of too much digital time in youth's lives, and lack of scientific evidence derived from equity-deserving communities. Nine action recommendations focused on diversifying research and development funding, policy and standards, youth and community led promotion, long-term trust-building and collaboration, and needing to callout and advocate against unsafe digital services and processes.

Early warning model of adolescent mental health based on big data and machine learning,Zhang Z.,2024,Soft Computing,"Adolescent mental health issues like depression and anxiety are rising among adolescents worldwide, leading to serious long-term consequences if left untreated. However, stigma and lack of resources delay access to timely screening and care. Traditional subjective methods fail to detect early warning signs and risk factors. This paper develops a novel hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model to enable early warning of common mental health risks like depression in teenagers. The model is trained on a large clinical dataset with over 50,000 adolescents encompassing electronic health records and neuroimaging data. This allows discovering subtle predictive patterns within clinical encounters and brain structure or function at the population level. The methodology centers on a tailored CNN and LSTM architecture to comprehensively model the multivariate clinical time series data, combining CNN spatial feature learning with LSTM temporal sequence modeling. The hybrid approach leverages complementary techniques to analyze the neuroimaging and electronic health record data. The model achieves an accuracy of 95%, AUC of 97%, precision of 94%, recall of 91%, and F1 score of 92% on held-out test data, significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art models which had lower accuracy. Detailed predictive feature analysis and clinical validation confirm the model's utility for early mental health risk screening and targeted intervention in teenagers. Overall, the study demonstrates an effective approach to integrating big data, deep learning and rigorous evaluation for developing more accurate, explainable and useful models to support adolescent mental healthcare through data-driven early warning systems.",10.1007/s00500-023-09422-z,15,Scopus,105005123467,2-s2.0-105005123467,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105005123467

Effects of the “AI-TA” Mobile App With Intelligent Design on Psychological and Related Symptoms of Young Survivors of Breast Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial,Jiang L.,2024,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Young women often face substantial psychological challenges in the initial years following cancer diagnosis, leading to a comparatively lower quality of life than older survivors. While mobile apps have emerged as potential interventions, their effectiveness remains inconclusive due to the diversity in intervention types and variation in follow-up periods. Furthermore, there is a particular dearth of evidence regarding the efficacy of these apps' intelligent features in addressing psychological distress with these apps. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile app with intelligent design called “AI-TA” on cancer-related psychological health and ongoing symptoms with a randomized controlled design. Methods: Women aged 18 to 45 years diagnosed with breast cancer were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention was AI-TA, which included 2-way web-based follow-up every 2 weeks. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses employed repeated measurement analysis of variance. The participants' background features, primary outcomes (psychological distress and frequency, self-efficacy, and social support), and secondary outcomes (quality of life) were measured using multiple instruments at 3 time points (baseline, 1-month intervention, and 3-month intervention). Results: A total of 124 participants were randomly allocated to the control group (n=62, 50%) or intervention group (n=62, 50%). In total, 92.7% (115/124) of the participants completed the intervention. Significant improvements in psychological symptoms (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form) were observed in the ITT group from baseline to 1-month intervention relative to the control group (ITT vs control: 1.17 vs 1.23; P < .001), which persisted at 3-month follow-up (ITT vs control: 0.68 vs 0.91; P < .001). Both the ITT and PP groups exhibited greater improvements in self-efficacy (Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Version) than the control group at 1-month (ITT vs PP vs control: 82.83 vs 77.12 vs 65.35; P < .001) and 3-month intervention (ITT vs PP vs control: 92.83 vs 89.30 vs 85.65; P < .001). However, the change in social support (Social Support Rating Scale) did not increase significantly until 3-month intervention (ITT vs control: 50.09 vs 45.10; P=.002) (PP vs control: 49.78 vs 45.10; P < .001). All groups also experienced beneficial effects on quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), which persisted at 3-month follow-up (P < .001). Conclusions: The intelligent mobile app AI-TA incorporating intelligent design shows promise for reducing psychological and cancer-related symptoms among young survivors of breast cancer.",10.2196/50783,8,Scopus,85194997276,2-s2.0-85194997276,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194997276
Leveraging Online Social Content for Early Detection of Suicidal Ideation: A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Approach,Toliya N.P.,2024,International Conference on Emerging Technologies in Computer Science for Interdisciplinary Applications Icetcs 2024,"The contemporary society is grappling with the alarming rise in suicide rates, exacerbated by factors such as prolonged exposure to negative emotions and challenging life events. Detecting early signs of suicidal ideation holds significant promise in addressing this crisis. In the digital age, online communication platforms have become outlets for individuals to express distress, presenting an opportunity for timely intervention. This study aims to explore online social content for the early identification of suicidal ideation, with a focus on user-generated text that contains valuable insights into people's mental states. The research begins with a thorough content analysis to extract knowledge from suicide-related text, establishing a benchmark for binary classification of suicidal ideation using various classifiers, including feature-based and deep neural networks. The urgency of early detection for prevention underscores the importance of this research. By integrating content analysis, feature engineering, and advanced deep learning methodologies, such as deep neural networks and attentive relation networks, this study aims to contribute to suicide prevention efforts. This paper advocates for the application of multi-modal deep learning techniques to identify early signs of suicidal ideation from online social content. The integration of machine learning and mental health intervention is crucial in addressing the escalating concern of suicide rates, especially among vulnerable populations like youths.

Gamified Digital Mental Health Interventions for Young People: Scoping Review of Ethical Aspects During Development and Implementation,Spahl W.,2024,Jmir Serious Games,"Background: Young people are particularly at risk of developing mental health problems, a challenge exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Digital tools such as apps and chatbots show promise in providing accessible, cost-effective, and less stigmatized ways of strengthening their mental health.However, while these interventions offer benefits, they extend mental health measures beyond traditional therapeutic settings and relationships, which raises ethical concerns due to the absence of established guidelines and regulations.This is particularly notable for technologies incorporating serious gaming elements.In addition, adolescents are in a sensitive and at times vulnerable phase, which shows great potential for the effective use of preventive and sensitizing mental health measures.Considering the lack of an integration into existing mental health structures among many young users, ethical considerations become crucial.Objective: This scoping review aims to build a knowledge base on the ethical aspects of developing and implementing gamified digital mental health interventions for young people.Methods: We conducted a search on research articles and conference papers from 2015 to 2023 in English, German, and Spanish.We identified 1815 studies using a unique combination of keywords in the databases Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO.After removing duplicates (741/1816, 40.8%), we included a total of 38 publications in this review following a double screening process.Results: This review found that ethically relevant aspects were discussed with regard to (1) research ethics, (2) ethical principles (including privacy, accessibility, empowerment and autonomy, cultural and social sensitivity, and co-design), (3) vulnerable groups, and (4) social implications (including implementation using facilitators in specific social contexts, relationship with other therapeutic options, economic aspects, and social embeddedness of technologies).Conclusions: This scoping review identified a prevailing limited interpretation of “ethics” as research ethics across the included publications.It also shows a lack of discussion on the social embeddedness of technologies and that co-design is frequently viewed in instrumental terms and vulnerability is mostly addressed pragmatically.Through providing concrete examples of how mental health researchers and game designers thus far have addressed and mitigated ethical challenges in specific interventions, this review illustrates how ethical issues do or do not prompt diverse reflections, mitigation strategies, and actions.It advocates for ethics to be integrated as an ongoing practice throughout all stages of developing and implementing serious game elements in mental health interventions for young people.",10.2196/64488,3,Scopus,85211618908,2-s2.0-85211618908,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211618908
A Humane Social Learning-Informed Metaverse: Cultivating Positive Technology Experiences in Digital Learning Environments,Villamil A.,2024,Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking,"Online environments, such as metaverses, provide distinct social environments for people to engage in complex, cognitive, and multidirectional learning and meaning-making experiences. These engaging and influential environments highlight important factors associated with the Social Learning Theory (a process through which external settings influence behavior in specific environments). According to this theory, environments provide a space for youth to engage in reciprocal interactions of interpersonal, behavioral, and environmental cues. Online environments designed by social media companies have been scrutinized, given their dependence on algorithms (artificial intelligence systems). Research has revealed the effects of systems that use machine learning to subversively maintain engagement on their platforms for as long as possible. Given the constant changes in socializing environments, younger generational cohorts need to be adequately prepared for systems that determine what type of content they are exposed to, and shape the timing, frequency, and agentic influencers they engage with. Therefore, this article proposes a necessity to expand our understanding about social learning and current technology design principles. This article demonstrates the need for a paradigm shift toward exploring an innovative construct referred to as the digital learning environment. We examine existing issues in the design of digital spaces, provide a positive developmental psychology framework that informs further research, and propose solutions for researchers, educators, policymakers, and caregivers as they navigate healthy technology use and predominant mental health issues in the 21st century.",10.1089/cyber.2023.0001,8,Scopus,85182088324,2-s2.0-85182088324,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182088324
Applications of Natural Language Processing to Predict Suicidal Tendencies from Social Media Textual Input,Cruz R.M.R.,2024,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"Many teenagers have increasingly utilized social media to convey their suicidal tendencies, or to seek information on how to commit suicide to the extent of participating in suicide pacts. The objective of the study is to apply natural language processing in a social media messaging platform to recognize suicidal tendencies in user messages. The preprocessed textual message data was then trained to detect suicide using three commonly used machine learning models namely Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting. Logistic regression obtained the highest diagnostic capability and hence was integrated in a Discord bot that detects suicidal intent on the posted message. The Discord bot is a server-owner-only accessible channel that can automatically receive notifications of probable suicidal intentions and thus was designed to serve as the medium for possible intervention. The bot scans the messages sent to a specific server-owner-only channel, determines whether the message exhibits suicidal disposition or objective, and then outputs the username of the message sender, the actual message, and the likelihood of suicidal tendency. Natural language processing offered new prospects to significantly improve suicide risk assessment contributing heavily to prevention measures and highlighting its clinical utility in the practice of mental health professionals.",10.1007/978-981-97-7571-2_30,0,Scopus,85214400447,2-s2.0-85214400447,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214400447
"Digital Phenotyping for Stress, Anxiety, and Mild Depression: Systematic Literature Review",Choi A.,2024,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Unaddressed early-stage mental health issues, including stress, anxiety, and mild depression, can become a burden for individuals in the long term. Digital phenotyping involves capturing continuous behavioral data via digital smartphone devices to monitor human behavior and can potentially identify milder symptoms before they become serious. Objective: This systematic literature review aimed to answer the following questions: (1) what is the evidence of the effectiveness of digital phenotyping using smartphones in identifying behavioral patterns related to stress, anxiety, and mild depression? and (2) in particular, which smartphone sensors are found to be effective, and what are the associated challenges? Methods: We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) process to identify 36 papers (reporting on 40 studies) to assess the key smartphone sensors related to stress, anxiety, and mild depression. We excluded studies conducted with nonadult participants (eg, teenagers and children) and clinical populations, as well as personality measurement and phobia studies. As we focused on the effectiveness of digital phenotyping using smartphones, results related to wearable devices were excluded. Results: We categorized the studies into 3 major groups based on the recruited participants: studies with students enrolled in universities, studies with adults who were unaffiliated to any particular organization, and studies with employees employed in an organization. The study length varied from 10 days to 3 years. A range of passive sensors were used in the studies, including GPS, Bluetooth, accelerometer, microphone, illuminance, gyroscope, and Wi-Fi. These were used to assess locations visited; mobility; speech patterns; phone use, such as screen checking; time spent in bed; physical activity; sleep; and aspects of social interactions, such as the number of interactions and response time. Of the 40 included studies, 31 (78%) used machine learning models for prediction; most others (n=8, 20%) used descriptive statistics. Students and adults who experienced stress, anxiety, or depression visited fewer locations, were more sedentary, had irregular sleep, and accrued increased phone use. In contrast to students and adults, less mobility was seen as positive for employees because less mobility in workplaces was associated with higher performance. Overall, travel, physical activity, sleep, social interaction, and phone use were related to stress, anxiety, and mild depression. Conclusions: This study focused on understanding whether smartphone sensors can be effectively used to detect behavioral patterns associated with stress, anxiety, and mild depression in nonclinical participants. The reviewed studies provided evidence that smartphone sensors are effective in identifying behavioral patterns associated with stress, anxiety, and mild depression.",10.2196/40689,18,Scopus,85194022260,2-s2.0-85194022260,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194022260
Evaluating an App-Based Intervention for Preventing Firearm Violence and Substance Use in Young Black Boys and Men: Usability Evaluation Study,Emezue C.,2024,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Young Black male individuals are 24 times more likely to be impacted by firearm injuries and homicides but encounter significant barriers to care and service disengagement, even in program-rich cities across the United States, leaving them worryingly underserved. Existing community-based interventions focus on secondary and tertiary prevention after firearm violence has occurred and are typically deployed in emergency settings. To address these service and uptake issues, we developed BrotherlyACT—a nurse-led, culturally tailored, multicomponent app—to reduce the risk and effects of firearm injuries and homicides and to improve access to precrisis and mental health resources for young Black male individuals (aged 15-24 years) in low-resource and high-violence settings. Grounded in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, the app provides life skills coaching, safety planning, artificial intelligence–powered talk therapy, and zip code–based service connections directly to young Black male individuals at risk for violence and substance use. Objective: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the usability, engagement, and satisfaction of BrotherlyACT among target young Black male users and mobile health (mHealth) experts, using a combination of formative usability testing (UT) and heuristic evaluation (HE). Methods: Using a convergent mixed methods approach, we evaluated the BrotherlyACT app using HE by 8 mHealth specialists and conducted UT with 23 participants, comprising 15 young Black male users (aged 15-24 years), alongside 4 adult internal team testers and 4 high school students who were part of our youth advisory board. UT included the System Usability Scale and thematic analysis of think-aloud interviews and cognitive walkthroughs. HE involved mHealth experts applying the Nielsen severity rating scale (score 0-3, with 3 indicating a major issue). All testing was conducted via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) and Zoom or in person. Results: Qualitative usability issues were categorized into 8 thematic groups, revealing only minor usability concerns. The app achieved an average System Usability Scale score of 79, equivalent to an A-minus grade and placing it in the 85th percentile, indicating near-excellent usability. Similarly, the HE by testers identified minor and cosmetic usability issues, with a median severity score of 1 across various heuristics (on a scale of 0-3), indicating minimal impact on user experience. Overall, minor adjustments were recommended to enhance navigation, customization, and guidance for app users, while the app’s visual and functional design was generally well received. Conclusions: BrotherlyACT was considered highly usable and acceptable. Testers in the UT stage gave the app a positive overall rating and emphasized that several key improvements were made. Findings from our UT prompted revisions to the app prototype. Moving forward, a pilot study with a pretest-posttest design will evaluate the app’s efficacy in community health and emergency care settings.",10.2196/60918,2,Scopus,85210900715,2-s2.0-85210900715,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210900715
Machine Learning-Based Early Detection and Intervention for Mental Health Issues in Children,Kataru S.,2024,Proceedings 2024 IEEE 48th Annual Computers Software and Applications Conference Compsac 2024,"Mental health disorders in children and adolescents are increasingly problematic, necessitating the development of effective early detection tools due to their impact on long-term individual and societal health. Previous research has applied machine learning (ML) techniques to detect stress through physiological data and social media sentiment analysis, yet its use in direct assessment of children's mental health is scant. This study introduces a novel method by analyzing data from 2,600 elementary students gathered by the Healthier Kids Foundation regarding their mental health. We developed and evaluated three ML models, including a multi-tier approach, to identify students needing further mental health interventions, with assessments verified by human clinicians. These models achieved a maximum accuracy of 94.5% in four mental health categories. The results underscore the potential of ML in enhancing diagnostic and intervention strategies in children's mental health services, offering significant benefits by potentially reducing the health burden faced by children and adolescents with untreated mental health conditions. This research not only advances ML applications in child mental health assessment but also provides actionable insights for healthcare providers to integrate these technologies into practice.",10.1109/COMPSAC61105.2024.00320,3,Scopus,85204043685,2-s2.0-85204043685,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204043685
Ability of clinical data to predict readmission in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services,Koochakpour K.,2024,Peerj Computer Science,"This study addresses the challenge of predicting readmissions in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) by analyzing the predictability of readmissions over short, medium, and long term periods. Using health records spanning 35 years, which included 22, 643 patients and 30, 938 episodes of care, we focused on the episode of care as a central unit, defined as a referral-discharge cycle that incorporates assessments and interventions. Data pre-processing involved handling missing values, normalizing, and transforming data, while resolving issues related to overlapping episodes and correcting registration errors where possible. Readmission prediction was inferred from electronic health records (EHR), as this variable was not directly recorded. A binary classifier distinguished between readmitted and non-readmitted patients, followed by a multi-class classifier to categorize readmissions based on timeframes: short (within 6 months), medium (6 months - 2 years), and long (more than 2 years). Several predictive models were evaluated based on metrics like AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall, and the K-prototype algorithm was employed to explore similarities between episodes through clustering. The optimal binary classifier (Oversampled Gradient Boosting) achieved an AUC of 0.7005, while the multi-class classifier (Oversampled Random Forest) reached an AUC of 0.6368. The K-prototype resulted in three clusters as optimal (SI: 0.256, CI: 4473.64). Despite identifying relationships between care intensity, case complexity, and readmission risk, generalizing these findings proved difficult, partly because clinicians often avoid discharging patients likely to be readmitted. Overall, while this dataset offers insights into patient care and service patterns, predicting readmissions remains challenging, suggesting a need for improved analytical models that consider patient development, disease progression, and intervention effects.",10.7717/peerj-cs.2367,1,Scopus,85207924074,2-s2.0-85207924074,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207924074
Factors and pathways of non-suicidal self-injury in children: insights from computational causal analysis,Guo X.,2024,Frontiers in Public Health,"Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has become a significant public health issue, especially prevalent among adolescents. The complexity and multifactorial nature of NSSI necessitate a comprehensive understanding of its underlying causal factors. This research leverages the causal discovery methodology to explore these causal associations in children. Methods: An observational dataset was scrutinized using the causal discovery method, particularly employing the constraint-based approach. By integrating machine learning and causal inference techniques, the study aimed to determine direct causal relationships associated with NSSI. The robustness of the causal relationships was evaluated using three methods to construct and validate it: the PC (Peter and Clark) method, Fast Causal Inference (FCI) method, and the GAE (Graphical Autoencoder) method. Results: Analysis identified nine nodes with direct causal relationships to NSSI, including life satisfaction, depression, family dysfunction, sugary beverage consumption, PYD (positive youth development), internet addiction, COVID-19 related PTSD, academic anxiety, and sleep duration. Four principal causal pathways were identified, highlighting the roles of lockdown-induced lifestyle changes, screen time, positive adolescent development, and family dynamics in influencing NSSI risk. Conclusions: An in-depth analysis of the factors leading to Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), highlighting the intricate connections among individual, family, and pandemic-related influences. The results, derived from computational causal analysis, underscore the critical need for targeted interventions that tackle these diverse causative factors.",10.3389/fpubh.2024.1305746,7,Scopus,85188523868,2-s2.0-85188523868,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188523868
Student Stress Detection in Online Learning During Outbreak,Ray A.,2024,Computational Methods in Psychiatry,"Stress is a state of mental strain for a specific person experiencing issues with their social and environmental well-being, which can result in a variety of illnesses. Young age is a crucial stage since it is a time when youth experience many changes in their lives. They are anticipated to be the social elite. Thus, in order to have a healthy life once they are integrated into society, individuals should improve their stress management skills. The newly infectious disease COVID-19 became the pandemic and due to this government around the world has closed all the educational institutions to stop the spread of COVID-19. The sudden shift from physical class room to virtual space has created the direct impact on students, educators, and institutions. This study explored and analysed the academic stress level experienced by students during online education which arose due to COVID-19 pandemic with regard to mental health of students during social isolation. Our study intends to define and characterise how the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of new technology affect an individual’s stress levels. This research employed deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and machine learning algorithms support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), Decision Tree (DT) to quickly and accurately identify stress in a large population. To achieve the best accuracy rate, a comparative study between the machine and deep learning algorithms has been performed. The results exhibited that CNN the deep learning algorithm outperformed than non-deep learning methods and MLP. As a result, CNN, a deep learning technique, might serve as a more accurate predictor for the identification of stress level. In order to prevent stress from endangering those millions of people’s lives, this paper aims to raise their awareness of early stress diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the report clarifies how policies on stress and preventative measures for stress will be rebuilt by policymakers in the school sector and general industry sector.",10.1007/978-981-99-6637-0_13,2,Scopus,85200683911,2-s2.0-85200683911,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200683911
Emerging Trends of Self-Harm Using Sodium Nitrite in an Online Suicide Community: Observational Study Using Natural Language Processing Analysis,Das S.,2024,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: There is growing concern around the use of sodium nitrite (SN) as an emerging means of suicide, particularly among younger people. Given the limited information on the topic from traditional public health surveillance sources, we studied posts made to an online suicide discussion forum, “Sanctioned Suicide,” which is a primary source of information on the use and procurement of SN. Objective: This study aims to determine the trends in SN purchase and use, as obtained via data mining from subscriber posts on the forum. We also aim to determine the substances and topics commonly co-occurring with SN, as well as the geographical distribution of users and sources of SN. Methods: We collected all publicly available from the site’s inception in March 2018 to October 2022. Using data-driven methods, including natural language processing and machine learning, we analyzed the trends in SN mentions over time, including the locations of SN consumers and the sources from which SN is procured. We developed a transformer-based source and location classifier to determine the geographical distribution of the sources of SN. Results: Posts pertaining to SN show a rise in popularity, and there were statistically significant correlations between real-life use of SN and suicidal intent when compared to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (ρ=0.727; P<.001) and the National Poison Data System (ρ=0.866; P=.001). We observed frequent co-mentions of antiemetics, benzodiazepines, and acid regulators with SN. Our proposed machine learning–based source and location classifier can detect potential sources of SN with an accuracy of 72.92% and showed consumption in the United States and elsewhere. Conclusions: Vital information about SN and other emerging mechanisms of suicide can be obtained from online forums.",10.2196/53730,5,Scopus,85194145461,2-s2.0-85194145461,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194145461
Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Depression in Adolescents: Protocol for a Smartphone-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment and Passive Sensing Study,Ng M.Y.,2024,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Adolescence is marked by an increasing risk of depression and is an optimal window for prevention and early intervention. Personalizing interventions may be one way to maximize therapeutic benefit, especially given the marked heterogeneity in depressive presentations. However, empirical evidence that can guide personalized intervention for youth is lacking. Identifying person-specific symptom drivers during adolescence could improve outcomes by accounting for both developmental and individual differences. Objective: This study leverages adolescents’ everyday smartphone use to investigate person-specific drivers of depression and validate smartphone-based mobile sensing data against established ambulatory methods. We describe the methods of this study and provide an update on its status. After data collection is completed, we will address three specific aims: (1) identify idiographic drivers of dynamic variability in depressive symptoms, (2) test the validity of mobile sensing against ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and actigraphy for identifying these drivers, and (3) explore adolescent baseline characteristics as predictors of these drivers. Methods: A total of 50 adolescents with elevated symptoms of depression will participate in 28 days of (1) smartphone-based EMA assessing depressive symptoms, processes, affect, and sleep; (2) mobile sensing of mobility, physical activity, sleep, natural language use in typed interpersonal communication, screen-on time, and call frequency and duration using the Effortless Assessment of Risk States smartphone app; and (3) wrist actigraphy of physical activity and sleep. Adolescents and caregivers will complete developmental and clinical measures at baseline, as well as user feedback interviews at follow-up. Idiographic, within-subject networks of EMA symptoms will be modeled to identify each adolescent’s person-specific drivers of depression. Correlations among EMA, mobile sensor, and actigraph measures of sleep, physical, and social activity will be used to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying person-specific drivers. Data-driven analyses of mobile sensor variables predicting core depressive symptoms (self-reported mood and anhedonia) will also be used to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying drivers. Finally, between-subject baseline characteristics will be explored as predictors of person-specific drivers. Results: As of October 2023, 84 families were screened as eligible, of whom 70% (n=59) provided informed consent and 46% (n=39) met all inclusion criteria after completing baseline assessment. Of the 39 included families, 85% (n=33) completed the 28-day smartphone and actigraph data collection period and follow-up study visit. Conclusions: This study leverages depressed adolescents’ everyday smartphone use to identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression and to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying these drivers. The findings are expected to offer novel insights into the structure and dynamics of depressive symptomatology during a sensitive period of development and to inform future development of a scalable, low-burden smartphone-based tool that can guide personalized treatment decisions for depressed adolescents.",10.2196/43931,1,Scopus,85199703203,2-s2.0-85199703203,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199703203

The latest developments with internet-based psychological treatments for depression,Andersson G.,2024,Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics,"Introduction: Internet-based psychological treatments for depression have been around for more than 20 years. There has been a continuous line of research with new research questions being asked and studies conducted. Areas covered: In this paper, the author reviews studies with a focus on papers published from 2020 and onwards based on a Medline and Scopus search. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) programs have been developed and tested for adolescents, older adults, immigrant groups and to handle a societal crisis (e.g. COVID-19). ICBT works in regular clinical settings and long-term effects can be obtained. Studies on different treatment orientations and approaches such as acceptance commitment therapy, unified protocol, and tailored treatments have been conducted. Effects on quality-of-life measures, knowledge acquisition and ecological momentary assessment as a research tool have been reported. Factorial design trials and individual patient data meta-analysis are increasingly used in association with internet intervention research. Finally, prediction studies and recent advances in artificial intelligence are mentioned. Expert opinion: Internet-delivered treatments are effective, in particular if therapist guidance is provided.

Investigating the Potential of a Conversational Agent (Phyllis) to Support Adolescent Health and Overcome Barriers to Physical Activity: Co-Design Study,Moore R.,2024,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are a promising solution to support people in improving physical activity (PA) behaviors. However, there is a lack of CAs targeted at adolescents that aim to provide support to overcome barriers to PA. This study reports the results of the co-design, development, and evaluation of a prototype CA called “Phyllis” to support adolescents in overcoming barriers to PA with the aim of improving PA behaviors. The study presents one of the first theory-driven CAs that use existing research, a theoretical framework, and a behavior change model. Objective: The aim of the study is to use a mixed methods approach to investigate the potential of a CA to support adolescents in overcoming barriers to PA and enhance their confidence and motivation to engage in PA. Methods: The methodology involved co-designing with 8 adolescents to create a relational and persuasive CA with a suitable persona and dialogue. The CA was evaluated to determine its acceptability, usability, and effectiveness, with 46 adolescents participating in the study via a web-based survey. Results: The co-design participants were students aged 11 to 13 years, with a sex distribution of 56% (5/9) female and 44% (4/9) male, representing diverse ethnic backgrounds. Participants reported 37 specific barriers to PA, and the most common barriers included a “lack of confidence,” “fear of failure,” and a “lack of motivation.” The CA’s persona, named “Phyllis,” was co-designed with input from the students, reflecting their preferences for a friendly, understanding, and intelligent personality. Users engaged in 61 conversations with Phyllis and reported a positive user experience, and 73% of them expressed a definite intention to use the fully functional CA in the future, with a net promoter score indicating a high likelihood of recommendation. Phyllis also performed well, being able to recognize a range of different barriers to PA. The CA’s persuasive capacity was evaluated in modules focusing on confidence and motivation, with a significant increase in students’ agreement in feeling confident and motivated to engage in PA after interacting with Phyllis. Adolescents also expect to have a personalized experience and be able to personalize all aspects of the CA. Conclusions: The results showed high acceptability and a positive user experience, indicating the CA’s potential. Promising outcomes were observed, with increasing confidence and motivation for PA. Further research and development are needed to create further interventions to address other barriers to PA and assess long-term behavior change. Addressing concerns regarding bias and privacy is crucial for achieving acceptability in the future. The CA’s potential extends to health care systems and multimodal support, providing valuable insights for designing digital health interventions including tackling global inactivity issues among adolescents.",10.2196/51571,2,Scopus,85184870579,2-s2.0-85184870579,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184870579
Cyberbullying Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study,Alkasassbeh M.,2024,2nd International Conference on Cyber Resilience Iccr 2024,"Cyberbullying has become a serious issue with the rise in social media usage, especially among adolescents. Victims of cyberbullying often suffer from psychological distress, anxiety, depression and even suicidal tendencies. With the rapid growth of user-generated content online, manual detection of cyberbullying is extremely difficult. Hence, automated cyber-bullying detection systems are needed. In recent years, deep learning models have emerged as a promising technique for cyberbullying detection. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the use of deep learning for cyberbullying detection. The key contributions are: (1) a taxonomy of cyberbullying detection techniques, (2) a review of datasets used for model training and evaluation, (3) a comparative analysis of various deep learning models including CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU and Transformer- based models, (4) a discussion of key challenges and limitations, and (5) suggestions for future research directions. The paper provides a critical perspective on model performance across multiple datasets.

Teenagers Falling Down a Rabbit Hole: How to Help Them Recover from Their Online Activities,Tyminski R.,2024,Jung Journal Culture and Psyche,"This article looks at the contemporary phenomenon of adolescents and children spending increasing amounts of their time on screens. Some of this was accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland is a way to conceptualize what happens when someone goes down a rabbit hole, becoming lost online. Usually, it is more of a nightmare than just a bad dream. The psychological effects can include a pull toward magical thinking and transactional relating. Both can flatten cognitive and emotional depth. Jung’s use of Lévy-Bruhl’s term participation mystique is reviewed as a way to understand a trend toward individual and collective fantasies of being merged with the online world through our screens. Artificial intelligence (AI) introduces a completely newer aspect of this trend. The author reviews his previous ideas about seeking relief from emotional distress by using screens as alternate psychic containers. All of these uses of screens are problematic because they can lead to overexcitement, inner depletion, devaluation of self-capacities, and reliance on nonhuman contacts. Suggestions for addressing the mental health issues that arise from overdependence on screens are proposed.",10.1080/19342039.2024.2405399,0,Scopus,85212179152,2-s2.0-85212179152,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212179152
Analysis of Adolescent Mental Health Based on Machine Learning Algorithm,Wang P.,2024,2024 3rd International Conference for Advancement in Technology Iconat 2024,"With the improvement of people's living standards, material needs have been satisfied, so attention has begun to be paid to mental health. Among them, adolescents due to adolescence, mental health has attracted more attention, and mental health has a heavy role in adolescent mental health, can be a good understanding of whether adolescents' psychological health. Traditional analysis methods do not provide a clear picture of whether adolescents' mental health is in trouble. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning algorithm for mental health analysis. First, computer technology is used to analyze the health situation of adolescents' psychology, and the indicators are divided according to the requirements of mental health to reduce the interference factors in mental health. Then, computer technology analyzes the results of adolescent mental health, forms a mental health program, and comprehensively analyzes the mental health results.

An Empathetic Social Robot with Modular Anxiety Interventions for Autistic Adolescents,Xie B.,2024,IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication Ro Man,"Autistic individuals, or individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), often experience challenges in social relations and may experience increased stress or anxiety. Recent studies highlight the potential of socially assistive robots (SARs) as tools for robot-assisted interventions. However, current human-robot interaction (HRI) designs lack consideration for the diverse anxiety issues in individuals with ASD and the need for personalized, empathetic assistance. The question that persists is whether the most recent individualized and modular intervention program for autism can also be effectively implemented through the use of SARs. This study presents a novel HRI framework that incorporates psychological factors into a modular intervention aimed at reducing user's anxiety levels. The developed system integrates techniques such as human pose estimation and motion imitation while also leveraging conversational agents. During the user study, users engaged in interactions with a humanoid robot equipped with multiple intervention modules, and their anxiety and perceptions of the robot's empathy were assessed through questionnaires in a within-participants study design. Results show the implemented system effectively mitigated users' anxiety by assessing the differences between pre-session and post-session scores. Additionally, our findings suggest that the observed change in empathetic scores may be a contributing factor to the reduction in anxiety levels.

Multilingual Detection of Cyberbullying on Social Networks Using a Fine-Tuned GPT-3.5 Model,Nina-Gutiérrez E.A.,2024,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Cyberbullying on social networks has emerged as a global problem with serious consequences on the mental health of victims, mainly children, and adolescents. Although there are AI-based solutions to address this issue, they face limitations such as a lack of multilingual datasets, detecting sarcasm, and detecting idioms. Research presents an innovative approach to effective cyberbullying detection using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model. Our main contribution is the creation of an extensive multi-label dataset of approximately 60,000 data in English, and Spanish, spanning diverse dialects. This data set was obtained by combining and processing multiple datasets from reliable sources. In addition, we developed a fine-tuned model based on GPT-3.5, capable of identifying hate speech, and offensive language in textual content on social networks. We conducted a thorough evaluation comparing our model to specialized solutions such as Perspective API, Moderation, Content Safety, Toxic Bert, and Gemini.

The Psychological Impacts of Algorithmic and AI-Driven Social Media on Teenagers: A Call to Action,Arora S.,2024,2024 IEEE Digital Platforms and Societal Harms Dpsh 2024,"This study investigates the meta-issues surrounding social media, which, while theoretically designed to enhance social interactions and improve our social lives by facilitating the sharing of personal experiences and life events, often results in adverse psychological impacts. Our investigation reveals a paradoxical outcome: rather than fostering closer relationships and improving social lives, the algorithms and structures that underlie social media platforms inadvertently contribute to a profound psychological impact on individuals, influencing them in unforeseen ways. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced among teenagers, who are disproportionately affected by curated online personas, peer pressure to present a perfect digital image, and the constant bombardment of notifications and updates that characterize their social media experience. As such, we issue a call to action for policymakers, platform developers, and educators to prioritize the well-being of teenagers in the digital age and work towards creating secure and safe social media platforms that protect the young from harm, online harassment, and exploitation.",10.1109/DPSH60098.2024.10774922,5,Scopus,85215100184,2-s2.0-85215100184,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215100184
"Four Pillars of Help-Seeking Attitudes: Emotional, Societal, Cognitive, and Relational Insights From New Zealand Youth",Sotardi V.A.,2024,Journal of Adolescent Research,"The primary objective of this research is to explore the discourse of young people in New Zealand regarding their attitudes toward seeking help, with a particular focus on the self-stigma that seeking help is viewed as a “weakness.” The study comprises a diverse sample of 668 young people (16–21 years) in New Zealand. Individuals were invited through social media to complete an online questionnaire that focuses on stress, coping, and mental health. This study adopted Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as its qualitative research methodology. A rigorous, seven-step data analysis process was used to integrate reflexive thematic analysis with artificial intelligence. Four themes were identified: (1) “Vulnerability and Emotional Hurdles when Considering Help”; (2) “Societal Narratives and Internalized Barriers when Considering Help-Seeking”; (3) “Wisdom, Maturity, and Thought when Considering Help”; and, (4) “Humanity, Relationships, and Comparisons in Considering Help.” Sub-analyses based on participant demographics reveal important trends in the narratives influenced by gender, age, and ethnicity. The findings underscore the challenges youth face when contemplating seeking help, and provide a range of suggestions for theory and interventions.",10.1177/07435584241291165,3,Scopus,85207408694,2-s2.0-85207408694,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207408694
"Development and Pilot-Testing of an Optimized Conversational Agent or “Chatbot” for Peruvian Adolescents Living With HIV to Facilitate Mental Health Screening, Education, Self-Help, and Linkage to Care: Protocol for a Mixed Methods, Community-Engaged Study",Galea J.T.,2024,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Adolescents living with HIV are disproportionally affected by depression, which worsens antiretroviral therapy adherence, increases viral load, and doubles the risk of mortality. Because most adolescents living with HIV live in low- and middle-income countries, few receive depression treatment due to a lack of mental health services and specialists in low-resource settings. Chatbot technology, used increasingly in health service delivery, is a promising approach for delivering low-intensity depression care to adolescents living with HIV in resource-constrained settings. Objective: The goal of this study is to develop and pilot-test for the feasibility and acceptability of a prototype, optimized conversational agent (chatbot) to provide mental health education, self-help skills, and care linkage for adolescents living with HIV. Methods: Chatbot development comprises 3 phases conducted over 2 years. In the first phase (year 1), formative research will be conducted to understand the views, opinions, and preferences of up to 48 youths aged 10-19 years (6 focus groups of up to 8 adolescents living with HIV per group), their caregivers (5 in-depth interviews), and HIV program personnel (5 in-depth interviews) regarding depression among adolescents living with HIV. We will also investigate the perceived acceptability of a mental health chatbot, including barriers and facilitators to accessing and using a chatbot for depression care by adolescents living with HIV. In the second phase (year 1), we will iteratively program a chatbot using the SmartBot360 software with successive versions (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), meeting regularly with a Youth Advisory Board comprised of adolescents living with HIV who will guide and inform the chatbot development and content to arrive at a prototype version (version 1.0) for pilot-testing. In the third phase (year 2), we will pilot-test the prototype chatbot among 50 adolescents living with HIV naïve to its development. Participants will interact with the chatbot for up to 2 weeks, and data will be collected on the acceptability of the chatbot-delivered depression education and self-help strategies, depression knowledge changes, and intention to seek care linkage. Results: The study was awarded in April 2022, received institutional review board approval in November 2022, received funding in December 2022, and commenced recruitment in March 2023. By the completion of study phases 1 and 2, we expect our chatbot to incorporate key needs and preferences gathered from focus groups and interviews to develop the chatbot. By the completion of study phase 3, we will have assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the prototype chatbot. Study phase 3 began in April 2024. Final results are expected by January 2025 and published thereafter. Conclusions: The study will produce a prototype mental health chatbot developed with and for adolescents living with HIV that will be ready for efficacy testing in a subsequent, larger study.",10.2196/55559,3,Scopus,85193780238,2-s2.0-85193780238,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193780238
Application of machine learning in predicting adolescent Internet behavioral addiction,Gan Y.,2024,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Objective: To explore the risk factors affecting adolescents’ Internet addiction behavior and build a prediction model for adolescents’ Internet addiction behavior based on machine learning algorithms. Methods: A total of 4461 high school students in Chongqing were selected using stratified cluster sampling, and questionnaires were administered. Based on the presence of Internet addiction behavior, students were categorized into an Internet addiction group (n=1210) and a non-Internet addiction group (n=3115). Gender, age, residence type, and other data were compared between the groups, and independent risk factors for adolescent Internet addiction were analyzed using a logistic regression model. Six methods—multi-level perceptron, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting—were used to construct the model. The model’s indicators under each algorithm were compared, evaluated with a confusion matrix, and the optimal model was selected. Result: The proportion of male adolescents, urban household registration, and scores on the family function, planning, action, and cognitive subscales, along with psychoticism, introversion-extroversion, neuroticism, somatization, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoia, and psychosis, were significantly higher in the Internet addiction group than in the non-Internet addiction group (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in age or only-child status (P > 0.05). Statistically significant variables were analyzed using a logistic regression model, revealing that gender, household registration type, and scores on planning, action, introversion-extroversion, psychoticism, neuroticism, cognitive, obsessive-compulsive, depression, and hostility scales are independent risk factors for adolescent Internet addiction. The area under the curve (AUC) for multi-level perceptron, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting models were 0.843, 0.817, 0.778, 0.846, 0.847, and 0.836, respectively, with extreme gradient boosting showing the best predictive performance among these models. Conclusion: The detection rate of Internet addiction is higher in males than in females, and adolescents with impulsive, extroverted, psychotic, neurotic, obsessive, depressive, and hostile traits are more prone to developing Internet addiction. While the overall performance of the machine learning models for predicting adolescent Internet addiction is moderate, the extreme gradient boosting method outperforms others, effectively identifying risk factors and enabling targeted interventions.",10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1521051,2,Scopus,105002464545,2-s2.0-105002464545,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002464545
Early adolescent depression detection system based on the transformer model,Yu H.,2024,Proceedings of SPIE the International Society for Optical Engineering,"Depression is one of the more prevalent mental health disorders, characterized primarily by low mood. Recently, there has been a striking shift, and increasingly younger demographics have started showing symptoms of the same, particularly in adolescents. This paper proposes a new method for the automatic detection of incipient adolescent depression by use of deep multimodal learning techniques. This aims at improving preparedness to better face the rising problem of adolescent depression. In the proposed approach, unimodal features are extracted from electroencephalography(EEG), electrocardiogram(ECG), and speech signals using the Transformer model and subsequently fused into a comprehensive multimodal feature set for binary classification. The model does not only increase its generalizability by fusing different physiological signals but also increases the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic results by fusing multimodal features.",10.1117/12.3048175,1,Scopus,85204775775,2-s2.0-85204775775,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204775775
"Framework for Ranking Machine Learning Predictions of Limited, Multimodal, and Longitudinal Behavioral Passive Sensing Data: Combining User-Agnostic and Personalized Modeling",Mullick T.,2024,Jmir AI,"Background: Passive mobile sensing provides opportunities for measuring and monitoring health status in the wild and outside of clinics. However, longitudinal, multimodal mobile sensor data can be small, noisy, and incomplete. This makes processing, modeling, and prediction of these data challenging. The small size of the data set restricts it from being modeled using complex deep learning networks. The current state of the art (SOTA) tackles small sensor data sets following a singular modeling paradigm based on traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms. These opt for either a user-agnostic modeling approach, making the model susceptible to a larger degree of noise, or a personalized approach, where training on individual data alludes to a more limited data set, giving rise to overfitting, therefore, ultimately, having to seek a trade-off by choosing 1 of the 2 modeling approaches to reach predictions. Objective: The objective of this study was to filter, rank, and output the best predictions for small, multimodal, longitudinal sensor data using a framework that is designed to tackle data sets that are limited in size (particularly targeting health studies that use passive multimodal sensors) and that combines both user agnostic and personalized approaches, along with a combination of ranking strategies to filter predictions. Methods: In this paper, we introduced a novel ranking framework for longitudinal multimodal sensors (FLMS) to address challenges encountered in health studies involving passive multimodal sensors. Using the FLMS, we (1) built a tensor-based aggregation and ranking strategy for final interpretation, (2) processed various combinations of sensor fusions, and (3) balanced user-agnostic and personalized modeling approaches with appropriate cross-validation strategies. The performance of the FLMS was validated with the help of a real data set of adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder for the prediction of change in depression in the adolescent participants. Results: Predictions output by the proposed FLMS achieved a 7% increase in accuracy and a 13% increase in recall for the real data set. Experiments with existing SOTA ML algorithms showed an 11% increase in accuracy for the depression data set and how overfitting and sparsity were handled. Conclusions: The FLMS aims to fill the gap that currently exists when modeling passive sensor data with a small number of data points. It achieves this through leveraging both user-agnostic and personalized modeling techniques in tandem with an effective ranking strategy to filter predictions.",10.2196/47805,2,Scopus,105006915635,2-s2.0-105006915635,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105006915635
Predicting stress levels for smartphone users using transfer learning induced residual net,Saha S.,2024,Entertainment Computing,"Smartphones have become an essential part of our daily lives, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when most people are forced to stay at home. This resulted in increased reliance on smartphones for education. Restricted body movements and continuous looking at phone-screens started gradually degrading the mental health especially for children and teenagers. The real-time measurement of stress levels (SLs) generated due to chronic exposure to screens becomes interesting study for the psychologists. Still, there exist void in linking the outcomes found by psychologists with automatic facial-expression-classification (FEC) from technical background. In the current study, the phone users’ SL is recognized by analyzing their facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Network. But it is observed that the accuracy gets saturated after certain iterations. This problem is addressed by introducing skip-connections into the architecture and implementing Residual Network. After successful completion of the SL classification, the authors delve into analyzing the training and validation errors with respect to human level performance. It is found that the system is suffering from overfitting. One way to address this issue is to feed more data to the system by Transfer Learning. The proposed work has a potential to open up a new avenue of SL measurement.",10.1016/j.entcom.2023.100609,1,Scopus,85174332238,2-s2.0-85174332238,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174332238

Operationalizing AI Regulatory Sandboxes for Children’s Rights and Well-Being,Charisi V.,2024,Human Centered AI A Multidisciplinary Perspective for Policy Makers Auditors and Users,"Children and youth are surrounded by AI in many of the products they use in their daily lives, from social media to education technology, video games, smart toys, and voice assistants. AI can affect the videos children watch online, their curriculum as they learn, and the way they play, and interact with others. For the purposes of this chapter, we adopt UNICEF’s definition of AI. AI can be used to facilitate children’s development and empower them in their activities, but children are also vulnerable to potential risks posed by AI, including bias, cybersecurity, data protection and privacy, and lack of accessibility. AI must be designed to respect the rights of the child user and to provide equal opportunities for all children. Several organizations, including UNICEF and the World Economic Forum (WEF), have developed guidelines for child-centric AI, but the challenge of designing and implementing responsible and trusted child-centered AI remains complex to address.

Diagnosis of ADHD using virtual reality and artificial intelligence: an exploratory study of clinical applications,Oh S.,2024,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: Diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is based on clinical evaluation of symptoms by a psychiatrist, referencing results of psychological tests. When diagnosing ADHD, the child’s behavior and functionality in real-life situations are critical components. However, direct observation by a clinician is often not feasible in practice. Therefore, such information is typically gathered from primary caregivers or teachers, which can introduce subjective elements. To overcome these limitations, we developed AttnKare-D, an innovative digital diagnostic tool that could analyze children’s behavioral data in Virtual Reality using Artificial Intelligence. The purpose of this study was to explore the utility and safety of AttnKare-D for clinical application. Method: A total of 21 children aged between 6 and 12 years were recruited for this study. Among them, 15 were children diagnosed with ADHD, 5 were part of a normal control group, and 1 child was excluded due to withdrawal of consent. Psychological assessments, including K-WISC, Conners CPT, K-ARS, and K-CBCL, were conducted for participants and their primary caregivers. Diagnoses of ADHD were confirmed by child and adolescent psychiatrists based on comprehensive face-to-face evaluations and results of psychological assessments. Participants underwent VR diagnostic assessment by performing various cognitive and behavioral tasks in a VR environment. Collected data were analyzed using an AI model to assess ADHD diagnosis and the severity of symptoms. Results: AttnKare-D demonstrated diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.893 when compared to diagnoses made by child and adolescent psychiatrist, showing a sensitivity of 0.8 and a specificity of 1.0 at a cut-off score of 18.44. AttnKare-D scores showed a high correlation with K-ARS scores rated by parents and experts, although the correlation was relatively low for inattention scores. Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that AttnKare-D can be a useful tool for diagnosing ADHD in children. This approach has potential to overcome limitations of current diagnostic methods, enhancing the accuracy and objectivity of ADHD diagnoses. This study lays the groundwork for further improvement and research on diagnostic tools integrating VR and AI technologies.

We selected various ML-based models with hyperparameter tuning in the discovery and performed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis in the train, test, and external validation data. Results: The study data set included 299,468 (KYRBS; original data set) and 833 (KNHANES; external validation data set) patients with AR recruited between 2005 and 2022. The best-performing ML model was the random forest model with a mean AUROC of 84.12% (95% CI 83.98%-84.27%) in the original data set. Applying this result to the external validation data set revealed the best performance among the models, with an AUROC of 89.87% (sensitivity 83.33%, specificity 82.58%, accuracy 82.59%, and balanced accuracy 82.96%). While looking at feature importance, the 5 most important features in predicting suicide attempts in adolescent patients with AR are depression, stress status, academic achievement, age, and alcohol consumption. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the potential of ML models in predicting suicide risks in patients with AR, encouraging further application of these models in other conditions to enhance adolescent health and decrease suicide rates.",10.2196/51473,25,Scopus,85185207852,2-s2.0-85185207852,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185207852
Machine-Learning Model Identifies Patients With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Using Claims Records,Sharma R.,2024,Copd Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Identifying patients with rare diseases like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is challenging. Machine-learning models may be trained to identify patients with rare diseases using large-scale, real-world databases, whereas electronic medical records have low numbers of confirmed cases and have limited use in training such models. We applied a machine-learning model to a large US claims database to identify undiagnosed symptomatic patients with AATD. Using deidentified data from the Komodo US claims database (April 26, 2016–January 31, 2023), a model was trained to identify symptomatic patients with high probability of AATD. Eighty claims records for high-probability candidates identified by the model were independently reviewed and validated by 2 clinical experts. The experts independently indicated that of the 80 high-probability candidate patients, 65 (81%) and 62 (78%) patients, respectively, should be tested for AATD. Feedback from this validation step informed model optimization. The optimized model was applied to claims data to identify symptomatic patients with probable AATD. Eleven and 14 “features” of the claims data were informative in distinguishing patients with AATD from patients with COPD without AATD and from unspecified chronic liver diseases. Moreover, patients with diagnosed AATD and COPD without AATD had unique cadences of similar medical events in their diagnostic journeys. Our work shows that a machine-learning model trained on a large US claims database can accurately identify symptomatic patients with AATD and provides useful insights into the diagnostic journey of patients with AATD.",10.1080/15412555.2024.2393348,2,Scopus,85204761269,2-s2.0-85204761269,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204761269
Socio-emotional and academic impact of confinement on first-year students of careers of the Faculty of Sciences of the Universidad de Valparaíso,Herrera Albornoz P.,2024,Cogent Education,"In the present study we dig into those post-confinement socioemotional factors that affect the academic competencies of students to the Science Faculty of the Universidad de Valparaíso. Learning conditions of these students in the previous years of their university life were completely online, interrupting normal socialization, at a key age of their neurodevelopment. A self-perception survey was applied to identify those factors that currently affect the students’ socioemotional processes with special attention on those related with academic performance. This is a quantitative study with a correlational descriptive scope. The study population consisted of 150 individuals admitted in 2021 and 2022. For the analysis of the results obtained from the survey on a Likert scale, associations were made according to the results of the Pearson correlation matrix. To the open questions, a NLP (Natural Language Processing) analysis was implemented, which consisted of counting words. Following the results of the survey, changes in teaching and learning strategies were implemented, which allowed improving the socioemotional gaps detected among students, improving their academic performance and perception of the contents addressed by the academics of the different subjects. Results drove us to the design of opportune academic strategies which tried to facilitate the transit to face-to-face learning and university life, safeguarding the students’ proper training process.",10.1080/2331186X.2024.2355388,2,Scopus,85195389634,2-s2.0-85195389634,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195389634
Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Depression through Digital Tools: Case Study in Adolescent,Gil Llanes O.F.,2024,Ceur Workshop Proceedings,"Depression is a global challenge that ranks second in years lived with disability. During adolescence, physical, cognitive, and psychosocial changes occur that are associated with an increase in de-pressive symptoms. These symptoms are often addressed by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) due to its proven efficacy. The advance of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and serious video games expanded the possibilities of including digital tools in intervention models, with CBT being the best adapted to new technologies due to its structure. In this context, the present study proposes the design of an intervention based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, using Beck's cognitive model of depression adapted to the use of digital tools such as artificial intelligence (ChatGPT), the development of video games (GDevelop) and the metaverse (Spatial) for the application of techniques and concepts described in the treatment of depressive symptomatology. For this, a study was conducted for External Psychological Support Service at Faculty of Psychology of the Autonomous University of Yucatan, with two adolescent volunteers with depressive symptoms according to the scores obtained in the DASS 21 and Hamilton instruments and the observation of negative thoughts and cognitive distortions by the therapist. For this intervention, ChatGPT was used to create scripts and elaborate children's psychoeducational videos adapted to girls and boys for the treatment of depression. It also made it possible to find free digital tools that could be used for psychoeducational purposes, such as Adobe Express (video animation), Narakeet (text-to-speech reading), Spatial (video exhibition) and GDevelop (video game development). During the intervention, a laptop with a word processor (Word) was used to present a serious video game developed in GDevelop and programmed to explain Beck's cognitive triad for depression. The results of this study indicate that the use of these digital tools for the treatment of depression are comparable to those obtained through the delivery of traditional therapy. At the same time, they can be applied to physical and/or virtual psychological therapies. Also, they can provide real-time feedback to the user during use, as in the case of serious video games. However, further research is needed on the use of digital tools in psychotherapeutic interventions and to know how effective these tools can be in reducing depressive symptomatology in adolescents.",,0,Scopus,85197265875,2-s2.0-85197265875,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197265875
Machine Learning Based ERP P300 Classification in EEG Signals from Online Game Player Performing GNAT Test,Kusumawardani S.A.,2024,7th International Seminar on Research of Information Technology and Intelligent Systems Advanced Intelligent Systems in Contemporary Society Isriti 2024 Proceedings,"Online Game Disorder (OGD) is a behavioral disorder characterized by excessive online gaming, which disrupts an individual's daily life. Adolescents demonstrate a correlation between OGD and depression, as frequent gaming coincides with increased depressive symptoms. This research utilizes the Electroencephalography (EEG) method, which records electrical activity in the brain. Adolescents diagnosed with OGD will have their brain signals recorded, and the resulting EEG signals will undergo analysis. The analysis employs the Event-Related Potential (ERP) technique, explicitly targeting the P300 component, which occurs within a 200-500 ms window following the presentation of a stimulus from Go/No Go Association Task (GNAT). Classification is conducted using machine learning by comparing two machine learning models and three feature orders. The classification methods used are the random forest and decision tree models. The classification process involves two labels: the presence of the P300 ERP and the absence of the P300 ERP. These labels are inputted into the machine learning models for classification, with the resulting output used to compare the performance of the two models across different feature orders. The highest accuracy was achieved using the decision tree model with a combined feature set of first-order and second-order statistics, resulting in an accuracy of 92.42%. Performance parameters support this result, specifically with a precision of 78%, recall of 93%, and an F1-score of 85%. Although the decision tree model achieved the highest accuracy, the random forest model demonstrated more stable results.",10.1109/ISRITI64779.2024.10963621,0,Scopus,105004409311,2-s2.0-105004409311,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004409311
Complementary Therapies and Factors Related to Dysmenorrhoea in Adolescents: A Bibliometric Analysis,Rejeki S.,2024,Scripta Medica Banja Luka,"Complementary therapies for decreasing dysmenorrhoea and factors behind dysmenorrhoea in adolescents is not clear enough. Researchers need information about trends and novelties for the future research topic of complementary therapies and factors related to dysmenorrhoea in adoles-cents. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the complementary therapies for decreasing dysmenorrhoea and factors related to dysmen-orrhoea in adolescents by analysing network visualisation, overlay visuali-sation and density visualisation on the topic through bibliometric analysis. The data sources used in this study were based on online searches via https://app.dimensions.ai/. The literature search used the stages following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart. Paper restricted in publications years 2014-2023, fo-cus in the field of health sciences, nursing, public health, clinical sciences and publication type were included as criteria for inclusion in the study. The data were analysed using VOSviewer. After identifying the clusters, the types of complementary therapies that were able to reduce dysmen-orrhoea were acupressure, acupuncture, calcium sufficiency, curcumin, yoga, aromatherapy, massage and physical activity. Moreover, factors related to dysmenorrhoea were HIV, reproductive coercion, reproductive health, oxytocin, prolactin, trauma, metformin, anxiety and breast cancer. Moreover, the newest topics that were being widely researched related to adolescent dysmenorrhoea were education, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), prolactin and physical activity. On the other hand, topics that were rarely researched related to the topic of adolescent dysmenorrhoea were topics about sexual health, reproductive coercion, inflammation, curcumin and physical activity. Complementary therapies and factors that are still rarely studied offer potential novelty in results in future studies.",10.5937/scriptamed55-45880,4,Scopus,85185977469,2-s2.0-85185977469,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185977469

MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHILD POVERTY IN CHILE: Dimensions That Matter for Child Development,Telias A.,2024,Routledge Handbook of Child and Family Social Work Research Knowledge Building Application and Impact,"The negative consequences of child poverty on well-being in the short and long terms have been well documented, as well as the social costs that it implies. There is a broad consensus both on its multidimensional characteristic and the importance of eradicating it. However, there is less consensus regarding which dimensions of child poverty should be considered to conceptualize and measure child poverty and what the best social policies for its eradication are. This research aims to identify the child poverty indicators that are the best predictors of children’s development, to contribute to the debate regarding the conceptualization and measurement of child poverty. We use data from the Longitudinal Survey of Early Childhood in the middle-high-income country of Chile, where income and multidimensional poverty has reduced over time but is, however, more prevalent for children. Using machine learning techniques, we identify, from among the indicators used to measure multidimensional poverty in Chile and also considering other indicators relevant to measure child well-being, the best predictors of children’s development (measured as language development). We found that the best predictors of children’s development are parental education followed by access to a computer. On a second level, access to the internet and easy access to water predicted higher language development while overcrowding and harsh parenting were associated with lower levels of language development. Going beyond the indicators used by the official MPI, these results show new material and immaterial indicators as relevant for children. These indicators should not only be considered at the moment in the design of a multidimensional poverty measurement method with a focus on children, but they should also be considered in the current social protection system for children and adolescents in order to prevent the negative consequences of poverty in the mid and long terms.",10.4324/9781003241492-12,0,Scopus,85210877932,2-s2.0-85210877932,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210877932
Clinical Decision Support System Used in Spinal Disorders: Scoping Review,Toh Z.A.,2024,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Spinal disorders are highly prevalent worldwide with high socioeconomic costs. This cost is associated with the demand for treatment and productivity loss, prompting the exploration of technologies to improve patient outcomes. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are computerized systems that are increasingly used to facilitate safe and efficient health care. Their applications range in depth and can be found across health care specialties. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore the use of CDSSs in patients with spinal disorders. Methods: We used the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidance for this scoping review and reported according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) statement. Databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and PsycINFO, were searched from inception until October 11, 2022. The included studies examined the use of digitalized CDSSs in patients with spinal disorders. Results: A total of 4 major CDSS functions were identified from 31 studies: preventing unnecessary imaging (n=8, 26%), aiding diagnosis (n=6, 19%), aiding prognosis (n=11, 35%), and recommending treatment options (n=6, 20%). Most studies used the knowledge-based system. Logistic regression was the most commonly used method, followed by decision tree algorithms. The use of CDSSs to aid in the management of spinal disorders was generally accepted over the threat to physicians’ clinical decision-making autonomy. Conclusions: Although the effectiveness was frequently evaluated by examining the agreement between the decisions made by the CDSSs and the health care providers, comparing the CDSS recommendations with actual clinical outcomes would be preferable. In addition, future studies on CDSS development should focus on system integration, considering end user’s needs and preferences, and external validation and impact studies to assess effectiveness and generalizability.",10.2196/53951,6,Scopus,85188308704,2-s2.0-85188308704,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188308704
Machine learning identifies a COVID-19-specific phenotype in university students using a mental health app,Shvetcov A.,2023,Internet Interventions,"Background: Advances in smartphone technology have allowed people to access mental healthcare via digital apps from wherever and whenever they choose. University students experience a high burden of mental health concerns. Although these apps improve mental health symptoms, user engagement has remained low. Studies have shown that users can be subgrouped based on unique characteristics that just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) can use to improve engagement. To date, however, no studies have examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on these subgroups. Objective: Here, we sought to examine user subgroup characteristics across three COVID-19-specific timepoints: during lockdown, immediately following lockdown, and three months after lockdown ended. Methods: To do this, we used a two-step machine learning approach combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning. Results: We demonstrate that there are three unique subgroups of university students who access mental health apps. Two of these, with either higher or lower mental well-being, were defined by characteristics that were stable across COVID-19 timepoints. The third, situational well-being, had characteristics that were timepoint-dependent, suggesting that they are highly influenced by traumatic stressors and stressful situations. This subgroup also showed feelings and behaviours consistent with burnout. Conclusions: Overall, our findings clearly suggest that user subgroups are unique: they have different characteristics and therefore likely have different mental healthcare goals. Our findings also highlight the importance of including questions and additional interventions targeting traumatic stress(ors), reason(s) for use, and burnout in JITAI-style mental health apps to improve engagement.",10.1016/j.invent.2023.100666,8,Scopus,85170636847,2-s2.0-85170636847,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170636847
Investigating the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK university: a machine learning approach using feature permutation importance,Chen T.,2023,Brain Informatics,"Mental wellbeing of university students is a growing concern that has been worsening during the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous studies have gathered empirical data to explore the mental health impact of the pandemic on university students and investigate factors associated with higher levels of distress. While the online questionnaire survey has been a prevalent means to collect data, regression analysis has been observed a dominating approach to interpret and understand the impact of independent factors on a mental wellbeing state of interest. Drawbacks such as sensitivity to outliers, ineffectiveness in case of multiple predictors highly correlated may limit the use of regression in complex scenarios. These observations motivate the underlying research to propose alternative computational methods to investigate the questionnaire data. Inspired by recent machine learning advances, this research aims to construct a framework through feature permutation importance to empower the application of a variety of machine learning algorithms that originate from different computational frameworks and learning theories, including algorithms that cannot directly provide exact numerical contributions of individual factors. This would enable to explore quantitative impact of predictors in influencing student mental wellbeing from multiple perspectives as a result of using different algorithms, thus complementing the single view due to the dominant use of regression. Applying the proposed approach over an online survey in a UK university, the analysis suggests the past medical record and wellbeing history and the experience of adversity contribute significantly to mental wellbeing states; and the frequent communication with families and friends to keep good relationship as well as regular exercise are generally contributing to improved mental wellbeing.",10.1186/s40708-023-00205-8,9,Scopus,85173608853,2-s2.0-85173608853,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173608853
Monitoring sleep using smartphone data in a population of college students,Langholm C.,2023,Npj Mental Health Research,"Sleep is fundamental to all health, especially mental health. Monitoring sleep is thus critical to delivering effective healthcare. However, measuring sleep in a scalable way remains a clinical challenge because wearable sleep-monitoring devices are not affordable or accessible to the majority of the population. However, as consumer devices like smartphones become increasingly powerful and accessible in the United States, monitoring sleep using smartphone patterns offers a feasible and scalable alternative to wearable devices. In this study, we analyze the sleep behavior of 67 college students with elevated levels of stress over 28 days. While using the open-source mindLAMP smartphone app to complete daily and weekly sleep and mental health surveys, these participants also passively collected phone sensor data. We used these passive sensor data streams to estimate sleep duration. These sensor-based sleep duration estimates, when averaged for each participant, were correlated with self-reported sleep duration (r = 0.83). We later constructed a simple predictive model using both sensor-based sleep duration estimates and surveys as predictor variables. This model demonstrated the ability to predict survey-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores within 1 point. Overall, our results suggest that smartphone-derived sleep duration estimates offer practical results for estimating sleep duration and can also serve useful functions in the process of digital phenotyping.",10.1038/s44184-023-00023-0,6,Scopus,105004769024,2-s2.0-105004769024,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004769024
A randomized controlled trial on using predictive algorithm to adapt level of psychological care for community college students: STAND triaging and adapting to level of care study protocol,Wen A.,2023,Trials,"Background: There is growing interest in using personalized mental health care to treat disorders like depression and anxiety to improve treatment engagement and efficacy. This randomized controlled trial will compare a traditional symptom severity decision-making algorithm to a novel multivariate decision-making algorithm for triage to and adaptation of mental health care. The stratified levels of care include a self-guided online wellness program, coach-guided online cognitive behavioral therapy, and clinician-delivered psychotherapy with or without pharmacotherapy. The novel multivariate algorithm will be comprised of baseline (for triage and adaptation) and time-varying variables (for adaptation) in four areas: social determinants of mental health, early adversity and life stressors, predisposing, enabling, and need influences on health service use, and comprehensive mental health status. The overarching goal is to evaluate whether the multivariate algorithm improves adherence to treatment, symptoms, and functioning above and beyond the symptom-based algorithm. Methods/design: This trial will recruit a total of 1000 participants over the course of 5 years in the greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. Participants will be recruited from a highly diverse sample of community college students. For the symptom severity approach, initial triaging to level of care will be based on symptom severity, whereas for the multivariate approach, the triaging will be based on a comprehensive set of baseline measures. After the initial triaging, level of care will be adapted throughout the duration of the treatment, utilizing either symptom severity or multivariate statistical approaches. Participants will complete computerized assessments and self-report questionnaires at baseline and up to 40 weeks. The multivariate decision-making algorithm will be updated annually to improve predictive outcomes. Discussion: Results will provide a comparison on the traditional symptom severity decision-making and the novel multivariate decision-making with respect to treatment adherence, symptom improvement, and functional recovery. Moreover, the developed multivariate decision-making algorithms may be used as a template in other community college settings. Ultimately, findings will inform the practice of level of care triage and adaptation in psychological treatments, as well as the use of personalized mental health care broadly.

Digital Phenotyping Models of Symptom Improvement in College Mental Health: Generalizability Across Two Cohorts,Currey D.,2023,Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science,"Smartphones can be used to gain insight into mental health conditions through the collection of survey and sensor data. However, the external validity of this digital phenotyping data is still being explored, and there is a need to assess if predictive models derived from this data are generalizable. The first dataset (V1) of 632 college students was collected between December 2020 and May 2021. The second dataset (V2) was collected using the same app between November and December 2021 and included 66 students. Students in V1 could enroll in V2. The main difference between the V1 and V2 studies was that we focused on protocol methods in V2 to ensure digital phenotyping data had a lower degree of missing data than in the V1 dataset. We compared survey response counts and sensor data coverage across the two datasets. Additionally, we explored whether models trained to predict symptom survey improvement could generalize across datasets. Design changes in V2, such as a run-in period and data quality checks, resulted in significantly higher engagement and sensor data coverage. The best-performing model was able to predict a 50% change in mood with 28 days of data, and models were able to generalize across datasets. The similarities between the features in V1 and V2 suggest that our features are valid across time. In addition, models must be able to generalize to new populations to be used in practice, so our experiments provide an encouraging result toward the potential of personalized digital mental health care.",10.1007/s41347-023-00310-9,4,Scopus,85149146253,2-s2.0-85149146253,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149146253
"A Smart Service System for Spatial Intelligence and Onboard Navigation for Individuals with Visual Impairment (VIS4ION Thailand): study protocol of a randomized controlled trial of visually impaired students at the Ratchasuda College, Thailand",Beheshti M.,2023,Trials,"Background: Blind/low vision (BLV) severely limits information about our three-dimensional world, leading to poor spatial cognition and impaired navigation. BLV engenders mobility losses, debility, illness, and premature mortality. These mobility losses have been associated with unemployment and severe compromises in quality of life. VI not only eviscerates mobility and safety but also, creates barriers to inclusive higher education. Although true in almost every high-income country, these startling facts are even more severe in low- and middle-income countries, such as Thailand. We aim to use VIS<sup>4</sup>ION (Visually Impaired Smart Service System for Spatial Intelligence and Onboard Navigation), an advanced wearable technology, to enable real-time access to microservices, providing a potential solution to close this gap and deliver consistent and reliable access to critical spatial information needed for mobility and orientation during navigation. Methods: We are leveraging 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation techniques to create a digital twin of the campus that houses Mahidol University’s disability college. We will do cross-over randomization, and two groups of randomized VI students will deploy this augmented platform in two phases: a passive phase, during which the wearable will only record location, and an active phase, in which end users receive orientation cueing during location recording. A group will perform the active phase first, then the passive, and the other group will experiment reciprocally. We will assess for acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility, focusing on experiences with VIS<sup>4</sup>ION. In addition, we will test another cohort of students for navigational, health, and well-being improvements, comparing weeks 1 to 4. We will also conduct a process evaluation according to the Saunders Framework. Finally, we will extend our computer vision and digital twinning technique to a 12-block spatial grid in Bangkok, providing aid in a more complex environment. Discussion: Although electronic navigation aids seem like an attractive solution, there are several barriers to their use; chief among them is their dependence on either environmental (sensor-based) infrastructure or WiFi/cell “connectivity” infrastructure or both. These barriers limit their widespread adoption, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries. Here we propose a navigation solution that operates independently of both environmental and Wi-Fi/cell infrastructure. We predict the proposed platform supports spatial cognition in BLV populations, augmenting personal freedom and agency, and promoting health and well-being.

Using digital phenotyping to capture depression symptom variability: detecting naturalistic variability in depression symptoms across one year using passively collected wearable movement and sleep data,Price G.D.,2023,Translational Psychiatry,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) presents considerable challenges to diagnosis and management due to symptom variability across time. Only recent work has highlighted the clinical implications for interrogating depression symptom variability. Thus, the present work investigates how sociodemographic, comorbidity, movement, and sleep data is associated with long-term depression symptom variability. Participant information included (N = 939) baseline sociodemographic and comorbidity data, longitudinal, passively collected wearable data, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores collected over 12 months. An ensemble machine learning approach was used to detect long-term depression symptom variability via: (i) a domain-driven feature selection approach and (ii) an exhaustive feature-inclusion approach. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interrogate variable importance and directionality.

"A mixed-methods feasibility study of a novel AI-enabled, web-based, clinical decision support system for the treatment of major depression in adults",Qassim S.,2023,Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,"Background: The objective of this paper is to discuss perceived clinical utility and impact on physician-patient relationship of a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled clinical decision support system (CDSS) for use in treating adults with major depression. Methods: A single arm, naturalistic follow-up study aimed at assessing the acceptability and useability of the software. Patients had a baseline appointment, followed by a minimum of two appointments with the CDSS. Study exit questionnaires and interviews were conducted to assess perceived clinical utility, impact on patient-physician relationship, and understanding and trust. 7 physicians and 17 patients, of which 14 completed, consented to participate. Results: 86 % of physicians (6/7) felt the information provided by the CDSS provided more comprehensive understanding of patient situations. 71 % (5/7) felt the information was helpful. 86 % of physicians (6/7) reported the AI/predictive model was useful when deciding treatment. 62 % of patients (8/13) reported improved care due to the tool, and 46 %(6/13) reported a significantly or somewhat improved physician-patient relationship 54 % reported no change. 71 % of physicians (5/7) and 62 % of patients (8/13) rated trusting the tool. Limitations: Small sample size and treatment changes prior to CDSS introduction limits ability to verify impact on outcomes. Conclusions: Qualitative results from 12 patient exit interviews are analyzed and presented. Findings suggest physicians perceived the tool as useful in conducting appointments and used it while deciding treatment. Physicians and patients generally found the tool trustworthy, and it may have positive effects on physician-patient relationships.

Natural language processing for mental health interventions: a systematic review and research framework,Malgaroli M.,2023,Translational Psychiatry,"Neuropsychiatric disorders pose a high societal cost, but their treatment is hindered by lack of objective outcomes and fidelity metrics. AI technologies and specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) have emerged as tools to study mental health interventions (MHI) at the level of their constituent conversations. However, NLP’s potential to address clinical and research challenges remains unclear. We therefore conducted a pre-registered systematic review of NLP-MHI studies using PRISMA guidelines (osf.io/s52jh) to evaluate their models, clinical applications, and to identify biases and gaps. Candidate studies (n = 19,756), including peer-reviewed AI conference manuscripts, were collected up to January 2023 through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ArXiv. A total of 102 articles were included to investigate their computational characteristics (NLP algorithms, audio features, machine learning pipelines, outcome metrics), clinical characteristics (clinical ground truths, study samples, clinical focus), and limitations. Results indicate a rapid growth of NLP MHI studies since 2019, characterized by increased sample sizes and use of large language models. Digital health platforms were the largest providers of MHI data. Ground truth for supervised learning models was based on clinician ratings (n = 31), patient self-report (n = 29) and annotations by raters (n = 26). Text-based features contributed more to model accuracy than audio markers. Patients’ clinical presentation (n = 34), response to intervention (n = 11), intervention monitoring (n = 20), providers’ characteristics (n = 12), relational dynamics (n = 14), and data preparation (n = 4) were commonly investigated clinical categories. Limitations of reviewed studies included lack of linguistic diversity, limited reproducibility, and population bias. A research framework is developed and validated (NLPxMHI) to assist computational and clinical researchers in addressing the remaining gaps in applying NLP to MHI, with the goal of improving clinical utility, data access, and fairness.",10.1038/s41398-023-02592-2,89,Scopus,85173784681,2-s2.0-85173784681,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173784681
Development and codesign of flourish: A digital suicide prevention intervention for LGBTQ+ youth who have experienced online victimization,Biernesser C.,2023,Internet Interventions,"Background: LGBTQ+ youth experience disproportionately high rates of online victimization (OV), referring to harmful remarks, images, or behaviors in online settings, which is associated with suicidal risk. Current services have gaps in supporting LGBTQ+ youth facing OV events. To address these gaps, this study aims to develop Flourish, a digital suicide prevention intervention for LGBTQ+ youth who have experienced OV. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 LGBTQ+ youth with past-year history of OV and lifetime history of suicidality, 11 of their parents, and 10 LGBTQ+-serving professionals. Subsequently, an iterative codesign process was conducted with 22 youth through individual and group design sessions, followed by usability testing. Data were recorded and transcribed. Qualitative interviews were analyzed using a qualitative description approach, and data from design sessions and usability testing were analyzed using rapid qualitative techniques. Results: Interviews with youth, parents, and professionals suggested preferences for Flourish to be a partially automated, text message intervention leveraging web-based content that is a safe space for LGBTQ+ youth to seek support for OV through education, coping skills, and help-seeking resources. School and mental health services professionals considered the potential for implementing Flourish within youth services settings. Usability testing, assessed through the System Usability Scale, yielded an average rating of 91, indicating excellent perceived usability. Conclusions: Flourish has potential to be an acceptable intervention to support LGBTQ+ youth following OV. Future steps will include testing the feasibility and efficacy of Flourish and further examining Flourish's potential for implementation within services for LGBTQ+ youth.",10.1016/j.invent.2023.100663,9,Scopus,85169540858,2-s2.0-85169540858,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169540858
the associated factors of suicide attempt in French sexual minority adolescents,Wang X.X.,2023,Minerva Psychiatry,"BacKGrOUND: sexual minority adolescents have greater risk for suicide attempt (sa) than heterosexual youth. however, research on risk and protective factors is lacking in sexual minority youth. in this study, we aimed to identify novel risk and protective factors for suicide attempt using machine learning decision tree method. MethODs: the French cross-sectional study Portraits d’adolescents included 14,265 aged 13-20 years old adolescents. Decision tree algorithm was used to predict sa and to compare the different risk and protective factors between sexual minority youth and heterosexual peers. RESULTS: Twenty predictive factors were identified among the 70 survey fields output from the predictive modeling for sa. substance consumptions were among the top risk factors for sa. Parental support was an important protective factor among all adolescents regardless of sexual orientation. interestingly, through the decision tree, real-life friend support was found protective in heterosexual youth, online friend support was a protective factor in homosexual adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Using the decision tree-based algorithm, we not only verified those important protective factors that were demonstrated in existing studies, but also discovered novel protective and attributive factors, such as real-life and online friend support.

“A Great Way to Start the Conversation”: Evidence for the Use of an Adolescent Mental Health Chatbot Navigator for Youth at Risk of HIV and Other STIs,Sanabria G.,2023,Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science,"Chatbot use is increasing for mobile health interventions on sensitive and stigmatized topics like mental health because of their anonymity and privacy. This anonymity provides acceptability to sexual and gendered minority youth (ages 16–24) at increased risk of HIV and other STIs with poor mental health due to higher levels of stigma, discrimination, and social isolation. This study evaluates the usability of Tabatha-YYC, a pilot chatbot navigator created to link these youth to mental health resources. Tabatha-YYC was developed using a Youth Advisory Board (n = 7). The final design underwent user testing (n = 20) through a think-aloud protocol, semi-structured interview, and a brief survey post-exposure which included the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale. The chatbot was found to be an acceptable mental health navigator by participants. This study provides important design methodology considerations and key insights into chatbot design preferences of youth at risk of STIs seeking mental health resources.",10.1007/s41347-023-00315-4,9,Scopus,85159115973,2-s2.0-85159115973,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159115973
Evaluating a treatment selection approach for online single-session interventions for adolescent depression,Ahuvia I.L.,2023,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines,"Background: The question ‘what works for whom’ is essential to mental health research, as matching individuals to the treatment best suited to their needs has the potential to maximize the effectiveness of existing approaches. Digitally administered single-session interventions (SSIs) are effective means of reducing depressive symptoms in adolescence, with potential for rapid, large-scale implementation. However, little is known about which SSIs work best for different adolescents. Objective: We created and tested a treatment selection algorithm for use with two SSIs targeting depression in high-symptom adolescents from across the United States. Methods: Using data from a large-scale RCT comparing two evidence-based SSIs (N = 996; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04634903), we utilized a Personalized Advantage Index approach to create and evaluate a treatment-matching algorithm for these interventions. The two interventions were Project Personality (PP; N = 482), an intervention teaching that traits and symptoms are malleable (a ‘growth mindset’), and the Action Brings Change Project (ABC; N = 514), a behavioral activation intervention. Results: Results indicated no significant difference in 3-month depression outcomes between participants assigned to their matched intervention and those assigned to their nonmatched intervention. The relationship between predicted response to intervention (RTI) and observed RTI was weak for both interventions (r =.39 for PP, r =.24 for ABC). Moreover, the correlation between a participants' predicted RTI for PP and their predicted RTI for ABC was very high (r =.79). Conclusions: The utility of treatment selection approaches for SSIs targeting adolescent depression appears limited. Results suggest that both (a) predicting RTI for SSIs is relatively challenging, and (b) the factors that predict RTI for SSIs are similar regardless of the content of the intervention. Given their overall effectiveness and their low-intensity, low-cost nature, increasing youths' access to both digital SSIs may carry more public health utility than additional treatment-matching efforts.",10.1111/jcpp.13822,10,Scopus,85159193692,2-s2.0-85159193692,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159193692
Adapting a transdiagnostic digital mental health intervention for use among immigrant and refugee youth in Seattle: a human-centered design approach,Fabian K.E.,2023,Translational Behavioral Medicine,"Digital mental health interventions show promise in addressing mental health needs, especially among youth and marginalized communities. This study adapted the World Health Organization -developed STARS (Sustainable Technology for Adolescents to Reduce Stress) digital mental health intervention for use among youth and young adults aged 14–25 from immigrant and refugee communities in Seattle, Washington. Human-centered design methods centered around qualitative semi-structured interviews were used to contextually and culturally adapt the intervention and prioritize the needs and preferences of the intended end user. Intervention prototypes were modified and then presented to the target groups in iterative cycles until saturation was achieved. Qualitative interviews occurred in three iterations of five participants each. Modifications were documented according to the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications—Expanded (FRAME) implementation science framework. Modifications aligned with the FRAME process elements: (a) tailoring/refining, which included adapting language to less resemble digital phishing scams; (b) changes in packaging or materials, which included naming the chatbot and adopting a corresponding avatar; (c) adding/removing, which included changing existing emojis and adding additional media types including graphics interchange format images, pictures, and voice memos; (d) shortening/condensing, which included shortening the length of individual text sections as well as deleting redundant language; (e) lengthening/extending, which included allowing the user to choose to receive content catered to teenagers or to adults; and (f) loosening structure, including giving users options to skip parts of modules or to engage with additional material. The modified STARS intervention shows promise for engagement with immigrant and refugee youth in Seattle and can be examined for clinical effectiveness. Adaptations increased the relevance of content to the intended end user, expanded options for personalization and customization of the user experience, and utilized language that was age appropriate, engaging, and did not invoke feelings of stigma or distrust. Adaptations of digital mental health interventions should focus on modifications that maximize acceptability and appropriateness to intended audiences.",10.1093/tbm/ibad041,12,Scopus,85176507949,2-s2.0-85176507949,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176507949
"Using Machine Learning to Identify Predictors of Sexually Transmitted Infections Over Time Among Young People Living With or at Risk for HIV Who Participated in ATN Protocols 147, 148, and 149",Comulada W.S.,2023,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,"Background Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among youth aged 12 to 24 years have doubled in the last 13 years, accounting for 50% of STIs nationally. We need to identify predictors of STI among youth in urban HIV epicenters. Methods Sexual and gender minority (gay, bisexual, transgender, gender-diverse) and other youth with multiple life stressors (homelessness, incarceration, substance use, mental health disorders) were recruited from 13 sites in Los Angeles and New Orleans (N = 1482). Self-reports and rapid diagnostic tests for STI, HIV, and drug use were conducted at 4-month intervals for up to 24 months. Machine learning was used to identify predictors of time until new STI (including a new HIV diagnosis). Results At recruitment, 23.9% of youth had a current or past STI. Over 24 months, 19.3% tested positive for a new STI. Heterosexual males had the lowest STI rate (12%); African American youth were 23% more likely to acquire an STI compared with peers of other ethnicities. Time to STI was best predicted by attending group sex venues or parties, moderate but not high dating app use, and past STI and HIV seropositive status. Conclusions Sexually transmitted infections are concentrated among a subset of young people at highest risk. The best predictors of youth's risk are their sexual environments and networks.

Impact of mobile connectivity on students’ wellbeing: Detecting learners’ depression using machine learning algorithms,Siraji M.I.,2023,Plos One,"Depression is a psychological state of mind that often influences a person in an unfavorable manner. While it can occur in people of all ages, students are especially vulnerable to it throughout their academic careers. Beginning in 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic caused major problems in people’s lives by driving them into quarantine and forcing them to be connected continually with mobile devices, such that mobile connectivity became the new norm during the pandemic and beyond. This situation is further accelerated for students as universities move towards a blended learning mode. In these circumstances, monitoring student mental health in terms of mobile and Internet connectivity is crucial for their wellbeing. This study focuses on students attending an International University of Bangladesh to investigate their mental health due to their continual use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops etc.). A cross-sectional survey method was employed to collect data from 444 participants. Following the exploratory data analysis, eight machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to develop an automated normal-to-extreme severe depression identification and classification system. When the automated detection was incorporated with feature selection such as Chi-square test and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), about 3 to 5% increase in accuracy was observed by the method. Similarly, a 5 to 15% increase in accuracy has been observed when a feature extraction method such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed. Also, the SparsePCA feature extraction technique in combination with the CatBoost classifier showed the best results in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The data analysis revealed no sign of depression in about 44% of the total participants. About 25% of students showed mild-to-moderate and 31% of students showed severe-to-extreme signs of depression. The results suggest that ML models, incorporating a proper feature engineering method can serve adequately in multi-stage depression detection among the students. This model might be utilized in other disciplines for detecting early signs of depression among people.",10.1371/journal.pone.0294803,13,Scopus,85178037883,2-s2.0-85178037883,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178037883
Exploring the Association Between Opioid Use Disorder and Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Among a National Sample of the U.S. Population,Qeadan F.,2023,Journal of Alzheimer S Disease,"Background: Past research suggests associations between heavy alcohol use and later life dementia. However, little is known about whether opioid use disorder (OUD) and dementia share this association, especially among age groups younger than 65 years old. Objective: Examine the association between OUD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. Methods: Electronic health records between 2000 and 2021 for patients age 12 or older were identified in the Cerner Real-World database™. Patients with a prior diagnosis of dementia were excluded. Patients were followed for 1-10 years (grouped by one, three, five, and ten-year follow-up periods) in a matched retrospective cohort study. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of incident AD/dementia stratified by age and follow-up group. Results: A sample of 627,810 individuals with OUD were compared to 646,340 without OUD. Individuals with OUD exhibited 88% higher risk for developing AD/dementia compared to those without OUD (aHR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.74, 2.03) within 1 year follow-up and 211% (aHR = 3.11, 95% CI 2.63, 3.69) within 10 years follow-up. When stratifying by age, younger patients (age 12-44) had a greater disparity in odds of AD/dementia between OUD and non-OUD groups compared with patients older than 65 years. Conclusions: Additional research is needed to understand why an association exists between OUD and AD/dementia, especially among younger populations. The results suggest that cognitive functioning screening programs for younger people diagnosed with OUD may be useful for targeting early identification and intervention for AD/dementia in particularly high risk and marginalized populations.",10.3233/JAD-230714,2,Scopus,85175496914,2-s2.0-85175496914,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175496914

Neural Mixed Effects for Nonlinear Personalized Predictions,Wörtwein T.,2023,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that predicts a person's future observations based on their past labeled observations and is typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a) trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere in a neural network in a scalable manner1. NME combines the efficiency of neural network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the mothers experience symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states. Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset shows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms.",10.1145/3577190.3614115,6,Scopus,85175800125,2-s2.0-85175800125,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175800125
Prevalence and Association of Digital Eye Strain with the Quality of Sleep and Feeling of Loneliness among Female College Students in Northern India,Rana M.,2023,Indian Journal of Public Health,"Introduction: Because of COVID’s impact on social behavior, students have become more reliant on computer‑facilitated communication to continue their studies and interact with friends. While it is known that the association between screen exposure and psychological well‑being is both harmful and stronger among adolescents than younger children, what is less studied are the causal factors that may mediate the relationship. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to analyze the relationship between screen exposure and two psychological outcomes, sleep quality and loneliness, using digital eye strain as a mediating factor. Eye strain is expected to have a direct and harmful influence on psychological well‑being. Materials and Methods: A structured and validated questionnaire was transcribed and administered online. A nonrepresentative sample of 497 female college students in a North Indian city participated in the study. Digital eye strain, quality of sleep, and feeling of loneliness scores were assessed using latent class analysis. Results: The selected latent model suggested that Class 2 had a high percentage of students with network issues, the problem with space and noise, and various financial hardships, which had almost doubled the rate of loneliness (53.28%) and sleep–wake difficulties (75.41%) among the students affected with computer vision syndrome (89.75%). Conclusion: There is an urgent need to examine the implications of digital exposure across gender and age to prevent future complications.

Data mining-based innovative model for mental health of college students using IoT and big data analysis,Shen X.,2023,Soft Computing,"The mental health of college students not only affects their personal development but also impacts the environment of the campus. Moreover, it affects the harmony of the family and stability of the society. This phenomenon has attracted great attention from the society. New technological paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and data mining offer new opportunities to detect, assess, and care for the mental health of students early. This paper explains the psychological problems of college students and analyzes the application of IoT and data mining in the mental health of students. The contents of mental health in colleges are investigated, and big data techniques are employed to build an innovative model for students. First, an online psychological consulting platform is designed followed by online evaluation standards and online/offline teaching fusion courses to understand mental health. Next, a neural network algorithm is developed and trained on the datasets to accurately classify the contents of students' mental health, and the corresponding results are obtained. The model is evaluated in terms of accuracy. Results show that the proposed innovative model achieves better results with 88% accuracy. Through comparative analysis, it is demonstrated that the use of IoT and big data technology can provide technical support for the innovation of college student's mental health and education and can solve more problems efficiently.",10.1007/s00500-023-09083-y,6,Scopus,85168119427,2-s2.0-85168119427,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168119427
Association of Computer Vision Syndrome with Depression/Anxiety among Lebanese Young Adults: The Mediating Effect of Stress,Issa R.,2023,Healthcare Switzerland,"Computers have become indispensable in daily activities. With this excess use of electronics, computer vision syndrome (CVS), a highly prevalent condition, is associated with various symptoms. Although understanding the relationship between CVS and mental health has been reported, the impact of CVS has not been explored on more than one psychological aspect. We hypothesize that higher CVS symptoms could be associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, mediated by higher stress. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the association between CVS and depression and anxiety among a sample of Lebanese young adults, along with evaluating the mediating effect of stress on these associations. Between August 2020 and April 2021, 749 participants completed an online questionnaire for this cross-sectional study. Females compared to males (Beta = 3.73) and those with CVS compared to those who did not (Beta = 3.14) were significantly associated with more anxiety, whereas having a university level of education compared to secondary or less (Beta = −3.02) was significantly associated with less anxiety. Females compared to males (Beta = 2.55) and those with CVS compared to those without (Beta = 2.61) were significantly associated with more depression, whereas being of an older age (Beta = −0.18) was significantly associated with less depression. Stress partially mediated the association between CVS and anxiety and between CVS and depression. More CVS was significantly associated with more stress (Beta = 3.05). Higher stress was significantly associated with more anxiety (Beta = 0.70) and depression (Beta = 0.71), whereas more CVS was significantly and directly associated with more anxiety (Beta = 3.14) and depression (Beta = 2.61). This study is the first worldwide to evaluate an association between CVS and mental health. Our results serve as a starting point for healthcare providers (psychiatrists and psychologists, most importantly) to look deeper into CVS when looking for reasons behind mental health issues. Further studies are warranted to confirm our results and look for more factors and mediators in such associations.",10.3390/healthcare11192674,9,Scopus,85173865537,2-s2.0-85173865537,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173865537
Acceptability Criteria of Precision Medicine: Lessons from Patients' Experiences with the GUIDE-IBD Trial Regarding the Use of Mobile Health Technology,Erdmann A.,2023,Crohn S and Colitis 360,"Background: Research about mobile health technologies for inflammatory bowel diseases reveals that these devices are mainly used to predict or self-report disease activity. However, in the near future these tools can be used to integrate large data sets into machine learning for the development of personalized treatment algorithms. The impact of these technologies on patients' well-being and daily lives has not yet been investigated. Methods: We conducted 10 qualitative interviews with patients who used the GUIDE-IBD mHealth technology. This is a special smartphone app for patients to record patient-reported outcomes and a wearable to track physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. For data analysis, we used interpretative phenomenological analysis. This method is ideally suited for studying people's lived experiences. Results: The analysis of the data revealed 11 themes that were mentioned by at least 3 participants. These themes were: Self-Tracking with wearable devices as normality; variable value of the data from the wearable; risk of putting people under pressure; stimulus to reflect on their own well-being and illness; risk of psychological distress; discussion about app data in the medical consultation is very brief or nonexistent; easier to be honest with an app than with a doctor; questionnaires do not always adequately capture the patient's condition; need for support; the possibility to look at the data retrospectively; and annoyed by additional tasks.

"Explainable machine-learning algorithms to differentiate bipolar disorder from major depressive disorder using self-reported symptoms, vital signs, and blood-based markers",Zhu T.,2023,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,"Background and objective: Caused by shared genetic risk factors and similar neuropsychological symptoms, bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are at high risk of misdiagnosis, which is associated with ineffective treatment and worsening of outcomes. We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML)-based diagnostic system, based on electronic medical records (EMR) data, to mimic the clinical reasoning of human physicians to differentiate MDD and BD (especially BD depressive episodes) patients about to be admitted to a hospital and, hence, reduce the misdiagnosis of BD as MDD on admission. In addition, we examined to what extent our ML model could be made interpretable by quantifying and visualizing the features that drive the predictions. Methods: By identifying 16,311 patients admitted to a hospital located in western China between 2009 and 2018 with a recorded main diagnosis of MDD or BD, we established three sub-cohorts with different combinations of features for both the MDD-BD cohort and the MDD-BD depressive episodes cohort, respectively. Four different ML algorithms (logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, and support vector machine) and four train-test splits were used to train and validate diagnostic models, and explainable methods (SHAP and Break Down) were utilized to analyze the contribution of each of the features at both population-level and individual-level, including feature importance, feature interaction, and feature effect on prediction decision for a specific subject. Results: The XGBoost algorithm provided the best test performance (AUC: 0.838 (0.810–0.867), PPV: 0.810 and NPV: 0.834) for separating patients with BD from those with MDD. Core predictors included symptoms (mood-up, exciting, bad sleep, loss of interest, talking, mood-down, provoke), along with age, job, myocardial enzyme markers (creatine kinase, hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), diabetes-associated marker (glucose), bone function marker (alkaline phosphatase), non-enzymatic antioxidant (uric acid), markers of immune/inflammation (white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, basophil percentage, monocyte count), cardiovascular function marker (low density lipoprotein), renal marker (total protein), liver biochemistry marker (indirect bilirubin), and vital signs like pulse. For separating patients with BD depressive episodes from those with MDD, the test AUC was 0.777 (0.732–0.822), with PPV 0.576 and NPV 0.899. Additional validation in models built with self-reported symptoms removed from the feature set, showed test AUC of 0.701 (0.666–0.736) for differentiating BD and MDD, and AUC of 0.564 (0.515–0.614) for detecting patients in BD depressive episodes from MDD patients. Validation in the datasets without removing the patients with comorbidity showed an AUC of 0.826 (0.806–0.846). Conclusion: The diagnostic system accurately identified patients with BD in various clinical scenarios, and differences in patterns of peripheral markers between BD and MDD could enrich our understanding of potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of them.",10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107723,18,Scopus,85166014366,2-s2.0-85166014366,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166014366
Time in nature is associated with higher levels of positive mood: Evidence from the 2023 NatureDose™ student survey,Bardhan M.,2023,Journal of Environmental Psychology,"Growing evidence shows that exposure to nature can improve mood. However, this evidence is mostly based on short-term or subjectively reported exposures. Machine learning and GPS mobile device tracking offer fine-grained assessments of minute-by-minute nature exposure over long periods. Few studies on nature exposure and mood have leveraged these technologies. We conducted one of the first longer-term investigations of daily nature exposure and mood with a mobile app as part of the NatureDose™ Student Study (NDSS). The NatureDose™ app uses GPS and a phone's sensors to evaluate whether a person is inside or outside and checks levels of nature surrounding the person with the NatureScore™ measure. This measure is based on more than 30 remotely sensed datasets, geo-located health records, and machine learning models. College students' nature exposure (N = 154 initial recruitment) was monitored for eight weeks (March 7 to May 1, 2022). Their mood states were calculated weekly using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Both exposure and outcome measures were continuous values. After three weeks, randomly selected groups of students were asked to either maintain or increase their nature exposures. However, students asked to increase their nature exposures maintained them. Therefore, evaluating cause-and-effect relationships through an experimental design was not possible. Instead, we evaluated observational associations between average nature exposure and mood levels across the study period using mixed-effect linear regression models adjusting for gender and allergies. Among the 97 participants with available data, we observed a positive association between nature exposure and positive mood (β = 0.10 [0.04–0.17], p = .003) but not negative mood (β = 0.01 [-0.07-0.09], p = .76). These findings were supported by sensitivity analyses with ANOVA models between tertiles on average NatureDose™ levels. We also found that the average nature exposure was 71 min per day, most of which (66%) was earned within 10 km of the center of the university campus. The study supports the utility of using NatureDose™ as an app-based tracking tool for objective nature exposure measurement. The study also reinforces previous findings on the associations between nature exposure and positive mood states. Greening university campuses and surrounding locations where college students live and spend leisure time could support college students' mental health.",10.1016/j.jenvp.2023.102083,14,Scopus,85165549270,2-s2.0-85165549270,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165549270
Astudy to analyze anxiety disorder of a group of engineering students during the second wave of COVID-19,Hore S.,2023,Minerva Psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: The second wave of COVID-19 has profoundly affected every sector of Indian, especially the student community. Hence, this study started with two objectives. The first is to analyze the anxiety level, among the students of an engineering college in India, during this pandemic. The second objective is to find an accurate prediction model to apprehend the level of anxiety beforehand. It will enable us to cater to timely crisis-oriented psychological services and take precautionary actions to reduce the anxiety level of this community in future crisis periods. METHODS: To assess the psychological state of the students, the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) has been employed. An online survey has been conducted in the month of April-May 2021 where 756 students of the Hooghly Engineering and Technology College (HETC) of West Bengal, India, had participated. To build an accurate predictive model through comparative analysis, four well-known machine-learning algorithms have been employed. RESULTS: The study shows that 11.24% of participants have severe anxiety levels, 13.49% of participants have moderate, 24.73% have mild and 50.52 participants have no anxiety at all. It also shows the students of 4th years have higher scores of anxiety (OR=1.22, 95%, CI=0.89-1.65) and 1st-year students having lower scores in all measures compared to their senior, while the Female students having more psychological impact, compared to Male students. The proposed predictive model has achieved 99% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the presence of a higher degree of anxiety among students compared to previous studies conducted by other researchers during the first wave as mentioned in the survey.",10.23736/S2724-6612.22.02297-7,0,Scopus,85173432540,2-s2.0-85173432540,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173432540
A Machine-Learning Approach to Assess Factors Associated With Hospitalization of Children and Youths in Psychiatric Crisis,Chen Y.L.,2023,Psychiatric Services Washington D C,"OBJECTIVE: The authors used a machine-learning approach to model clinician decision making regarding psychiatric hospitalization of children and youths in crisis and to identify factors associated with the decision to hospitalize. METHODS: Data consisted of 4,786 mobile crisis response team assessments of children and youths, ages 4.0-19.5 years (mean±SD=14.0±2.7 years, 56% female), in Nevada. The sample assessments were split into training and testing data sets. A random-forest machine-learning algorithm was used to identify variables related to the decision to hospitalize a child or youth after the crisis assessment. Results from the training sample were externally validated in the testing sample. RESULTS: The random-forest model had good performance (area under the curve training sample=0.91, testing sample=0.92). Variables found to be important in the decision to hospitalize a child or youth were acute suicidality, followed by poor judgment or decision making, danger to others, impulsivity, runaway behavior, other risky behaviors, nonsuicidal self-injury, psychotic or depressive symptoms, sleep problems, oppositional behavior, poor functioning at home or with peers, depressive or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and age. CONCLUSIONS: In crisis settings, clinicians were found to mostly focus on acute factors that increased risk for danger to self or others (e.g., suicidality, poor judgment), current psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychotic symptoms), and functioning (e.g., poor home functioning, problems with peer relationships) when deciding whether to hospitalize or stabilize a child or youth. To reduce psychiatric hospitalization, community-based services should target interventions to address these important factors associated with the need for a higher level of care among youths in psychiatric crisis.",10.1176/appi.ps.20220201,4,Scopus,85169505011,2-s2.0-85169505011,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169505011
Child and adolescent mental health and psychosocial support interventions: An evidence and gap map of low- and middle-income countries,Yu R.,2023,Campbell Systematic Reviews,"Background: Mental disorders affect about one in seven children and adolescents worldwide. Investment in effective child and adolescent mental health prevention, promotion and care is essential. To date, however, the evidence from this field is yet to be comprehensively collected and mapped. Objectives: The objective of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to provide an overview of the existing evidence on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at promoting mental health and reducing or preventing mental health conditions among children and adolescents in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Search Methods: We searched for studies from a wide range of bibliographic databases, libraries and websites. All searches were conducted in December 2021 and covered the period between 2010 and 2021. Selection Criteria: We included evidence on the effectiveness of any Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) interventions targeting children and adolescents from 0 to 19 years of age in LMICs. The map includes systematic reviews and effectiveness studies in the form of randomised control trials and quasi-experimental studies, and mixed-methods studies with a focus on intervention effectiveness. Data Collection and Analysis: A total of 63,947 records were identified after the search. A total of 19,578 records were removed using machine learning. A total of 7545 records were screened independently and simultaneously by four reviewers based on title and abstract and 2721 full texts were assessed for eligibility. The EGM includes 697 studies and reviews that covered 78 LMICs. Main Results: School-based interventions make up 61% of intervention research on child and adolescent mental health and psychosocial support. Most interventions (59%) focusing on treating mental health conditions rather than preventing them or promoting mental health. Depression (40%, N = 282) was the most frequently researched outcome sub-domain analysed by studies and reviews, followed by anxiety disorders (32%, N = 225), well-being (21%, N = 143), and post-traumatic stress disorder (18%, N = 125). Most included studies and reviews investigated the effectiveness of mental health and psychosocial support interventions in early (75%, N = 525) and late adolescence (64%, N = 448). Conclusions: The body of evidence in this area is complex and it is expanding progressively. However, research on child and adolescent MHPSS interventions is more reactive than proactive, with most evidence focusing on addressing mental health conditions that have already arisen rather than preventing them or promoting mental health. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions for children and adolescents as well as interventions to address the mental health and psychosocial needs of children in humanitarian settings. Research on early childhood MHPSS interventions is urgently needed. MHPSS research for children and adolescents lacks diversity. Research is also needed to address geographical inequalities at the regional and national level. Important questions also remain on the quality of the available research—is child and adolescent MHPSS intervention research locally relevant, reliable, well-designed and conducted, accessible and innovative? Planning research collaborations with decision-makers and involving experts by experience in research is essential.",10.1002/cl2.1349,17,Scopus,85168563398,2-s2.0-85168563398,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168563398
Digital Therapeutics as a New Therapeutic Modality: A Review from the Perspective of Clinical Pharmacology,Ribba B.,2023,Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,"The promise of transforming digital technologies into treatments is what drives the development of digital therapeutics (DTx), generally known as software applications embedded within accessible technologies—such as smartphones—to treat, manage, or prevent a pathological condition. Whereas DTx solutions that successfully demonstrate effectiveness and safety could drastically improve the life of patients in multiple therapeutic areas, there is a general consensus that generating therapeutic evidence for DTx presents challenges and open questions. We believe there are three main areas where the application of clinical pharmacology principles from the drug development field could benefit DTx development: the characterization of the mechanism of action, the optimization of the intervention, and, finally, its dosing. We reviewed DTx studies to explore how the field is approaching these topics and to better characterize the challenges associated with them. This leads us to emphasize the role that the application of clinical pharmacology principles could play in the development of DTx and to advocate for a development approach that merges such principles from development of traditional therapeutics with important considerations from the highly attractive and fast-paced world of digital solutions.",10.1002/cpt.2989,10,Scopus,85164370679,2-s2.0-85164370679,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164370679
Role of Sports Based on Big Data Analysis in Promoting the Physique and Health of Children and Adolescents,Wen P.,2023,Data Intelligence,"Healthy body is the foundation of young people’s growth. With the popularization and globalization of the Internet, multimedia technology is rapidly changing the impact of traditional media on the growth of young people. The current health situation of young people is not optimistic. The decline in physical fitness, obesity and psychological dysplasia of adolescents have aroused the concern of all sectors of society. In recent years, the emergence and dissemination of big data (BD) has brought a new dimension to the value of data applications. The combination of BD and youth health services provides young people with good health opportunities. Through the recording, analysis and release of adolescent physical health data, the system has established an extensive knowledge database on adolescent physical and mental health, thus improving the physical health of adolescents. This paper summarized and combed the overview and application of BD, and analyzed and discussed the reasons for the continuous decline of young people’s physique. Through the analysis of the application of BD in the promotion of young people’s physical health, this paper proposed more achievable improvement strategies and plans, and then summarizes and discusses the experiment. According to the survey and experiment, the random simulation algorithm was introduced into daily exercise, diet and life preference. The new system and health improvement strategy designed for teenagers’ physical health using BD could help students improve their physical health by 55%.",10.1162/dint_a_00207,2,Scopus,85180617578,2-s2.0-85180617578,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180617578
The Depressed Teenage Brain: Chatbot Psychoeducation,Dysthe K.K.,2023,Mayo Clinic Proceedings Digital Health,"Objective: To gain the knowledge needed to develop a cognitive behavioral intervention and reliable psychoeducation applicable for conversational artificial intelligence models, we investigated the underlying constructs of thoughts common to cognitive distortions found in online questions written by adolescents with symptoms of depression. Methods: From June 30, 2020, to October 30, 2020, we analyzed a sample of 100 written questions from adolescents about depression posted on an online information service using a qualitative analysis guided by cognitive behavioral theory and informed by the neuroscience of adolescence. Results: Four types of cognitive distortions (CDs) were found: (1) emotional reasoning, (2) mind reading, (3) catastrophizing, and (4) labeling. Our analysis suggested 3 underlying constructs common to the different CDs: (1) emotional states appearing as reality, (2) experiencing this emotional reality as something others think, and (3) generalizing such beliefs to every relation and the future. These constructs may signify events leading to a ruminative state that seems hard to escape. Conclusion: The 4 different CDs originate from 3 underlying constructs possibly associated with adolescent neurodevelopment. This study indicates a potential to reveal the underlying constructs of thought common to different CDs, thus making CDs more useful as a target point in artificial intelligence–based technological information and intervention tools.",10.1016/j.mcpdig.2023.03.008,2,Scopus,85206153674,2-s2.0-85206153674,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206153674
Predicting states of elevated negative affect in adolescents from smartphone sensors: a novel personalized machine learning approach,Ren B.,2023,Psychological Medicine,"Background Adolescence is characterized by profound change, including increases in negative emotions. Approximately 84% of American adolescents own a smartphone, which can continuously and unobtrusively track variables potentially predictive of heightened negative emotions (e.g. activity levels, location, pattern of phone usage). The extent to which built-in smartphone sensors can reliably predict states of elevated negative affect in adolescents is an open question. Methods Adolescent participants (n = 22; ages 13-18) with low to high levels of depressive symptoms were followed for 15 weeks using a combination of ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and continuously collected passive smartphone sensor data. EMAs probed negative emotional states (i.e. anger, sadness and anxiety) 2-3 times per day every other week throughout the study (total: 1145 EMA measurements). Smartphone accelerometer, location and device state data were collected to derive 14 discrete estimates of behavior, including activity level, percentage of time spent at home, sleep onset and duration, and phone usage. Results A personalized ensemble machine learning model derived from smartphone sensor data outperformed other statistical approaches (e.g. linear mixed model) and predicted states of elevated anger and anxiety with acceptable discrimination ability (area under the curve (AUC) = 74% and 71%, respectively), but demonstrated more modest discrimination ability for predicting states of high sadness (AUC = 66%). Conclusions To the extent that smartphone data could provide reasonably accurate real-time predictions of states of high negative affect in teens, brief 'just-in-time' interventions could be immediately deployed via smartphone notifications or mental health apps to alleviate these states.",10.1017/S0033291722002161,28,Scopus,85169290754,2-s2.0-85169290754,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169290754
"A scoping review of social media in child, adolescents and young adults: research findings in depression, anxiety and other clinical challenges",Hilty D.M.,2023,Bjpsych Open,"Background: Social media and other technologies are reshaping communication and health. Aims: This review addresses the relationship between social media use, behavioural health conditions and psychological well-being for youth aged <25 years. Method: A scoping review of 11 literature databases from 2000 to 2020 explored research studies in youth in five areas: clinical depression and anxiety, quantitative use, social media mode, engagement and qualitative dimensions and health and well-being. Results: Out of 2820 potential literature references, 140 met the inclusion criteria. The foci were clinical depression and anxiety disorders (n = 78), clinical challenges (e.g. suicidal ideation, cyberbullying) (n = 34) and psychological well-being (n = 28). Most studies focused on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Few studies are longitudinal in design (n = 26), had comparison groups (n = 27), were randomised controlled trials (n = 3) or used structured assessments (n = 4). Few focused on different youth and sociodemographic populations, particularly for low-income, equity-seeking and deserving populations. Studies examined association (n = 120; 85.7%), mediating (n = 16; 11.4%) and causal (n = 4; 2.9%) relationships. Prospective, longitudinal studies of depression and anxiety appear to indicate that shorter use (≤3 h/day) and purposeful engagement is associated with better mood and psychological well-being. Depression may predict social media use and reduce perception of support. Findings provide families, teachers and providers ways to engage youth. Conclusions: Research opportunities include clinical outcomes from functional perspective on a health continuum, diverse youth and sociodemographic populations, methodology, intervention and privacy issues. More longitudinal studies, comparison designs and effectiveness approaches are also needed.

Characterising symptom clusters in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing catheter ablation,Hobensack M.,2023,Open Heart,"Objective This study aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning clustering analyses to (1) identify co-occurring symptoms of patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) and (2) describe clinical and sociodemographic correlates of symptom clusters. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective analysis using electronic health records data. Adults who underwent AF ablation between 2010 and 2020 were included. Demographic, comorbidity and medication information was extracted using structured queries. Ten AF symptoms were extracted from unstructured clinical notes (n=13 416) using a validated NLP pipeline (F-score=0.81). We used the unsupervised machine learning approach known as Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering to characterise and identify subgroups of patients representing different clusters. Fisher's exact tests were used to investigate subgroup differences based on age, gender, race and heart failure (HF) status. Results A total of 1293 patients were included in our analysis (mean age 65.5 years, 35.2% female, 58% white). The most frequently documented symptoms were dyspnoea (64%), oedema (62%) and palpitations (57%). We identified six symptom clusters: generally symptomatic, dyspnoea and oedema, chest pain, anxiety, fatigue and palpitations, and asymptomatic (reference). The asymptomatic cluster had a significantly higher prevalence of male, white and comorbid HF patients. Conclusions We applied NLP and machine learning to a large dataset to identify symptom clusters, which may signify latent biological underpinnings of symptom experiences and generate implications for clinical care. AF patients' symptom experiences vary widely. Given prior work showing that AF symptoms predict adverse outcomes, future work should investigate associations between symptom clusters and postablation outcomes.",10.1136/openhrt-2023-002385,3,Scopus,85168503829,2-s2.0-85168503829,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168503829
A Precision Treatment Model for Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety and Depression among University Students: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial,Benjet C.,2023,JAMA Psychiatry,"Importance: Guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (i-CBT) is a low-cost way to address high unmet need for anxiety and depression treatment. Scalability could be increased if some patients were helped as much by self-guided i-CBT as guided i-CBT. Objective: To develop an individualized treatment rule using machine learning methods for guided i-CBT vs self-guided i-CBT based on a rich set of baseline predictors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prespecified secondary analysis of an assessor-blinded, multisite randomized clinical trial of guided i-CBT, self-guided i-CBT, and treatment as usual included students in Colombia and Mexico who were seeking treatment for anxiety (defined as a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7] score of ≥10) and/or depression (defined as a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score of ≥10). Study recruitment was from March 1 to October 26, 2021. Initial data analysis was conducted from May 23 to October 26, 2022. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a culturally adapted transdiagnostic i-CBT that was guided (n = 445), self-guided (n = 439), or treatment as usual (n = 435). Main Outcomes and Measures: Remission of anxiety (GAD-7 scores of ≤4) and depression (PHQ-9 scores of ≤4) 3 months after baseline. Results: The study included 1319 participants (mean [SD] age, 21.4 [3.2] years; 1038 women [78.7%]; 725 participants [55.0%] came from Mexico). A total of 1210 participants (91.7%) had significantly higher mean (SE) probabilities of joint remission of anxiety and depression with guided i-CBT (51.8% [3.0%]) than with self-guided i-CBT (37.8% [3.0%]; P =.003) or treatment as usual (40.0% [2.7%]; P =.001). The remaining 109 participants (8.3%) had low mean (SE) probabilities of joint remission of anxiety and depression across all groups (guided i-CBT: 24.5% [9.1%]; P =.007; self-guided i-CBT: 25.4% [8.8%]; P =.004; treatment as usual: 31.0% [9.4%]; P =.001). All participants with baseline anxiety had nonsignificantly higher mean (SE) probabilities of anxiety remission with guided i-CBT (62.7% [5.9%]) than the other 2 groups (self-guided i-CBT: 50.2% [6.2%]; P =.14; treatment as usual: 53.0% [6.0%]; P =.25). A total of 841 of 1177 participants (71.5%) with baseline depression had significantly higher mean (SE) probabilities of depression remission with guided i-CBT (61.5% [3.6%]) than the other 2 groups (self-guided i-CBT: 44.3% [3.7%]; P =.001; treatment as usual: 41.8% [3.2%]; P <.001). The other 336 participants (28.5%) with baseline depression had nonsignificantly higher mean (SE) probabilities of depression remission with self-guided i-CBT (54.4% [6.0%]) than guided i-CBT (39.8% [5.4%]; P =.07). Conclusions and Relevance: Guided i-CBT yielded the highest probabilities of remission of anxiety and depression for most participants; however, these differences were nonsignificant for anxiety. Some participants had the highest probabilities of remission of depression with self-guided i-CBT. Information about this variation could be used to optimize allocation of guided and self-guided i-CBT in resource-constrained settings.

Positive Prospective Mental Imagery Characteristics in Young Adults and Their Associations with Depressive Symptoms,Marciniak M.A.,2023,Cognitive Therapy and Research,"Background: Positive prospective mental imagery plays an important role in mental well-being, and depressive symptoms have been associated with difficulties in generating positive prospective mental images (PPMIs). We used a mobile app to gather PPMIs generated by young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzed content, characteristics, and associations with depressive symptoms. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial with 95 healthy young adults allocated into two groups (intervention and control). Participants used the mobile app decreasing mental health symptoms for seven consecutive days. Fifty participants in the intervention group reported PPMIs at least three times per day using a mobile app inducing PPMI generation. We categorized entries into themes and applied moderation models to investigate associations between PPMI characteristics and depressive symptoms. Results: We distinguished 25 PPMI themes. The most frequent were related to consuming food and drinks, watching TV/streaming platforms, and doing sports. Vividness and ease of generation of PPMIs, but not their anticipation, pleasure intensity or number of engagements with the app were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Conclusions: We identified PPMI themes in young adults and found significant negative associations between depressive symptoms and vividness and generation ease of PPMIs. These results may inform prevention and intervention science, including the design of personalized interventions. We discuss implications for future studies and treatment development for individuals experiencing diminished PPMI.",10.1007/s10608-023-10378-5,4,Scopus,85153742451,2-s2.0-85153742451,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153742451
Application of image super-resolution recognition and artificial intelligence system in repairing students' psychological education problems,Li S.,2023,Preventive Medicine,"With the continuous development of society, people's life pressure is constantly increasing, and the mental health problems of college students are becoming increasingly prominent, bringing many challenges to their education and management. Universities should not only cultivate students' theoretical and professional knowledge and practical skills, but also attach importance to their mental health and effectively implement psychological education. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop and design a simple and effective student psychological evaluation system. As a new form of ideological and political transformation in universities in the era of big data, online ideological and political work has potential development space. It is necessary to carry out mental health education in universities, fully utilize online education forms, and improve ability of universities to repair mental health problems. Based on this, this system designs and implements software for typical image resolution based recognition and artificial intelligence. The use of B/S architecture in the development and use of. net technology and web server technology will enable more students to connect and use different terminals. In addition, an algorithm for image super-resolution recognition was proposed, which uses clustering convolution to improve residual blocks, improves modeling ability by extracting features on a larger scale, reduces the number of parameters to improve model calculation efficiency, and enables mental health educators and managers to work better. This article combines image super-resolution recognition technology with artificial intelligence technology to apply it to the process of psychological education in universities, thereby promoting the development of problem repair applications.",10.1016/j.ypmed.2023.107590,8,Scopus,85163175210,2-s2.0-85163175210,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163175210
Risk factors for late preterm and term stillbirth: A secondary analysis of an individual participant data meta-analysis,Thompson R.A.,2023,BJOG an International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,"Objective: Identify independent and novel risk factors for late-preterm (28–36 weeks) and term (≥37 weeks) stillbirth and explore development of a risk-prediction model. Design: Secondary analysis of an Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analysis investigating modifiable stillbirth risk factors. Setting: An IPD database from five case–control studies in New Zealand, Australia, the UK and an international online study. Population: Women with late-stillbirth (cases, n = 851), and ongoing singleton pregnancies from 28 weeks’ gestation (controls, n = 2257). Methods: Established and novel risk factors for late-preterm and term stillbirth underwent univariable and multivariable logistic regression modelling with multiple sensitivity analyses. Variables included maternal age, body mass index (BMI), parity, mental health, cigarette smoking, second-hand smoking, antenatal-care utilisation, and detailed fetal movement and sleep variables. Main outcome measures: Independent risk factors with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for late-preterm and term stillbirth. Results: After model building, 575 late-stillbirth cases and 1541 controls from three contributing case–control studies were included. Risk factor estimates from separate multivariable models of late-preterm and term stillbirth were compared. As these were similar, the final model combined all late-stillbirths. The single multivariable model confirmed established demographic risk factors, but additionally showed that fetal movement changes had both increased (decreased frequency) and reduced (hiccoughs, increasing strength, frequency or vigorous fetal movements) aOR of stillbirth. Poor antenatal-care utilisation increased risk while more-than-adequate care was protective. The area-under-the-curve was 0.84 (95% CI 0.82–0.86). Conclusions: Similarities in risk factors for late-preterm and term stillbirth suggest the same approach for risk-assessment can be applied. Detailed fetal movement assessment and inclusion of antenatal-care utilisation could be valuable in late-stillbirth risk assessment.",10.1111/1471-0528.17444,6,Scopus,85150924573,2-s2.0-85150924573,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150924573
Feasibility and impact of a mental health chatbot on postpartum mental health: a randomized controlled trial,Suharwardy S.,2023,Ajog Global Reports,"BACKGROUND: Perinatal mood disorders are common yet underdiagnosed and un- or undertreated. Barriers exist to accessing perinatal mental health services, including limited availability, time, and cost. Automated conversational agents (chatbots) can deliver evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy content through text message-based conversations and reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in select populations. Such digital mental health technologies are poised to overcome barriers to mental health care access but need to be evaluated for efficacy, as well as for preliminary feasibility and acceptability among perinatal populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a mental health chatbot for mood management in a general postpartum population. STUDY DESIGN: An unblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary academic center. English-speaking postpartum women aged 18 years or above with a live birth and access to a smartphone were eligible for enrollment prior to discharge from delivery hospitalization. Baseline surveys were administered to all participants prior to randomization to a mental health chatbot intervention or to usual care only. The intervention group downloaded the mental health chatbot smartphone application with perinatal-specific content, in addition to continuing usual care. Usual care consisted of routine postpartum follow up and mental health care as dictated by the patient's obstetric provider. Surveys were administered during delivery hospitalization (baseline) and at 2-, 4-, and 6-weeks postpartum to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. The primary outcome was a change in depression symptoms at 6-weeks as measured using two depression screening tools: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms measured using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and satisfaction and acceptability using validated scales. Based on a prior study, we estimated a sample size of 130 would have sufficient (80%) power to detect a moderate effect size (d=.4) in between group difference on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: A total of 192 women were randomized equally 1:1 to the chatbot or usual care; of these, 152 women completed the 6-week survey (n=68 chatbot, n=84 usual care) and were included in the final analysis. Mean baseline mental health assessment scores were below positive screening thresholds. At 6-weeks, there was a greater decrease in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores among the chatbot group compared to the usual care group (mean decrease=1.32, standard deviation=3.4 vs mean decrease=0.13, standard deviation=3.01, respectively). 6-week mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scores did not differ between groups and were similar to baseline. 91% (n=62) of the chatbot users were satisfied or highly satisfied with the chatbot, and 74% (n=50) of the intervention group reported use of the chatbot at least once in 2 weeks prior to the 6-week survey. 80% of study participants reported being comfortable with the use of a mobile smartphone application for mood management. CONCLUSION: Use of a chatbot was acceptable to women in the early postpartum period. The sample did not screen positive for depression at baseline and thus the potential of the chatbot to reduce depressive symptoms in this population was limited. This study was conducted in a general obstetric population. Future studies of longer duration in high-risk postpartum populations who screen positive for depression are needed to further understand the utility and efficacy of such digital therapeutics for that population.",10.1016/j.xagr.2023.100165,41,Scopus,85148771428,2-s2.0-85148771428,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148771428
A multisite comparison using electronic health records and natural language processing to identify the association between suicidality and hospital readmission amongst patients with eating disorders,Cliffe C.,2023,International Journal of Eating Disorders,"Objectives: To describe and compare the association between suicidality and subsequent readmission for patients hospitalized for eating disorder treatment, within 2 years of discharge, at two large academic medical centers in two different countries. Methods: Over an 8-year study window from January 2009 to March 2017, we identified all inpatient eating disorder admissions at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, USA (WCM) and South London and Maudsley Foundation NHS Trust, London, UK (SLaM). To establish each patient's—suicidality profile, we applied two natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, independently developed at the two institutions, and detected suicidality in clinical notes documented in the first week of admission. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) for any subsequent readmission within 2 years postdischarge and determined whether this was to another eating disorder unit, other psychiatric unit, a general medical hospital admission or emergency room attendance. Results: We identified 1126 and 420 eating disorder inpatient admissions at WCM and SLaM, respectively. In the WCM cohort, evidence of above average suicidality during the first week of admission was significantly associated with an increased risk of noneating disorder-related psychiatric readmission (OR 3.48 95% CI = 2.03–5.99, p-value <.001), but a similar pattern was not observed in the SLaM cohort (OR 1.34, 95% CI = 0.75–2.37, p =.32), there was no significant increase in risk of admission. In both cohorts, personality disorder increased the risk of any psychiatric readmission within 2 years. Discussion: Patterns of increased risk of psychiatric readmission from above average suicidality detected via NLP during inpatient eating disorder admissions differed in our two patient cohorts. However, comorbid diagnoses such as personality disorder increased the risk of any psychiatric readmission across both cohorts. Public Significance: Suicidality amongst is eating disorders is an extremely common presentation and it is important we further our understanding of identifying those most at risk. This research also provides a novel study design, comparing two NLP algorithms on electronic health record data based in the United States and United Kingdom on eating disorder inpatients. Studies researching both UK and US mental health patients are sparse therefore this study provides novel data.",10.1002/eat.23980,6,Scopus,85159412980,2-s2.0-85159412980,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159412980
Building an ecological momentary assessment smartphone app for 4- to 10-year-old children: A pilot study,Milojevich H.M.,2023,Plos One,"Objective Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) minimizes recall burden and maximizes ecological validity and has emerged as a valuable tool to characterize individual differences, assess contextual associations, and document temporal associations. However, EMA has yet to be reliably utilized in young children, in part due to concerns about responder reliability and limited compliance. The present study addressed these concerns by building a developmentally appropriate EMA smartphone app and testing the app for feasibility and usability with young children ages 4-10 (N = 20; m age = 7.7, SD = 2.0). Methods To pilot test the app, children completed an 11-item survey about their mood and behavior twice a day for 14 days. Parents also completed brief surveys twice a day to allow for parent- child comparisons of responses. Finally, at the end of the two weeks, parents provided user feedback on the smartphone app. Results Results indicated a high response rate (nearly 90%) across child surveys and high agreement between parents and children ranging from 0.89-0.97. Conclusions Overall, findings suggest that this developmentally appropriate EMA smartphone app is a reliable and valid tool for collecting in-the-moment data from young children outside of a laboratory setting.",10.1371/journal.pone.0290148,2,Scopus,85169230077,2-s2.0-85169230077,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169230077
“Making Data the Drug”: A Pragmatic Pilot Feasibility Randomized Crossover Trial of Data Visualization as an Intervention for Pediatric Chronic Pain,Boerner K.E.,2023,Children,"Data tracking is a common feature of pain e-health applications, however, viewing visualizations of this data has not been investigated for its potential as an intervention itself. We conducted a pilot feasibility parallel randomized cross-over trial, 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants were youth age 12–18 years recruited from a tertiary-level pediatric chronic pain clinic in Western Canada. Participants completed two weeks of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data collection, one of which also included access to a data visualization platform to view their results. Order of weeks was randomized, participants were not masked to group assignment. Objectives were to establish feasibility related to recruitment, retention, and participant experience. Of 146 youth approached, 48 were eligible and consented to participation, two actively withdrew prior to the EMA. Most participants reported satisfaction with the process and provided feedback on additional variables of interest. Technical issues with the data collection platform impacted participant experience and data analysis, and only 48% viewed the visualizations. Four youth reported adverse events not related to visualizations.

MTTM: Metamorphic Testing for Textual Content Moderation Software,Wang W.,2023,Proceedings International Conference on Software Engineering,"The exponential growth of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook has revolutionized textual communication and textual content publication in human society. However, they have been increasingly exploited to propagate toxic content, such as hate speech, malicious advertisement, and pornography, which can lead to highly negative impacts (e.g., harmful effects on teen mental health). Researchers and practitioners have been enthusiastically developing and extensively deploying textual content moderation software to address this problem. However, we find that malicious users can evade moderation by changing only a few words in the toxic content. Moreover, modern content moderation software's performance against malicious inputs remains underexplored. To this end, we propose MTTM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Textual content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2, 000 text messages collected from real users and summarize eleven metamorphic relations across three perturbation levels: character, word, and sentence. MTTM employs these metamorphic relations on toxic textual contents to generate test cases, which are still toxic yet likely to evade moderation. In our evaluation, we employ MTTM to test three commercial textual content moderation software and two state-of-the-art moderation algorithms against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTTM achieves up to 83.9%, 51%, and 82.5% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Google, Baidu, and Huawei, respectively, and it obtains up to 91.2% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy. In addition, we leverage the test cases generated by MTTM to retrain the model we explored, which largely improves model robustness 0% 5.9% EFR) while maintaining the accuracy on the original test set.

Experience sampling methods for the personalised prediction of mental health problems in Spanish university students: protocol for a survey-based observational study within the PROMES-U project,Portillo-Van Diest A.,2023,BMJ Open,"Introduction There is a high prevalence of mental health problems among university students. Better prediction and treatment access for this population is needed. In recent years, short-term dynamic factors, which can be assessed using experience sampling methods (ESM), have presented promising results for predicting mental health problems. Methods and analysis Undergraduate students from five public universities in Spain are recruited to participate in two web-based surveys (at baseline and at 12-month follow-up). A subgroup of baseline participants is recruited through quota sampling to participate in a 15-day ESM study. The baseline survey collects information regarding distal risk factors, while the ESM study collects short-term dynamic factors such as affect, company or environment. Risk factors will be identified at an individual and population level using logistic regressions and population attributable risk proportions, respectively. Machine learning techniques will be used to develop predictive models for mental health problems. Dynamic structural equation modelling and multilevel mixed-effects models will be considered to develop a series of explanatory models for the occurrence of mental health problems. Ethics and dissemination The project complies with national and international regulations, including the Declaration of Helsinki and the Code of Ethics, and has been approved by the IRB Parc de Salut Mar (2020/9198/I) and corresponding IRBs of all participating universities. All respondents are given information regarding access mental health services within their university and region. Individuals with positive responses on suicide items receive a specific alert with indications for consulting with a health professional. Participants are asked to provide informed consent separately for the web-based surveys and for the ESM study. Dissemination of results will include peer-reviewed scientific articles and participation in scientific congresses, reports with recommendations for universities' mental health policy makers, as well as a well-balanced communication strategy to the general public.

Machine learning approaches for predicting suicidal behaviors among university students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study,Mahmud S.,2023,Medicine United States,"Psychological and behavioral stress has increased enormously during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, early prediction and intervention to address psychological distress and suicidal behaviors are crucial to prevent suicide-related deaths. This study aimed to develop a machine algorithm to predict suicidal behaviors and identify essential predictors of suicidal behaviors among university students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous online survey was conducted among university students in Bangladesh from June 1 to June 30, 2022. A total of 2391 university students completed and submitted the questionnaires. Five different Machine Learning models (MLMs) were applied to develop a suitable algorithm for predicting suicidal behaviors among university students. In predicting suicidal behaviors, the most crucial background and demographic features were relationship status, friendly environment in the family, family income, family type, and sex. In addition, features related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified as job loss, economic loss, and loss of family/relatives due to COVID-19. Moreover, factors related to mental health include depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. The performance evaluation and comparison of the MLM showed that all models behaved consistently and were comparable in predicting suicidal risk. However, the Support Vector Machine was the best and most consistent performing model among all MLMs in terms of accuracy (79%), Kappa (0.59), receiver operating characteristic (0.89), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.81). Support Vector Machine is the best-performing model for predicting suicidal risks among university students in Bangladesh and can help in designing appropriate and timely suicide prevention interventions.",10.1097/MD.0000000000034285,13,Scopus,85164845530,2-s2.0-85164845530,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164845530
"Application of the Chatbot in University Education: A Bibliometric Analysis of Indexed Scientific Production in SCOPUS, 2013-2023",Chamorro-Atalaya O.,2023,International Journal of Learning Teaching and Educational Research,"Universities today are employing tools based on artificial intelligence to improve the educational service in general. The chatbot represents an online communicative interaction tool which contributes to solving daily queries required by students, teachers or graduates. However, there are few bibliometric review studies on the chatbot that show in which areas there is a greater concentration or lack of scientific production at the university level. The objective of this article is to explore and describe the research trends regarding the application of the chatbot in university education through the bibliometric analysis of publications indexed to Scopus. The research is of an exploratory-descriptive level, developed under a quantitative approach. The study covered the scientific production between the years 2013 and 2023, identifying 210 manuscripts. It was identified that there is a growing trend in scientific production, particularly in scientific articles and conference papers. The most cited article was published in 2018 and has 162 citations. Therefore, it is concluded that there is a greater concentration in the scientific production of manuscripts focused on improving the university educational service, applying significantly to the improvement of academic performance, administrative management and university wellbeing. However, there is a gap that needs to be reduced in terms of the lack of scientific studies in which the chatbot is used as a tool to identify the satisfaction of university students. In addition, there is a lack of research on the use of a regulatory framework that regulates the application of the chatbot at the university level.",10.26803/ijlter.22.7.15,19,Scopus,85167993661,2-s2.0-85167993661,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167993661
Development of transdiagnostic clinical risk prediction models for 12-month onset and course of eating disorders among adolescents in the community,Mitchison D.,2023,International Journal of Eating Disorders,"Objective: To develop and internally validate risk prediction models for adolescent onset and persistence of eating disorders. Methods: N = 963 Australian adolescents (11–19 years) in the EveryBODY Study cohort completed online surveys in 2018 and 2019. Models were built to predict 12-month risk of (1) onset, and (2) persistence of a DSM-5 eating disorder. Results: Onset Model. Of the n = 687 adolescents without an eating disorder at baseline, 16.9% were identified with an eating disorder after 12 months. The prediction model was based on evidence-based risk factors for eating disorder onset available within the dataset (sex, body mass index percentile, strict weight loss dieting, history of bullying, psychological distress, weight/shape concerns). This model showed fair discriminative performance (mean AUC =.75). The most important factors were psychological distress, weight and shape concerns, and female sex. Diagnostic Persistence Model. Of the n = 276 adolescents with an eating disorder at baseline, 74.6% were identified as continuing to meet criteria for an eating disorder after 12 months. The prediction model for diagnostic persistence was based on available evidence-based risk factors for eating disorder persistence (purging, distress, social impairment). This model showed poor discriminative performance (mean AUC =.65). The most important factors were psychological distress and self-induced vomiting for weight control. Discussion: We found preliminary evidence for the utility of a parsimonious model for 12-month onset of an eating disorder among adolescents in the community. Future research should include additional evidence-based risk factors and validate models beyond the original sample. Public Significance: This study demonstrated the feasibility of developing parsimonious and accurate models for the prediction of future onset of an eating disorder among adolescents.

Early biomarkers of neurodevelopmental disorders in preterm infants: Protocol for a longitudinal cohort study,Zhao Y.,2023,BMJ Open,"Introduction Preterm (PT) infants are at high likelihood for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which could considerably impair the individuals' functions throughout their whole life. The current cohort study aims to investigate adverse outcomes, especially NDDs, in PT children, and the related early aberrant brain developmental biomarkers. Methods and analysis This is a prospective cohort study in Beijing, China. We plan to recruit 400 PT infants born at <37 weeks of gestational age (GA), and 200 full-term (FT) controls during the neonatal period (40 weeks corrected GA), then follow them up until they reach 6 years of age. This cohort is designed to assess neuropsychological functions, brain development, related environmental risk factors and the incidence of NDDs by using the following measures: (1) social, emotional, cognitive and sensorimotor functions; (2) MRI, electroencephalogram and functional near-infrared spectroscopy; (3) social economic status, maternal mental health and DNA methylation; and (4) symptoms and diagnosis of NDDs. Main data analyses will include comparing the neurodevelopment outcomes and brain developmental trajectories between PT and FT children using linear or logistic regressions and mixed-effects models. Regression analyses and machine learning will be used to identify early biological predictors and environmental risk or protective factors for later NDDs outcomes. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the research ethics committee of Peking University Third Hospital (M2021087).

Examining a social-based system with personalized recommendations to promote mental health for college students,Kazi F.F.,2023,Smart Health,"College students experience a high amount of stress due to different factors such as life transitions, heavy coursework, and adjustment to an independent lifestyle. Dealing with stress may lead students to not prioritize their wellness. As a result, most students’ mental health declines which may affect their overall well-being. In this paper, we propose the FreeMind system which is a social application for students to interact with peers as well as receive support for mental health promotion. FreeMind system aims to focus on self-care and uses machine learning (ML) with expert knowledge to recommend different behavioral strategies to manage stress based on users’ activity preferences and reported well-being. To assess our system, we conducted a study with 21 college students to evaluate the systems’ usability and feasibility.

Analyzing Perceived Psychological and Social Stress of University Students: A Machine Learning Approach,Ratul I.J.,2023,Heliyon,"The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the psychological and social stress levels of university students due to physical illness, enhanced dependence on mobile devices and internet, a lack of social activities, and home confinement. Therefore, early stress detection is crucial for their successful academic performance and mental well-being. The advent of machine learning (ML)-based prediction models can have a crucial impact in predicting stress at its early stages and taking necessary steps for the well-being of individuals. This study aims to develop a reliable machine learning-based prediction model for perceived stress prediction and validate the model using real-world data collected through an online survey among 444 university students from different ethnicity. The machine learning models were built using supervised machine learning algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the chi-squared test were employed as feature reduction techniques. Moreover, Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were employed for hyperparameter optimization (HPO). According to the findings, around 11.26% of individuals were identified with high levels of social stress. In comparison, approximately 24.10% of people were found to be suffering from extremely high psychological stress, which is quite alarming for students' mental health. Furthermore, the prediction results of the ML models demonstrated the most remarkable accuracy (80.5%), precision (1.000), F1 score (0.890), and recall value (0.826). The Multilayer Perceptron model was shown to have the maximum accuracy when combined with PCA as a feature reduction approach and GSCV for HPO. The convenience sampling technique used in this study only considers self-reported data, which may have biased results and lack generalizability. Future research should consider a large sample of data and focus on tracking long-term impacts with coping strategies and interventions.

A Digital Coach to Promote Emotion Regulation Skills,Hopman K.,2023,Multimodal Technologies and Interaction,"There is growing awareness that effective emotion regulation is critical for health, adjustment and wellbeing. Emerging evidence suggests that interventions that promote flexible emotion regulation may have the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of mental health problems in specific at-risk populations. The challenge is how best to engage with at risk populations, who may not be actively seeking assistance, to deliver this early intervention approach. One possible solution is via digital technology and development, which has rapidly accelerated in this space. Such rapid growth has, however, occurred at the expense of developing a deep understanding of key elements of successful program design and specific mechanisms that influence health behavior change. This paper presents a detailed description of the design, development and evaluation of an emotion regulation intervention conversational agent (ERICA) who acts as a digital coach. ERICA uses interactive conversation to encourage self-reflection and to support and empower users to learn a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies including Refocusing, Reappraisal, Planning and Putting into Perspective. A pilot evaluation of ERICA was conducted with 138 university students and confirmed that ERICA provided a feasible and highly usable method for delivering an emotion regulation intervention. The results also indicated that ERICA was able to develop a therapeutic relationship with participants and increase their intent to use a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies. These findings suggest that ERICA holds potential to be an effective approach for delivering an early intervention to support mental health and wellbeing. ERICA’s dialogue, embedded with interactivity, therapeutic alliance and empathy cues, provide the basis for the development of other psychoeducation interventions.",10.3390/mti7060057,8,Scopus,85163768923,2-s2.0-85163768923,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163768923
Integrating digital interventions with clinical practice in youth mental health services,Cross S.P.,2023,Australasian Psychiatry,"Objective: Integrating digital technologies with clinical practice promises to improve access and enhance care in the context of high service demand and constrained capacity. Method: We outline the emerging research in the integration of digital tools in clinical care, known as blended care, and provide case examples of mental health technology platforms currently in use, summarise findings regarding novel technologies such as virtual reality, and outline real-world implementation challenges and potential solutions. Results: Recent evidence shows that blended care approaches are clinically effective and improve service efficiency. Youth-specific technologies such as moderated online social therapy (MOST) are achieving a range of positive clinical and functional outcomes, while emerging technologies like virtual reality have strong evidence in anxiety disorder, and accumulating evidence in psychotic conditions. Implementation science frameworks show promise in helping overcome the common challenges faced in real-world adoption and ongoing use. Conclusion: The integrated, blended use of digital mental health technologies with face-to-face clinical care has the potential to improve care quality for young people while helping overcome the growing challenges faced by youth mental health service providers.",10.1177/10398562231169365,9,Scopus,85154602665,2-s2.0-85154602665,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85154602665
Serious Games in the new era of digital-health interventions: A narrative review of their therapeutic applications to manage neurobehavior in neurodevelopmental disorders,Vacca R.A.,2023,Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews,"Children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders generally show adaptive, cognitive and motor skills impairments associated with behavioral problems, i.e., alterations in attention, anxiety and stress regulation, emotional and social relationships, which strongly limit their quality of life. This narrative review aims at providing a critical overview of the current knowledge in the field of serious games (SGs), known as digital instructional interactive videogames, applied to neurodevelopmental disorders. Indeed, a growing number of studies is drawing attention to SGs as innovative and promising interventions in managing neurobehavioral and cognitive disturbs in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Accordingly, we provide a literature overview of the current evidence regarding the actions and the effects of SGs. In addition, we describe neurobehavioral alterations occurring in some specific neurodevelopmental disorders for which a possible therapeutic use of SGs has been suggested. Finally, we discuss findings obtained in clinical trials using SGs as digital therapeutics in neurodevelopment disorders and suggest new directions and hypotheses for future studies to bridge the gaps between clinical research and clinical practice.",10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105156,30,Scopus,85152648451,2-s2.0-85152648451,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152648451
Child and adolescent anxiety as a risk factor for bipolar disorder: A systematic review of longitudinal studies,Buckley V.,2023,Bipolar Disorders,"Objectives: Several studies have suggested that anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence often precede the onset of bipolar disorder. We therefore systematically reviewed the relationship between child and adolescent anxiety and later bipolar disorder. Methods: Online databases (Medline [for Ovid], EMBASE and PsychINFO) were searched for original, peer-reviewed studies examining the relationship between child and adolescent anxiety and later bipolar disorder. Studies in both community samples and bipolar offspring samples were included. Results: A total of 16 studies were included in the review. The results were broadly consistent and revealed that child and adolescent anxiety disorders are associated with later bipolar disorder in community samples. In bipolar offspring, child and adolescent anxiety disorders are a marker of increased risk and predict the onset of bipolar disorder and other major mood disorders. Conclusions: There is evidence that anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence increase the risk of later bipolar disorder. Anxiety disorders may be a useful target for early intervention in those at high-risk of bipolar disorder.",10.1111/bdi.13322,10,Scopus,85151484362,2-s2.0-85151484362,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151484362
Investigating online activity in UK adolescent mental health patients: A feasibility study using a natural language processing approach for electronic health records,Sedgwick R.,2023,BMJ Open,"Objectives To assess the feasibility of using a natural language processing (NLP) application for extraction of free-text online activity mentions in adolescent mental health patient electronic health records (EHRs). Setting The Clinical Records Interactive Search system allows detailed research based on deidentified EHRs from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, a large south London Mental Health Trust providing secondary and tertiary mental healthcare. Participants and methods We developed a gazetteer of online activity terms and annotation guidelines, from 5480 clinical notes (200 adolescents, aged 11-17 years) receiving specialist mental healthcare. The preprocessing and manual curation steps of this real-world data set allowed development of a rule-based NLP application to automate identification of online activity (internet, social media, online gaming) mentions in EHRs. The context of each mention was also recorded manually as: supportive, detrimental or neutral in a subset of data for additional analysis. Results The NLP application performed with good precision (0.97) and recall (0.94) for identification of online activity mentions. Preliminary analyses found 34% of online activity mentions were considered to have been documented within a supportive context for the young person, 38% detrimental and 28% neutral. Conclusion Our results provide an important example of a rule-based NLP methodology to accurately identify online activity recording in EHRs, enabling researchers to now investigate associations with a range of adolescent mental health outcomes.",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061640,4,Scopus,85160455874,2-s2.0-85160455874,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160455874
Development and validation of a prediction nomogram for academic burnout among Chinese adolescents: a cross-sectional study,Ye S.,2023,BMJ Open,"Objectives This study aimed to screen the potential risk factors for academic burnout among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, develop and validate a predictive tool based on the risk factors for predicting academic burnout. Design This article presents a cross-sectional study. Setting This study surveyed two high schools in Anhui Province, China. Participants A total of 1472 adolescents were enrolled in this study. Outcome measures The questionnaires included demographic characteristic variables, living and learning states and adolescents' academic burnout scale. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to screen the risk factors for academic burnout and develop a predictive model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the accuracy and discrimination of the nomogram. Results In this study, 21.70% of adolescents reported academic burnout. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that single-child family (OR=1.742, 95% CI: 1.243 to 2.441, p=0.001), domestic violence (OR=1.694, 95% CI: 1.159 to 2.476, p=0.007), online entertainment (>8 hours/day, OR=3.058, 95% CI: 1.634 to 5.720, p<0.001), physical activity (<3 hours/week, OR=1.686, 95% CI: 1.032 to 2.754, p=0.037), sleep duration (<6 hours/night, OR=2.342, 95% CI: 1.315 to 4.170, p=0.004) and academic performance (<400 score, OR=2.180, 95% CI: 1.201 to 3.958, p=0.010) were independent significant risk factors associated with academic burnout. The area under the curve of ROC with the nomogram was 0.686 in the training set and 0.706 in the validation set. Furthermore, DCA demonstrated that the nomogram had good clinical utility for both sets.

Predicting Responses to Electroconvulsive Therapy in Adolescents with Treatment-Refractory Depression Based on Resting-State fMRI,Li X.,2023,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Objects: The efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the treatment of adolescents with treatment-refractory depression is still unsatisfactory, and the individual differences are large. It is not clear which factors are related to the treatment effect. Resting-state fMRI may be a good tool to predict the clinical efficacy of this treatment, and it is helpful to identify the most suitable population for this treatment. Methods: Forty treatment-refractory depression adolescents were treated by ECT and evaluated using HAMD and BSSI scores before and after treatment, and were then divided into a treatment response group and a non-treatment group according to the reduction rate of the HAMD scale. We extracted the ALFF, fALFF, ReHo, and functional connectivity of patients as predicted features after a two-sample t-test and LASSO to establish and evaluate a prediction model of ECT in adolescents with treatment-refractory depression. Results: Twenty-seven patients achieved a clinical response; symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation were significantly improved after treatment with ECT, which was reflected in a significant decrease in the scores of HAMD and BSSI (p < 0.001). The efficacy was predicted by ALFF, fALFF, ReHo, and whole-brain-based functional connectivity. We found that models built on a subset of features of ALFF in the left insula, fALFF in the left superior parietal gyrus, right superior parietal gyrus, and right angular, and functional connectivity between the left superior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral–right paracentral lobule, right middle frontal gyrus, orbital part–left cuneus, right olfactory cortex–left hippocampus, left insula–left thalamus, and left anterior cingulate gyrus–right hippocampus to have the best predictive performance (AUC > 0.8). Conclusions: The local brain function in the insula, superior parietal gyrus, and angular gyrus as well as characteristic changes in the functional connectivity of cortical–limbic circuits may serve as potential markers for efficacy judgment of ECT and help to provide optimized individual treatment strategies for adolescents with depression and suicidal ideation in the early stages of treatment.",10.3390/jcm12103556,9,Scopus,85160511849,2-s2.0-85160511849,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160511849
Protocol for a bandit-based response adaptive trial to evaluate the effectiveness of brief self-guided digital interventions for reducing psychological distress in university students: the Vibe Up study,Huckvale K.,2023,BMJ Open,"Introduction Meta-analytical evidence confirms a range of interventions, including mindfulness, physical activity and sleep hygiene, can reduce psychological distress in university students. However, it is unclear which intervention is most effective. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven adaptive trials may be an efficient method to determine what works best and for whom. The primary purpose of the study is to rank the effectiveness of mindfulness, physical activity, sleep hygiene and an active control on reducing distress, using a multiarm contextual bandit-based AI-adaptive trial method. Furthermore, the study will explore which interventions have the largest effect for students with different levels of baseline distress severity. Methods and analysis The Vibe Up study is a pragmatically oriented, decentralised AI-adaptive group sequential randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of one of three brief, 2-week digital self-guided interventions (mindfulness, physical activity or sleep hygiene) or active control (ecological momentary assessment) in reducing self-reported psychological distress in Australian university students. The adaptive trial methodology involves up to 12 sequential mini-trials that allow for the optimisation of allocation ratios. The primary outcome is change in psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, 21-item version, DASS-21 total score) from preintervention to postintervention. Secondary outcomes include change in physical activity, sleep quality and mindfulness from preintervention to postintervention. Planned contrasts will compare the four groups (ie, the three intervention and control) using self-reported psychological distress at prespecified time points for interim analyses. The study aims to determine the best performing intervention, as well as ranking of other interventions.

Getting Meta: A Multimodal Approach for Detecting Unsafe Conversations within Instagram Direct Messages of Youth,Ali S.,2023,Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction,"Instagram, one of the most popular social media platforms among youth, has recently come under scrutiny for potentially being harmful to the safety and well-being of our younger generations. Automated approaches for risk detection may be one way to help mitigate some of these risks if such algorithms are both accurate and contextual to the types of online harms youth face on social media platforms. However, the imminent switch by Instagram to end-to-end encryption for private conversations will limit the type of data that will be available to the platform to detect and mitigate such risks. In this paper, we investigate which indicators are most helpful in automatically detecting risk in Instagram private conversations, with an eye on high-level metadata, which will still be available in the scenario of end-to-end encryption. Toward this end, we collected Instagram data from 172 youth (ages 13-21) and asked them to identify private message conversations that made them feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Our participants risk-flagged 28,725 conversations that contained 4,181,970 direct messages, including textual posts and images. Based on this rich and multimodal dataset, we tested multiple feature sets (metadata, linguistic cues, and image features) and trained classifiers to detect risky conversations. Overall, we found that the metadata features (e.g., conversation length, a proxy for participant engagement) were the best predictors of risky conversations. However, for distinguishing between risk types, the different linguistic and media cues were the best predictors. Based on our findings, we provide design implications for AI risk detection systems in the presence of end-to-end encryption. More broadly, our work contributes to the literature on adolescent online safety by moving toward more robust solutions for risk detection that directly takes into account the lived risk experiences of youth.",10.1145/3579608,19,Scopus,85153772375,2-s2.0-85153772375,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153772375
Predictors of procrastination in first-year university students: role of achievement goals and learning strategies,Martinie M.A.,2023,Social Psychology of Education,"Procrastination could be conceptualized as a self-regulation failure. However, it is still not clear what type of self-regulation processes are precisely underlying the students’ tendency to procrastinate. The main objective of our study was therefore to predict variations in academic procrastination by considering two constructs related to self-regulation: motivational factors (i.e., achievement goals), and learning strategies: deep learning cognitive strategies -Elaboration and Critical thinking-, effort regulation management. The results of an online study on 249 first-year humanities and social sciences French students showed that 30% of the variance in procrastination was predicted positively by avoidance goals and negatively by effort regulation management. The effort regulation management strategy alone contributed to 24% of the variance in procrastination. Furthermore, the results confirmed the negative relationship between academic performance and procrastination tendency. Added together, these results support the conceptualization of procrastination as a self-regulation failure and specially of learning such as effort regulation management. Results are discussed in relation to possible interventions that aim to reduce procrastination in order to promote academic success and students’ well-being.",10.1007/s11218-022-09743-1,9,Scopus,85144238980,2-s2.0-85144238980,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144238980
Detecting individuals with severe mental illness using artificial intelligence applied to magnetic resonance imaging,Zhang W.,2023,Ebiomedicine,"Background: Identifying individuals at risk for severe mental illness (SMI) is crucial for prevention and early intervention strategies. While MRI shows potential for case identification even before illness onset, no practical model for mental health risk monitoring has been developed. This study aims to develop an initial version of an efficient and practical model for mental health screening among at-risk populations. Methods: A deep learning model known as Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) was adopted to train and test a SMI detection model with clinical MRI scans of 14,915 patients with SMI (age 32.98 ± 12.01 years, 9102 women) and 4538 healthy controls (age 40.60 ± 10.95 years, 2424 women) in the primary dataset. Validation analysis was conducted in an independent dataset with 290 patients (age 28.08 ± 10.95 years, 169 women) and 310 healthy participants (age 33.55 ± 11.09 years, 165 women). Another three machine learning models of ResNet, DenseNet and EfficientNet were used for comparison. We also recruited 148 individuals receiving high-stress medical school education to characterize the potential real-world utility of the MIL model in detecting risk of mental illness. Findings: Similar performance of successful differentiation of individuals with SMI and healthy controls was observed for the MIL model (AUC: 0.82) and other models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, 0.83, 0.81, and 0.80 respectively). MIL had better generalization in the validation test than other models (AUC: 0.82 vs 0.59, 0.66 and 0.59), and less drop-off in performance from 3.0T to 1.5T scanners. The MIL model did better in predicting clinician ratings of distress than self-ratings with questionnaires (84% vs 22%) in the medical student sample. Brain regions that contributed to SMI identification were mainly neocortical, including right precuneus, bilateral temporal regions, left precentral/postcentral gyrus, bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and right cerebellum. Interpretation: Our digital model based on brief clinical MRI protocols identified individual SMI patients with good accuracy and high sensitivity, suggesting that with incremental improvements the approach may offer potentially useful aid for early identification and intervention to prevent illness onset in vulnerable at-risk populations.

NSSI questionnaires revisited: A data mining approach to shorten the NSSI questionnaires,Farajzadeh N.,2023,Plos One,"Background and objective Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a psychological disorder that the sufferer consciously damages their body tissues, often too severe that requires intensive care medicine. As some individuals hide their NSSI behaviors, other people can only identify them if they catch them while injuring, or via dedicated questionnaires. However, questionnaires are long and tedious to answer, thus the answers might be inconsistent. Hence, in this study for the first time, we abstracted a larger questionnaire (of 662 items in total) to own only 22 items (questions) via data mining techniques. Then, we trained several machine learning algorithms to classify individuals based on their answers into two classes. Methods Data from 277 previously-questioned participants is used in several data mining methods to select features (questions) that highly represent NSSI, then 245 different people were asked to participate in an online test to validate those features via machine learning methods. Results The highest accuracy and F1 score of the selected features-via the Genetics algorithm-are 80.0% and 74.8% respectively for a Random Forest algorithm. Cronbach's alpha of the online test (validation on the selected features) is 0.82. Moreover, results suggest that an MLP can classify participants into two classes of NSSI Positive and NSSI Negative with 83.6% accuracy and 83.7% F1-score based on the answers to only 22 questions. Conclusion While previously psychologists used many combined questionnaires to see whether someone is involved in NSSI, via various data mining methods, the present study showed that only 22 questions are enough to predict if someone is involved or not. Then different machine learning algorithms were utilized to classify participants based on their NSSI behaviors, among which, an MLP with 10 hidden layers had the best performance.",10.1371/journal.pone.0284588,3,Scopus,85153553549,2-s2.0-85153553549,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153553549
"A randomized controlled trial of personalized text messages for smoking cessation, China",Lin H.,2023,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,"Objective To describe a tobacco cessation intervention using personalized mobile phone text messages based on behaviour change theory and to assess why the intervention was effective. Methods We conducted a two-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in five cities in China from April to July 2021. We recruited daily or weekly smokers aged 18 years or older. The 90-day intervention was delivered using a mobile phone chat application. At different stages of quitting, intervention group participants received personalized text messages based on analyses of the strength of their intention to quit, their motivation to quit and their self-reported success at quitting. Control group participants received non-personalized text messages. The primary outcome was the biochemically verified 6-month abstinence rate. Secondary outcomes were changes in scores on the components of protection motivation theory. All analyses were by intention to treat. Findings We randomly assigned 722 participants to intervention or control groups. Biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months was 6.9% (25/360) in the intervention group and 3.0% (11/362) in the control group. Smokers who received the personalized intervention had lower scores on intrinsic rewards of smoking and response costs of quitting in the protection motivation theory analysis. These two variables were also determinants of sustained abstinence, thus explaining why the intervention group had a higher quitting rate. Conclusion The study confirmed the psychological determinants of long-term abstinence from smoking and provided a framework to explore why such an intervention is effective. This approach may be applicable to the development or analysis of interventions targeting other health behaviours.",10.2471/BLT.22.289051,6,Scopus,85151378657,2-s2.0-85151378657,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151378657
Validated assessment tools for screen media use: A systematic review,Perez O.,2023,Plos One,"Objective Accurate measurement of adult and child screen media use are needed to robustly assess its impact on health outcomes. Our objective was to systematically review screen media use measurement tools that have been validated against an objective “gold standard” tool. Methods The search strategy was initially conducted in Medline Ovid and translated to Embase, Web of Science, PsychInfo and Cochrane. A modified natural language search was conducted in Google Scholar and IEEE. The initial search was conducted in March 2021, and an updated search was conducted in June 2022. Additional studies were included from the references. Studies had to describe the validation of a tool to measure screen media use on participants of any age against a 'gold standard' or comparable objective measure. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) was used to assess the criterion validity. Four authors reviewed the titles in two rounds and extracted data. Results Twenty-nine articles were included in the review. Studies measured TV, computer, mobile device and social media site screen media use through: self or parent report, direct or video observation, computer and mobile device use tracking programs, and through other novel devices such as wearable devices and cameras. Correlations of self or parent report of screen media with the gold standard were lower than correlations of technology-based measures, and video observation with the gold standard. The COSMIN criterion validity ratings ranged from poor to excellent; most of the studies received a global score of fair or poor. Conclusions Technology based validated tools that more directly measure screen use are emerging that have been validated against a gold standard for measuring screen use. However, practical, objective measures of diverse types of screen media use that have been tested on diverse populations are needed to better understand the impact of screen media use on the development and physical and mental health of children and adults.",10.1371/journal.pone.0283714,23,Scopus,85152590830,2-s2.0-85152590830,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152590830
Using natural language processing to identify child maltreatment in health systems,Negriff S.,2023,Child Abuse and Neglect,"Background: Rates of child maltreatment (CM) obtained from electronic health records are much lower than national child welfare prevalence rates indicate. There is a need to understand how CM is documented to improve reporting and surveillance. Objectives: To examine whether using natural language processing (NLP) in outpatient chart notes can identify cases of CM not documented by ICD diagnosis code, the overlap between the coding of child maltreatment by ICD and NLP, and any differences by age, gender, or race/ethnicity. Methods: Outpatient chart notes of children age 0–18 years old within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) 2018–2020 were used to examine a selected set of maltreatment-related terms categorized into concept unique identifiers (CUI). Manual review of text snippets for each CUI was completed to flag for validated cases and retrain the NLP algorithm. Results: The NLP results indicated a crude rate of 1.55 % to 2.36 % (2018–2020) of notes with reference to CM. The rate of CM identified by ICD code was 3.32 per 1000 children, whereas the rate identified by NLP was 37.38 per 1000 children. The groups that increased the most in identification of maltreatment from ICD to NLP were adolescents (13–18 yrs. old), females, Native American children, and those on Medicaid. Of note, all subgroups had substantially higher rates of maltreatment when using NLP. Conclusions: Use of NLP substantially increased the estimated number of children who have been impacted by CM. Accurately capturing this population will improve identification of vulnerable youth at high risk for mental health symptoms.",10.1016/j.chiabu.2023.106090,7,Scopus,85147591977,2-s2.0-85147591977,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147591977
Using Machine Learning to Explore the Risk Factors of Problematic Smartphone Use among Canadian Adolescents during COVID-19: The Important Role of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO),Xiao B.,2023,Applied Sciences Switzerland,"The goal of the present study was to use machine learning to identify how gender, age, ethnicity, screen time, internalizing problems, self-regulation, and FoMO were related to problematic smartphone use in a sample of Canadian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were N = 2527 (1269 boys; M<inf>age</inf> = 15.17 years, SD = 1.48 years) high school students from the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. Data on problematic smartphone use, screen time, internalizing problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress), self-regulation, and FoMO were collected via an online questionnaire. Several different machine learning algorithms were used to train the statistical model of predictive variables in predicting problematic smartphone use. The results indicated that Shrinkage algorithms (lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression) performed better than other algorithms. Moreover, FoMO, emotional, and cognitive self-regulation made the largest relative contribution to predicting problematic smartphone use.

Exploring Korean adolescent stress on social media: a semantic network analysis,Song J.H.,2023,Peerj,"Background. Considering that adolescents spend considerable time on the Internet and social media and experience high levels of stress, it is difficult to find a study that investigates adolescent stress through a big data-based network analysis of social media. Hence, this study was designed to provide basic data to establish desirable stress coping strategies for adolescents based on a big data-based network analysis of social media for Korean adolescent stress. The purpose of this study was to (1) identify social media words that express stress in adolescents and (2) investigate the associations between those words and their types. Methods. To analyse adolescent stress, we used social media data collected from online news and blog websites and performed semantic network analysis to understand the relationships among keywords extracted in the collected data. Results. The top five words used by Korean adolescents were counselling, school, suicide, depression, and activity in online news, and diet, exercise, eat, health, and obesity in blogs. As the top keywords of the blog are mainly related to diet and obesity, it reflects adolescents’ high degree of interest in their bodies; the body is also a primary source of adolescent stress. In addition, blogs contained more content about the causes and symptoms of stress than online news, which focused more on stress resolution and coping. This highlights the trend that social blogging is a new channel for sharing personal information. Conclusions.

Designing Supportive Conversational Agents with and for Teens,Lopatovska I.,2023,Chiir 2023 Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval,"The study involved adolescents (teens) in exploring the potential of conversational agents (CAs) to support adolescents during emotionally difficult times. During the online focus groups, participants were asked to talk about common problems they are experiencing and the conversational support they usually receive, design multi-turn supportive conversations that could be programmed into a CA, and offer recommendations for the features of supportive CAs for teens. Participants talked about stressful experiences that were reported in previous studies, i.e. school and family related problems, peer relationships, and self-image, suggesting that CAs can be programmed to anticipate and address stress/negative emotions related to these common stressors. In expressing preferences for conversational support, participants highlighted the importance of both cognitive (informational) and emotional dimensions in agents' responses. The findings point to the importance of developing CA content that offers teens advice on strategies to cope with negative emotion (advice on behavior change, self-care strategies), and also simply acknowledges their problems and lands an emotional ""hearing ear"".",10.1145/3576840.3578283,4,Scopus,85151457020,2-s2.0-85151457020,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151457020
Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Sleep Problems with Wearable Data in Children,Kim W.P.,2023,JAMA Network Open,"Importance: Early detection of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sleep problems is paramount for children's mental health. Interview-based diagnostic approaches have drawbacks, necessitating the development of an evaluation method that uses digital phenotypes in daily life. Objective: To evaluate the predictive performance of machine learning (ML) models by setting the data obtained from personal digital devices comprising training features (ie, wearable data) and diagnostic results of ADHD and sleep problems by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime Version for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (K-SADS) as a prediction class from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic study, wearable data and K-SADS data were collected at 21 sites in the US in the ABCD study (release 3.0, November 2, 2020, analyzed October 11, 2021). Screening data from 6571 patients and 21 days of wearable data from 5725 patients collected at the 2-year follow-up were used, and circadian rhythm-based features were generated for each participant. A total of 12348 wearable data for ADHD and 39160 for sleep problems were merged for developing ML models. Main Outcomes and Measures: The average performance of the ML models was measured using an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). In addition, the Shapley Additive Explanations value was used to calculate the importance of features. Results: The final population consisted of 79 children with ADHD problems (mean [SD] age, 144.5 [8.1] months; 55 [69.6%] males) vs 1011 controls and 68 with sleep problems (mean [SD] age, 143.5 [7.5] months; 38 [55.9%] males) vs 3346 controls. The ML models showed reasonable predictive performance for ADHD (AUC, 0.798; sensitivity, 0.756; specificity, 0.716; PPV, 0.159; and NPV, 0.976) and sleep problems (AUC, 0.737; sensitivity, 0.743; specificity, 0.632; PPV, 0.036; and NPV, 0.992). Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic study, an ML method for early detection or screening using digital phenotypes in children's daily lives was developed. The results support facilitating early detection in children; however, additional follow-up studies can improve its performance.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.3502,43,Scopus,85150661322,2-s2.0-85150661322,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150661322
Characterizing inflammatory profiles of suicidal behavior in adolescents: Rationale and design,Chin Fatt C.,2023,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: The suicide rate in youth and young adults continues to climb – we do not understand why this increase is occurring, nor do we have adequate tools to predict or prevent it. Increased efforts to treat underlying depression and other disorders that are highly associated with suicide have had limited impact, despite considerable financial investments in developing and disseminating available methods. Thus, there is a tremendous need to identify potential markers of suicide behavior for youth during this high-risk period. Methods: Funded by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), this study aims to map immune dysfunction to suicidal behavior and establish a reliable immune signature of suicide risk that can 1) guide future research into fundamental pathophysiology and 2) identify targets for drug development. The study design is an observational study where blood samples and a comprehensive array of clinical measures are collected from three groups of adolescents (n = 75 each) (1) with suicidal behavior [recent (within 3 months) suicide attempt or suicidal ideation warranting urgent evaluation,] (2) at risk for mood disorders, and (3) who are healthy (no psychiatric history). Participants will complete self-report and clinical assessments, along with a blood draw, at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months, and online self-report assessments once a month. Results: The recruitment for this study is ongoing. Limitations: Observational, variability in treatment regimens. Conclusions: This study will help elucidate immune mechanisms that may play a causal role in suicide and serve as targets for future therapeutic development.",10.1016/j.jad.2022.12.114,1,Scopus,85146335768,2-s2.0-85146335768,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146335768
Sleep Quality Prediction from Wearables using Convolution Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning,Kilic O.,2023,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Sleep is among the most important factors affecting one's daily performance, well-being, and life quality. Nevertheless, it became possible to measure it in daily life in an unobtrusive manner with wearable devices. Rather than camera recordings and extraction of the state from the images, wrist-worn devices can measure directly via accelerometer, heart rate, and heart rate variability sensors. Some measured features can be as follows: time to bed, time out of bed, bedtime duration, minutes to fall asleep, and minutes after wake-up. There are several studies in the literature regarding sleep quality and stage prediction. However, they use only wearable data to predict or focus on the sleep stage. In this study, we use the NetHealth dataset, which is collected from 698 college students' via wearables, as well as surveys. Recently, there has been an advancement in deep learning algorithms, and they generally perform better than conventional machine learning techniques. Among them, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have high performances. Thus, in this study, we apply different CNN architectures that have already performed well in the human activity recognition domain and compare their results. We also apply Random Forest (RF) since it performs best among the conventional methods. In future studies, we will compare them with other deep learning algorithms.",10.1145/3589883.3589900,2,Scopus,85167796421,2-s2.0-85167796421,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167796421
Logistic Regression With Machine Learning Sheds Light on the Problematic Sexual Behavior Phenotype,Jiang S.,2023,Journal of Addiction Medicine,"Objectives There has been a longstanding debate about whether the mechanisms involved in problematic sexual behavior (PSB) are similar to those observed in addictive disorders, or related to impulse control or to compulsivity. The aim of this report was to contribute to this debate by investigating the association between PSB, addictive disorders (internet addiction, compulsive buying), measures associated with the construct known as reward deficiency (RDS), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Methods A Canadian university Office of the Registrar invited 68,846 eligible students and postdoctoral fellows. Of 4710 expressing interest in participating, 3359 completed online questionnaires, and 1801 completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. PSB was measured by combining those screening positive (score at least 6) on the Sexual Addiction Screening Test - Revised Core with those self-reporting PSB. Current mental health condition(s) and childhood trauma were measured by self-report. OCD was assessed by a combination of self-report and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview data. Results Of 3341 participants, 407 (12.18%) screened positive on the Sexual Addiction Screening Test - Revised Core. On logistic regression, OCD, attention deficit, internet addiction, a family history of PSB, childhood trauma, compulsive buying, and male gender were associated with PSB. On multiple correspondence analysis, OCD appeared to cluster separately from the other measures, and the pattern of data differed by gender. Conclusions In our sample, factors that have previously been associated with RDS and OCD are both associated with increased odds of PSB. The factors associated with RDS appear to contribute to a separate data cluster from OCD and to lie closer to PSB.",10.1097/ADM.0000000000001078,4,Scopus,85150155339,2-s2.0-85150155339,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150155339
"Pragmatic Clinical Trial of Population Health, Portal-Based Depression Screening: the PORTAL-Depression Study",Franco M.I.,2023,Journal of General Internal Medicine,"Background: A population health approach to depression screening using patient portals may be a promising strategy to proactively engage and identify patients with depression. Objective: To determine whether a population health approach to depression screening is more effective than screening during clinic appointments alone for identifying patients with depression. Design: A pragmatic clinical trial at an adult outpatient internal medicine clinic at an urban, academic, tertiary care center. Patients: Eligible patients (n = 2713) were adults due for depression screening with active portal accounts. Patients with documented depression or bipolar disorder and those who had been screened in the year prior to the study were excluded. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to usual (n = 1372) or population healthcare (n = 1341). For usual care, patients were screened by medical assistants during clinic appointments. Population healthcare patients were sent letters through the portal inviting them to fill out an online screener regardless of whether they had a scheduled appointment. The same screening tool, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH™), was used for clinic- and portal-based screening. Main Measures: The primary outcome was the depression screening rate. Key Results: The depression screening rate in the population healthcare arm was higher than that in the usual care arm (43% (n = 578) vs. 33% (n = 459), p < 0.0001). The rate of positive screens was also higher in the population healthcare arm compared to that in the usual care (10% (n = 58) vs. 4% (n = 17), p < 0.001). Conclusion: Findings suggest depression screening via a portal as part of a population health approach can increase screening and case identification, compared to usual care.

Word usage in spontaneous speech as a predictor of depressive symptoms among youth at high risk for mood disorders,Weintraub M.J.,2023,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: We examined whether digital phenotyping of spontaneous speech, such as the use of specific word categories during speech samples, was associated with depressive symptoms in youth who were at familial and clinical risk for mood disorders. Methods: Participants (ages 13–19) had active mood symptoms, mood instability, and at least one parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder. During a randomized trial of family-focused therapy, participants were instructed to make weekly calls to a central voice server and leave speech samples in response to automated prompts. We coded youths' speech samples with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count system and used machine learning to identify the combination of speech features that were most closely associated with the course of depressive symptoms over 18 weeks. Results: A total of 253 speech samples were collected from 44 adolescents (mean age = 15.8 years; SD = 1.6) over 18 weeks. Speech containing affective processes, social processes, drives toward risk or reward, nonfluencies, and time orientation words were correlated with depressive symptoms at concurrent time periods (ps < 0.01). Machine learning analyses revealed that affective processes, nonfluencies, drives and risk words combined to most strongly predict changes in depressive symptoms over 18 weeks of treatment. Limitations: Study results were limited by the small sample and the exclusion of paralinguistic or contextual variables in analyzing speech samples. Conclusions: In youth at high risk for mood disorders, knowledge of speech patterns may inform prognoses during outpatient psychosocial treatment.",10.1016/j.jad.2022.12.047,9,Scopus,85143970077,2-s2.0-85143970077,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143970077
Association between impaired glucose metabolism and long-term prognosis at the time of diagnosis of depression: Impaired glucose metabolism as a promising biomarker proposed through a machine-learning approach,Lee D.Y.,2023,European Psychiatry,"Background Predicting the course of depression is necessary for personalized treatment. Impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) was introduced as a promising depression biomarker, but no consensus was made. This study aimed to predict IGM at the time of depression diagnosis and examine the relationship between long-term prognosis and predicted results. Methods Clinical data were extracted from four electronic health records in South Korea. The study population included patients with depression, and the outcome was IGM within 1 year. One database was used to develop the model using three algorithms. External validation was performed using the best algorithm across the three databases. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to determine the model's performance. Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analyses of the risk of hospitalization for depression as the long-term outcome were performed. A meta-analysis of the long-term outcome was performed across the four databases. Results A prediction model was developed using the data of 3,668 people, with an AUC of 0.781 with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. In the external validation, the AUCs were 0.643, 0.610, and 0.515. Through the predicted results, survival analysis and meta-analysis were performed; the hazard ratios of risk of hospitalization for depression in patients predicted to have IGM was 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.41, p = 0.027) at a 3-year follow-up. Conclusions We developed prediction models for IGM occurrence within a year. The predicted results were related to the long-term prognosis of depression, presenting as a promising IGM biomarker related to the prognosis of depression.",10.1192/j.eurpsy.2023.10,8,Scopus,85148090514,2-s2.0-85148090514,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148090514
The design of a mental health service platform for college students based on multi-modal information,Schislyaeva E.R.,2023,Microprocessors and Microsystems,"Mental health plays a significant role in the comprehensive growth and development of college students. It refers to the positive development of the mental state which determines their mental or physical potential. The mental health problems of college students increase day by day and become a crucial aspect for families, colleges, universities and society. In existing methods, issues occur due to large variations in the symptoms of mental illness which further results in more than one disease condition at the same time. This creates complexities in the accurate diagnosis of mental health. Based on the present situation of student's mental health, an early warning platform is developed for observing the effect of social media, bad emotions and other factors on the minds of college students. Subsequently, relevant treatment is provided to overcome the diseases caused by mental illness and to improve mental health. Mental health platforms are constructed to improve the health state of college or university students and protect them from psychological crisis. In this paper, a specific framework and module for testing and training schemes based on deep neural model for the analysis of mental state of college students is introduced.

"Observational prospective study of social media, smartphone use and self-harm in a clinical sample of young people: Study protocol",Bye A.,2023,BMJ Open,"Introduction Young people are the most frequent users of social media and smartphones and there has been an increasing speculation about the potential negative impacts of their use on mental health. This has coincided with a sharp increase in the levels of self-harm in young people. To date, studies researching this potential association are predominantly cross-sectional and reliant on self-report data, which precludes the ability to objectively analyse behaviour over time. This study is one of the first attempts to explore temporal patterns of real-world usage prior to self-harm, to identify whether there are usage patterns associated with an increased risk. Methods and analysis To study the mechanisms by which social media and smartphone use underpin self-harm in a clinical sample of young people, the Social media, Smartphone use and Self-harm in Young People (3S-YP) study uses a prospective, observational study design. Up to 600 young people aged 13-25 years old from secondary mental health services will be recruited and followed for up to 6 months. Primary analysis will compare real-world data in the 7 days leading up to a participant or clinician recorded self-harm episode, to categorise patterns of problematic usage. Secondary analyses will explore potential mediating effects of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, loneliness and bullying.

Development of a chatbot for depression: adolescent perceptions and recommendations,Dosovitsky G.,2023,Child and Adolescent Mental Health,"Background: Chatbots are a relatively new technology that has shown promising outcomes for mental health symptoms in adults; however, few studies have been done with adolescents or reported adolescent user experiences and recommendations for chatbot development. Methods: Twenty three participants ages 13–18 (M<inf>age</inf> = 14.96) engaged in user testing of a chatbot developed to psychoeducate adolescents on depression, teach behavioral activation, and change negative thoughts. Thematic analysis was conducted of participants' responses to user experience questions, impressions, and recommendations. Results: Over half (56.5%) of the sample completed the full intervention and provided user experience feedback online. The average NPS score was 6.04 (SD = 2.18), and 64.3% (n = 9) said they would use the chatbot in the future. Of all user experience responses, 54.5% were positive. The most common impressions were related to symptom improvement (61.1%) and availability (52.8%) The most frequent recommendations were related to solving technical problems (66%). Conclusions: Chatbots for mental health are acceptable to some adolescents, a population that tends to be reluctant to engage with traditional mental health services. Most participants reported positive experiences with the chatbot, believing that it could help with symptom improvement and is highly available. Adolescents highlighted some technical and stylistic problems that developers should consider. More pilot and user testing is needed to develop mental health chatbots that are appealing and relevant to adolescents.",10.1111/camh.12627,34,Scopus,85144143909,2-s2.0-85144143909,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144143909
"AI-based chatbot micro-intervention for parents: Meaningful engagement, learning, and efficacy",Entenberg G.A.,2023,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: Mental health issues have been on the rise among children and adolescents, and digital parenting programs have shown promising outcomes. However, there is limited research on the potential efficacy of utilizing chatbots to promote parental skills. This study aimed to understand whether parents learn from a parenting chatbot micro intervention, to assess the overall efficacy of the intervention, and to explore the user characteristics of the participants, including parental busyness, assumptions about parenting, and qualitative engagement with the chatbot. Methods: A sample of 170 parents with at least one child between 2–11 years old were recruited. A randomized control trial was conducted. Participants in the experimental group accessed a 15-min intervention that taught how to utilize positive attention and praise to promote positive behaviors in their children, while the control group remained on a waiting list. Results: Results showed that participants engaged with a brief AI-based chatbot intervention and were able to learn effective praising skills. Although scores moved in the expected direction, there were no significant differences by condition in the praising knowledge reported by parents, perceived changes in disruptive behaviors, or parenting self-efficacy, from pre-intervention to 24-hour follow-up. Discussion: The results provided insight to understand how parents engaged with the chatbot and suggests that, in general, brief, self-guided, digital interventions can promote learning in parents. It is possible that a higher dose of intervention may be needed to obtain a therapeutic change in parents. Further research implications on chatbots for parenting skills are discussed.",10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1080770,20,Scopus,85147357938,2-s2.0-85147357938,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147357938
Identifying Chinese social media users' need for affect from their online behaviors,Deng H.,2023,Frontiers in Public Health,"The need for affect (NFA), which refers to the motivation to approach or avoid emotion-inducing situations, is a valuable indicator of mental health monitoring and intervention, as well as many other applications. Traditionally, NFA has been measured using self-reports, which is not applicable in today's online scenarios due to its shortcomings in fast, large-scale assessments. This study proposed an automatic and non-invasive method for recognizing NFA based on social media behavioral data. The NFA questionnaire scores of 934 participants and their social media data were acquired. Then we run machine learning algorithms to train predictive models, which can be used to automatically identify NFA degrees of online users. The results showed that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) performed best among several algorithms. The Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted scores and NFA questionnaire scores achieved 0.25 (NFA avoidance), 0.31 (NFA approach) and 0.34 (NFA total), and the split-half reliabilities were 0.66–0.70. Our research demonstrated that adolescents' NFA can be identified based on their social media behaviors, and opened a novel way of non-intrusively perceiving users' NFA which can be used for mental health monitoring and other situations that require large-scale NFA measurements.",10.3389/fpubh.2022.1045279,2,Scopus,85146968731,2-s2.0-85146968731,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146968731
Exploring the Perceptions of mHealth Interventions for the Prevention of Common Mental Disorders in University Students in Singapore: Qualitative Study,Salamanca-Sanabria A.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Mental health interventions delivered through mobile health (mHealth) technologies can increase the access to mental health services, especially among university students. The development of mHealth intervention is complex and needs to be context sensitive. There is currently limited evidence on the perceptions, needs, and barriers related to these interventions in the Southeast Asian context. Objective: This qualitative study aimed to explore the perception of university students and mental health supporters in Singapore about mental health services, campaigns, and mHealth interventions with a focus on conversational agent interventions for the prevention of common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. Methods: We conducted 6 web-based focus group discussions with 30 university students and one-to-one web-based interviews with 11 mental health supporters consisting of faculty members tasked with student pastoral care, a mental health first aider, counselors, psychologists, a clinical psychologist, and a psychiatrist. The qualitative analysis followed a reflexive thematic analysis framework. Results: The following 6 main themes were identified: a healthy lifestyle as students, access to mental health services, the role of mental health promotion campaigns, preferred mHealth engagement features, factors that influence the adoption of mHealth interventions, and cultural relevance of mHealth interventions. The interpretation of our findings shows that students were reluctant to use mental health services because of the fear of stigma and a possible lack of confidentiality. Conclusions: Study participants viewed mHealth interventions for mental health as part of a blended intervention. They also felt that future mental health mHealth interventions should be more personalized and capable of managing adverse events such as suicidal ideation.",10.2196/44542,13,Scopus,85150752327,2-s2.0-85150752327,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150752327
Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy Versus Treatment as Usual for Anxiety and Depression Among Latin American University Students: A Randomized Clinical Trial,Benjet C.,2023,Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,"Objective: Untreated mental disorders are important among low-and middle-income country (LMIC) university students in Latin America, where barriers to treatment are high. Scalable interventions are needed. This study compared transdiagnostic self-guided and guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (i-CBT) with treatment as usual (TAU) for clinically significant anxiety and depression among undergraduates in Colombia and Mexico. Method: 1,319 anxious, as determined by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 (GAD-7) = 10+ and/or depressed, as determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9) = 10+, undergraduates (mean [SD] age = 21.4 [3.2]); 78.7% female; 55.9% first-generation university student) from seven universities in Colombia and Mexico were randomized to culturally adapted versions of self-guided i-CBT (n = 439), guided i-CBT (n = 445), or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 435). All randomized participants were reassessed 3 months after randomization. The primary outcome was remission of both anxiety (GAD-7 = 0–4) and depression (PHQ-9 = 0–4). We hypothesized that remission would be higher with guided i-CBT than with the other interventions. Results: Intent-to-treat analysis found significantly higher adjusted (for university and loss to follow-up) remission rates (ARD) among participants randomized to guided i-CBT than either self-guided i-CBT (ARD = 13.1%, χ2 1 = 10.4, p =.001) or TAU (ARD = 11.2%, χ2 1 = 8.4, p =.004), but no significant difference between self-guided i-CBT and TAU (ARD = −1.9%, χ2 1 = 0.2, p =.63). Per-protocol sensitivity analyses and analyses of dimensional outcomes yielded similar results. Conclusions: Significant reductions in anxiety and depression among LMIC university students could be achieved with guided i-CBT, although further research is needed to determine which students would most likely benefit from this intervention.",10.1037/ccp0000846,18,Scopus,85178649391,2-s2.0-85178649391,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178649391
Mental Health Prediction in Students using Data Mining Techniques,Sahu B.,2023,Open Bioinformatics Journal,"Background: Mental health issues are common among university students. Depression poses a significant obstacle to long-term learning and the viability of the educational system as a whole. Many students enroll in colleges in other states, leaving their friends and family behind. Some students struggle to adjust to competition in a foreign setting and the pressures of college. With numerous technical and non-technical universities, Odisha is currently rising as the center of education. There has been much research that has examined mental health issues in India, but few of them specifically target university students in Odisha. Our study aimed to predict the prevalence, factors, and effects of mental health problems (depression, social connectedness, and anxiety disorder) on college students in Odisha. Methods: An online survey was conducted that was circulated to several student classes at 3 colleges of an university, and it yielded 109 results. The survey included socio-demographic information along with the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), the Revised Social Connectedness Scale (SCS), and a nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale. Correlation analysis has been applied to identify the correlation among attributes and regression analysis was applied for the prediction of the mental health status of the students based on the given attribute. Results: The prevalence rate of depression among students was determined to be 61.90%. Years of college and physical health showed a significant correlation with depression. Students in the early years of college have shown a greater depression rate. It was observed that anxiety and depression were positively correlated and social connectedness and depression were negatively correlated. We also found academic performance and depression to be correlated with each other. The hyperparameter-tuned logistic regression model provided better result in comparison to the other existing models in the literature. Conclusion: The findings hint at the high prevalence of depression in students and its association with anxiety disorders, social connectedness, and academic performance.

Design and Implementation of a Student Psychological Assessment and Counseling System Under Data Mining Algorithms,Li L.,2023,Proceedings 2023 International Conference on Computer Science and Automation Technology Csat 2023,"With the rapid development of Chinese society and the growing population, various competitions between people are also intensifying. The increasing social and life pressures faced by college students have led to increasingly prominent psychological issues. According to the 2022 psychological assessment of college students conducted by China People's Daily Online, nearly one-third of Chinese college students across China would suffer from serious psychological problems caused by life pressure, such as confusion and anxiety, frequent self-depression, conflicting interpersonal relationships, and the inability to vent their inner emotions normally. The mental health issues of college students would be a major issue in Chinese society, and it is necessary to develop an effective method to solve the psychological problems of college students, helping them better cope with the pressure from life. This article aims to study a student psychological assessment and counseling system based on data mining algorithms, in order to improve the ability of college students to withstand life and social pressure, and to enhance the scientific and effective aspects of college student psychological counseling. The continuous development and research of information technology, technology, and artificial intelligence, especially in the areas of big data and artificial intelligence, have provided tremendous assistance and technical support for conducting student psychological assessment and counseling work. The student psychological assessment and counseling system based on data mining algorithms can help students solve their own psychological problems faster and provide more humane and personalized counseling solutions for students. This article would be validated through simulation experiments and performance experiments of the student psychological assessment and counseling system. In the simulation experiment, the accuracy of the student psychological assessment and tutoring system under the data mining algorithm was higher than 90%. The recall rate is above 80%, with the highest accuracy rate of 99% and the highest recall rate of 99%. From this, it can be seen that the performance of the student psychological assessment and counseling system based on data mining algorithms is better, which can accurately evaluate the psychological status of students and provide a basis for their psychological counseling and plans.",10.1109/CSAT61646.2023.00059,0,Scopus,85190443429,2-s2.0-85190443429,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190443429
"Machine Learning for Prediction of Nutritional Psychology, Fast Food Consumption and Its Impact on Students",Rainchwar P.P.,2023,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"The intake of fast food is rapidly accelerating due to the factors specifically the cost-effectiveness and being tasty, but not all individuals are aware of its harmful long-term effects on physical and mental health. On the issue of nutrition and fast food intake this is an unexplored field of research so far. In this paper, we have profoundly analyzed the relationship using Machine Learning models, which is a new approach for nutrition-based analysis. A general questionnaire is prepared dealing with all the factors of nutrition and the immune system. The survey was hosted on an online platform and participants were college students from MIT WPU School of Engineering. Responses were then analyzed implying onto the food-habits and eating behavior using Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Extremely Randomized Trees. According to our understanding and knowledge, this is the earliest research to include all these factors along-with Machine Learning algorithms especially on college students as target audience. The primary objective is to apply association, classification, and regression algorithms in order to predict BMI, sickness, pre-COVID and post-COVID eating schedule and the experiments conducted during this research reveal that this method significantly improves the analysis of real-world data as compared to the traditional statistical approach with a commendable accuracy of 98%.",10.1007/978-981-99-4634-1_80,0,Scopus,85177830512,2-s2.0-85177830512,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177830512
"Intention to use digital mental health solutions: A cross-sectional survey of university students attitudes and perceptions toward online therapy, mental health apps, and chatbots",Gbollie E.F.,2023,Digital Health,"Background: Globally, the high prevalence of mental disorders among university students is a growing public health problem, yet a small minority of students with mental health problems receive treatment. Digital mental health solutions could bridge treatment gaps and overcome many barriers students face accessing treatment. However, there is scant evidence, especially in South Africa (SA), relating to university students’ use of and intention to use digital mental health solutions or their attitudes towards these technologies. We aim to explore university 2students attitudes towards and perceptions of digital mental health solutions, and the factors associated with their intention to use them. Methods: University students from four SA universities (n = 17 838) completed an online survey to assess experience with, attitudes and perceptions of, and intentions to use, digital mental health solutions. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis to identify factors underlying attitudes and perceptions, and then used multivariate ordinal regression analysis was used to investigate the factors’ association with students’ intention to use digital mental health solutions. Results: Intention to use digital mental health solutions was high, and attitudes towards and perceptions of digital mental health solutions were largely positive. Importantly, our analysis also shows that 12.6% of users were willing to utilise some form of digital mental health solutions but were unwilling to utilise traditional face-to-face therapies. The greatest proportion of variance was explained by the factor ‘Attitudes towards digital technologies’ utility to improve student counselling services, provided they are safe’. Conclusion: SA university students are already engaging with digital mental health solutions, and their intention to do so is high. Certain attitudes and perceptions, particularly concerning the utility, effectiveness, and safety, underlie willingness to engage with these solutions, providing potential targets for interventions to increase uptake.",10.1177/20552076231216559,15,Scopus,85178486262,2-s2.0-85178486262,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178486262
Digital Phenotyping Data to Predict Symptom Improvement and Mental Health App Personalization in College Students: Prospective Validation of a Predictive Model,Currey D.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Mental health apps offer a transformative means to increase access to scalable evidence-based care for college students. Yet low rates of engagement currently preclude the effectiveness of these apps. One promising solution is to make these apps more responsive and personalized through digital phenotyping methods able to predict symptoms and offer tailored interventions. Objective: Following our protocol and using the exact model shared in that paper, our primary aim in this study is to assess the prospective validity of mental health symptom prediction using the mindLAMP app through a replication study. We also explored secondary aims around app intervention personalization and correlations of engagement with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Digital Working Alliance Inventory scale in the context of automating the study. Methods: The study was 28 days in duration and followed the published protocol, with participants collecting digital phenotyping data and being offered optional scheduled and algorithm-recommended app interventions. Study compensation was tied to the completion of weekly surveys and was not otherwise tied to engagement or use of the app. Results: The data from 67 participants were used in this analysis. The area under the curve values for the symptom prediction model ranged from 0.58 for the UCLA Loneliness Scale to 0.71 for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Engagement with the scheduled app interventions was high, with a study mean of 73%, but few participants engaged with the optional recommended interventions. The perceived utility of the app in the TAM was higher (P=.01) among those completing at least one recommended intervention. Conclusions: Our results suggest how digital phenotyping methods can be used to create generalizable models that may help create more personalized and engaging mental health apps. Automating studies is feasible, and our results suggest targets to increase engagement in future studies.",10.2196/39258,17,Scopus,85147834143,2-s2.0-85147834143,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147834143

The generation, which was previously regarded as being the easiest going is currently experiencing a great deal of stress. Stress can cause a number of problems every day, notably anxiety, suicide, cardiac arrest, as well as strokes. This study measures the students' mental stress a week prior to their examination and while participants utilize the internet. Analysis of stress among college students at various stages of life is the proposed research goal, the stress may be due to exam stress or recruitment stress on the student. This study has analyzed how these influence a student's cognition and examine the relationship between stress and online time. Machine learning technology is crucial for categorizing and predicting anxiety levels during various stages. Many machine learning approaches, such as a Decision tree, Support vector machine, Nave Bayes, and KNN have been employed to predict college students' levels of stress.

College students-in-the-loop for their mental health: a case of AI and humans working together to support well-being,Alves V.D.C.,2023,Interaction Design and Architecture S,"Technology plays a relevant role in mental health. Specifically, integrating pervasive technologies with artificial intelligence (AI) holds promising potential to collect users' data, monitor individuals daily, and support treatment. However, the lack of trust in the collected data is a common limitation of prior work on mental health and technology. This paper proposes involving the user in a Human-in-the-loop approach as a solution to deal with the lack of accuracy of data collected through pervasive technology. In our study, end users judged and evaluated the data collected at two different times: before training the computational model, which would be later used for classification; and afterward to evaluate newly collected data that would be predicted and classified by the model. The solution proposed was implemented and tested in a project related to depression in college students.

Examination of Cultural Influences on Mental Health Among College Students in Chinese Healthcare Educational Institutions,Liu J.,2023,Journal of Commercial Biotechnology,"The intricate relationship between culture and mental health has been a subject of fascination and study throughout history, often explored through artistic expressions and cultural narratives. In popular culture, perceptions of mental illness frequently paint individuals with mental health disorders as aggressive or as intriguing outsiders, deviating from societal norms. Such portrayals, while adding a layer of intrigue in media representations, can often oversimplify and stigmatize mental health issues, creating a misleading and one-dimensional view of those experiencing mental illnesses. In this study, we delve into the nuanced role of popular culture, particularly through the lens of digital media accessibility via smartphones, in shaping mental health perceptions among college students in Chinese healthcare educational institutions. This research aims to uncover how cultural representations and norms influence the mental wellbeing of these students, considering the unique socio-cultural context of China. Our study involved a cohort of students, who, over the course of a month, engaged with an AI-driven mental health awareness program via their smartphones. The findings revealed a notable increase in stress awareness, a decrease in symptoms related to depression, and the adoption of more effective stress management techniques. Interestingly, participants who received AI-generated suggestions without the ability to modify them tended to adopt more beneficial coping strategies, highlighting the impact of guided digital interventions in mental health management. This research underscores the potent influence of cultural narratives and digital media on the mental health of college students in healthcare institutions in China. By examining the intersection of culture, digital media, and mental health, this study provides insights into how popular culture, mediated through technology, can both challenge and reinforce mental health stigmas and practices in a specific educational and cultural setting.",10.5912/jcb1212,1,Scopus,85183833808,2-s2.0-85183833808,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183833808
Loneliness Forecasting Using Multi-modal Wearable and Mobile Sensing in Everyday Settings,Yang Z.,2023,2023 IEEE 19th International Conference on Body Sensor Networks Bsn 2023 Proceedings,"The adverse effects of loneliness on both physical and mental well-being are profound. Although previous research has utilized mobile sensing techniques to detect mental health issues, few studies have utilized state-of-the-art wearable devices to forecast loneliness and comprehend the physiological manifestations of loneliness and its predictive nature. The primary objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of forecasting loneliness by employing wearable devices, such as smart rings and watches, to monitor early physiological indicators of loneliness. Furthermore, smartphones are employed to capture initial behavioral signs of loneliness. To accomplish this, we employed personalized machine learning techniques, leveraging a comprehensive dataset comprising physiological and behavioral information obtained during our study involving the monitoring of college students.

Fitweet: Arduino-Based Smartwatch for Early Anticipatory Anxiety Notification System,Abdulmanab M.R.,2023,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"As anxiety becomes increasingly prevalent among youths especially university students, early prevention via anxiety disorder profiling is crucial. Nevertheless, most screening tools to date are not automated, labour-intensive and time-consuming. Mental health detection in online social networks (OSNs) using artificial intelligence (AI) can provide means for capturing overlooked behavioural attributes, but few are centred around anxiety detection. Internet of Things (IoT)’s increasing popularity enables bio-signals monitoring to aid in mental health care. However, minimum research has been devoted to IoT-based assistive technologies for anxiety, which currently are only used by individuals already diagnosed and actively monitored. This study proposes a novel approach to anticipatory anxiety detection for Malaysian university students aged between 18 and 25 inclusive as an early notification system using AI and IoT for bilingual Malay and English tweets and vital signs analysis respectively. Our result shows that Logistic Regression with Bag-of-Words (BoW) is the overall best performing model with 81.06% accuracy. The Arduino smartwatch sensor readings from the MAX30102 pulse oximeter sensor are used to determine different body conditions using a rule-based approach. The comparison test result between the prototype and conventional measuring devices shows the prototype’s ability to accurately distinguish vital signs with a relatively low Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) rate of 10.92% and 1.51% for pulse rate and temperature respectively. Together, our proof-of-concept results indicate the potential of AI and IoT in deriving new measures of anxiety, by analysing social data combined with bio-signals monitoring to alert users regarding their anxiety state.",10.1007/978-981-19-8406-8_21,1,Scopus,85161387581,2-s2.0-85161387581,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161387581
Depression recognition in university students based on speech features in social learning environment,Qu M.,2023,Proceedings 2023 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education Icaie 2023,"With the continuous development of society, the competition between people is becoming more and more fierce. No matter it is offline classroom group discussion, thematic report or online learning platform in the COVID-19 epidemic era, social learning cannot escape. In the online and offline communication between students, emotions often play a decisive role in the way students speech. Therefore, the phonetic materials of students' speech in social learning also provide a new way to detect depressed users. The depression tendency of Chinese students was analyzed by machine learning method, and the depression tendency was detected by the features of voice fragments. First, features are extracted from speech fragments. Then in order to process the extracted features, we used Bidirectional Long and Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Thirdly, the features related to depression will be selected through the attention mechanism. Finally, depressive tendencies prediction is accomplished using the Full Connection (FC) layer. The results of our database designed on the trends of depression students show that our method has achieved a recognition rate of 71.27%, which indicates the effectiveness of this method.",10.1109/ICAIE56796.2023.00018,0,Scopus,85163204122,2-s2.0-85163204122,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163204122

The relationship between loneliness and depression among college students: Mining data derived from passive sensing,Qirtas M.M.,2023,Digital Health,"Background: While there is recognition of the relationship between loneliness and depression, specific behavioural patterns distinguishing both are still not well understood. Objectives: Our objective is to identify distinct behavioural patterns of loneliness and depression from a passively collected dataset of college students, understand their similarities and interrelationships and assess their effectiveness in identifying loneliness and depression. Methods: Utilizing the StudentLife dataset, we applied regression analysis to determine associations with self-reported loneliness and depression. Mediation analysis interprets the relationship between the two conditions, and machine learning models predict loneliness and depression based on behavioural indicators. Results: Distinct behavioural patterns emerged: high evening screen time (OR = 1.45, p = 0.002) and high overall phone usage (OR = 1.50, p = 0.003) were associated with more loneliness, whereas depression was significantly associated with fewer screen unlocks (OR = 0.75, p = 0.044) and visits to fewer unique places (OR = 0.85, p = 0.023). Longer durations of physical activity (OR = 0.72, p = 0.014) and sleep (OR = 0.46, p = 0.002) are linked to a lower risk of both loneliness and depression. Mediation analysis revealed that loneliness significantly increases the likelihood of depression by 48%. The prediction accuracy of our XGBoost-based machine learning approach was 82.43% for loneliness and 79.43% for depression. Conclusion: Our findings show that high evening screen time and overall phone usage are significantly associated with increased loneliness, while fewer screen unlocks and visits to fewer unique places are significantly related to depression. The findings can help in developing targeted interventions to promote well-being and mental health in students.",10.1177/20552076231211104,14,Scopus,85176428258,2-s2.0-85176428258,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176428258

A practical approach to identifying autistic adults within the electronic health record,Malow B.A.,2023,Autism Research,"The electronic health record (EHR) provides valuable data for understanding physical and mental health conditions in autism. We developed an approach to identify charts of autistic young adults, retrieved from our institution's de-identified EHR database. Clinical notes within two cohorts were identified. Cohort 1 charts had at least one International Classification of Diseases (ICD-CM) autism code. Cohort 2 charts had only autism key terms without ICD-CM codes, and at least four notes per chart. A natural language processing tool parsed medical charts to identify key terms associated with autism diagnoses and mapped them to Unified Medical Language System Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). Average scores were calculated for each set of charts based on captured CUIs. Chart review determined whether patients met criteria for autism using a classification rubric. In Cohort 1, of 418 patients, 361 were confirmed to have autism by chart review. Sensitivity was 0.99 and specificity was 0.68 with positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.97. Specificity improved to 0.81 (sensitivity was 0.95; PPV was 0.98) when the number of notes was limited to four or more per chart. In Cohort 2, 48 of 136 patients were confirmed to have autism by chart review. Sensitivity was 0.95, specificity was 0.73, and PPV was 0.70. Our approach, which included using key terms, identified autism charts with high sensitivity, even in the absence of ICD-CM codes. Relying on ICD-CM codes alone may result in inclusion of false positive cases and exclusion of true cases with autism.",10.1002/aur.2849,0,Scopus,85142168801,2-s2.0-85142168801,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142168801
Monintoring Student Depression by Mobile Devices with Autoencoder Networks,Ge X.,2023,2023 3rd International Conference on Neural Networks Information and Communication Engineering Nnice 2023,"The timely assessment of mental health is difficult since we lack the objective measurements of symptoms, especially for the Covid-19 pandemic quarantined students. Fortunately, smart phones can capture the real-world data such as the GPS traces and the phone active time et.al that link the behavioral patterns to the mental health. However, recent studies are based on a very small size of participants and only collect fewer phone features, which means that the effective predicting models which require various features are hardly adopted. In this paper, we develop an android application to record multidimensional data of users as well as a PHQ-9 and a SAS questionary, and we distribute it to 176 college students to collect larger scale data when in quarantine period. To address the unprecise problem of handcrafted feature extraction, we design an autoencoder machine learning model to monitor the student mental health. Extensive experiments indicate that the performance of the proposed method improves its F-1 score for PHQ-9 and SAS by 5% and 6% to the state of the current studies, respectively.",10.1109/NNICE58320.2023.10105715,0,Scopus,85158950330,2-s2.0-85158950330,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158950330

College Students’ Perception and Concerns regarding Online Examination amid COVID-19,Lee H.J.J.,2023,International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering and Information Technology,"Growing concerns about online examinations have led to various investigations of techniques for improvement. With most higher education institutions shifting to online learning and examination amid COVID-19, these concerns, including the academic dishonesty, validity, reliability, and anxiety of online examination, are more critical than ever. This paper presents the outcomes of the survey to elicit the perceptions of undergraduate students from two universities in South Korea and Malaysia towards undertaking online exams and the associated concerns. Additionally, the study explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these concerns. There are three main research questions: 1) How has AI been adopted to tackle the four main concerns in online exams? 2) What are the students’ perceptions regarding these concerns? Are there any differences between South Korean and Malaysian students? 3) What is the extent of the stress level when webcam proctoring and timers are implemented during online exams? The survey results show that both South Korean and Malaysian students agree that online exams make cheating more accessible than inperson exams. They also suggest that selecting questions randomly from a question bank could discourage cheating. Moreover, the study highlights that both groups of students experience moderate stress levels when webcam proctoring is used over Zoom during online exams, and they experience a high-stress level when timers are set for each question.",10.18517/ijaseit.13.4.18588,0,Scopus,85170693984,2-s2.0-85170693984,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170693984
"Determinants of Intentions to Use Digital Mental Healthcare Content among University Students, Faculty, and Staff: Motivation, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Parasocial Interaction with AI Chatbot",Park D.Y.,2023,Sustainability Switzerland,"Depression is a worldwide health issue to which various physical, psychological, and social health problems are attributable. To address the issue through the promotion of digital mental healthcare content use, this study examines factors influencing people’s intentions to use the content, guided by the technology acceptance model and uses and gratifications theory. A total of 278 students and faculty/staff members at a Korean university tried using a digital mental healthcare content (e.g., artificial intelligence chatbot content) called MyMentalPocket and completed a survey questionnaire associated with their perceptions of the content. Participants’ depression levels, perceived usefulness, and parasocial interactions emerged as significant and positive factors influencing people’s intentions to use MyMentalPocket. Female gender, younger age, and specific motives for depression-related digital technology use (i.e., communication and emotional support, information- and guidance-seeking, and habitual entertainment-seeking motives) emerged as significant and positive factors influencing parasocial interactions. Parasocial interactions and perceived ease of use emerged as significant and positive factors influencing perceived usefulness. The findings from this study imply the utility of AI chatbots as a way to help people, especially females and younger people with depression and interpersonal difficulties, to utilize and benefit from digital mental healthcare content for depression management.",10.3390/su15010872,55,Scopus,85146030208,2-s2.0-85146030208,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146030208

Depression Detection on Twitter Using RNN and LSTM Models,Apoorva A.,2023,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Social media mainly provides an unparalleled chance to detect depression early in young adults. Depression is an illness that so often requires the self-reporting of symptoms. Social networking sites can provide an ample amount of data and information to train an efficient deep learning model. We aim to perform depression analysis on Twitter by analyzing its linguistic markers, making it plausible to create a deep learning model capable of providing an individual discernment into their mental health much earlier than the traditional approaches. We use two models to detect depressive users using their tweets on this conquest, a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). The LSTM model outperforms simple RNN by having a validation accuracy of 96.21 and a validation loss of 0.1077. Both models were trained on a single customized dataset, half of which was from sentiment140, and the other half was extracted from Twitter using the Twitter API.",10.1007/978-3-031-28183-9_22,4,Scopus,85151297120,2-s2.0-85151297120,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151297120
Wearable Artificial Intelligence for Anxiety and Depression: Scoping Review,Abd-Alrazaq A.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Anxiety and depression are the most common mental disorders worldwide. Owing to the lack of psychiatrists around the world, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into wearable devices (wearable AI) has been exploited to provide mental health services. Objective: This review aimed to explore the features of wearable AI used for anxiety and depression to identify application areas and open research issues. Methods: We searched 8 electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar) and included studies that met the inclusion criteria. Then, we checked the studies that cited the included studies and screened studies that were cited by the included studies. The study selection and data extraction were carried out by 2 reviewers independently. The extracted data were aggregated and summarized using narrative synthesis. Results: Of the 1203 studies identified, 69 (5.74%) were included in this review. Approximately, two-thirds of the studies used wearable AI for depression, whereas the remaining studies used it for anxiety. The most frequent application of wearable AI was in diagnosing anxiety and depression; however, none of the studies used it for treatment purposes. Most studies targeted individuals aged between 18 and 65 years. The most common wearable device used in the studies was Actiwatch AW4 (Cambridge Neurotechnology Ltd). Wrist-worn devices were the most common type of wearable device in the studies. The most commonly used category of data for model development was physical activity data, followed by sleep data and heart rate data. The most frequently used data set from open sources was Depresjon. The most commonly used algorithm was random forest, followed by support vector machine. Conclusions: Wearable AI can offer great promise in providing mental health services related to anxiety and depression. Wearable AI can be used by individuals for the prescreening assessment of anxiety and depression. Further reviews are needed to statistically synthesize the studies’ results related to the performance and effectiveness of wearable AI. Given its potential, technology companies should invest more in wearable AI for the treatment of anxiety and depression.",10.2196/42672,67,Scopus,85147044713,2-s2.0-85147044713,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147044713
Underbagging-Based Ensemble Learning approach to Detection of Depression from Smartphone Logs,Sakaguchi K.,2023,Gcce 2023 2023 IEEE 12th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics,"Depression requires early diagnosis and appropriate treatment at psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. However many patients hesitate to receive a treatment because of resistance to medical institutions. Healthcare support systems have been developed to detect depression from lifelog data and encourage medical consultation. In this paper, we propose a model to detect depression based on a dataset containing smartphone logs and answers to questionnaires. We analyze 14 days of dataset from 38 university students and discriminate whether the user is depressed or not by a daily smartphone log. We propose a underbagging-based depression detection model using ensemble learning combined with undersampling. We confirmed that our method can detect depression with sensivity of 0.84 and g-mean of 0.70.",10.1109/GCCE59613.2023.10315432,1,Scopus,85179752952,2-s2.0-85179752952,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179752952

Hygienic Aspects of Adaptation to Distance Learning in High School Children and Students of Both Sexes,Shubochkina E.I.,2023,Public Health and Life Environment,"Introduction: Digitalization of education, which has been widely implemented in Russia since 2015, has made it possible to provide distance learning for schoolchildren and students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of assessing indicators of the functional state of schoolchildren and students in this mode of education showed the possibility of such negative consequences as increased fatigue, complaints related to the musculoskeletal system, pronounced manifestations of computer vision syndrome and stress. Objective: To assess age and sex-specific patterns of adaptation of high school children, students of vocational schools and universities to distance learning. Materials and methods: We conducted an anonymous online survey of high school children in the cities of Moscow and Omsk (n = 91) and students of a college and a university in Omsk (56 and 43 young people, respectively) using a specially developed questionnaire containing 36 questions about health status and well-being after online classes and finishing homework, duration of leisure-time Internet use, and lifestyle. We evaluated indicators of well-being, complaints of fatigue, headaches, irritability, pain associated with the musculoskeletal system, manifestations of computer vision syndrome, other complaints occurring during e-learning and doing homework. The analysis of data on 190 subjects was carried out using online calculators for estimating statistical criteria using generally accepted statistical methods. The results of descriptive statistics were presented as arithmetic means (M) and their standard errors (±m). We used the Student’s and Fischer’s criteria and estimated values of relative health risks (RR), their confidence intervals and the etiological fraction (EF, %). Results: We found that distance learning increased the prevalence of complaints of fatigue, headaches, irritability, neck and back pain after online classes and especially homework. We established sex-specific differences in health effects of the total academic load. Young women were more vulnerable than young men. In schoolgirls, risks of headaches after online classes were statistically significant compared to those after homework (RR = 3.4; 95 % CI = 1.37–8.45) with a very high degree of correlation (EF = 70.6 %). Irritability after classes was also more frequent in girls. Female vocational school students had higher rates of severe fatigue after classes compared to male students (RR = 2.77; 95 % CI = 1.07–7.16). They were also more likely to complain of pain in the right wrist. Female university students had even more pronounced sex-specific differences in vulnerability compared to their male peers in terms of fatigue after school and homework, pain in neck (RR = 8.05; 95 % CI = 1.24–52.4) and back (RR = 3.83; 95 % CI = 1.22–12.1) after finishing homework. We observed that leisure and lifestyle of all the students were characterized by excess use of the Internet, reduced sleep duration, and low physical activity. Conclusions: There are significant differences in the lifestyle and reactions of girls and boys to the academic load in the course of distance learning. Our findings show that e-learning can negatively affect students’ well-being, contributing to complaints typical of computer visual syndrome and disorders of the musculoskeletal system. We have obtained evidence proving the necessity to regulate the total load of digital education in order to attenuate its adverse health effects in modern adolescents and young people, especially females.",10.35627/2219-5238/2023-31-8-57-64,1,Scopus,85184611109,2-s2.0-85184611109,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184611109

Will AI make us crazy?,Stover D.,2023,Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,"Chatbots and other artificial-intelligence applications that mimic human conversation or writing have rapidly become some of the most popular tech applications of all time. Expert analysis and media coverage of the risks and benefits of AI have paid scant attention to how chatbots might affect public health at a time when depression, suicide, anxiety, and mental illness are epidemic in the United States, particularly among children and young adults. Many experts have pointed to a correlation between declining mental health and increasing online engagement. Generative AI’s potential to transform education, the job market, and social interactions could come at the expense of humanity’s own mental faculties, creativity, and social skills. Chatbots—which are prone to errors and fabrications—could also make it more difficult for humans to tell fact from fiction. But to the extent that mental health experts and the healthcare industry are interested in AI, it’s mostly viewed as a promising tool for identifying and treating mental health issues, rather than a potential threat to mental health.",10.1080/00963402.2023.2245247,1,Scopus,85176043697,2-s2.0-85176043697,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176043697
Examination of the Relationship Between Smartphone Dependency and Driving Behaviour in Young Drivers: Preliminary Analysis,Chen W.S.,2023,International Conference on Vehicle Technology and Intelligent Transport Systems Vehits Proceedings,"The smartphone has emerged as one of the important necessities in our daily lives. However, smartphone dependency can have negative as well as positive impacts on our overall well-being. Young adults are likely to demonstrate particularly problematic dependency on smartphone use. This is also the age group with a disproportionate contribution to road deaths in Australia (approximately 25% for 17-25 year olds), for reasons such as lack of experience and road awareness, resulting in bad choices or poor assessment of a road situation. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between smartphone dependency and driving behaviour in young people provided with the basic (control group) and extended (intervention group) features of an in-car telematics device. Participants aged between 18-30 were invited to complete the self-reported questionnaires, and an in-car telematics device with basic features was then activated over a 30-day period in their vehicles. At the start of the second 30-day period, half of the participants had their telematics installation extended. A linear mixed model analysis was conducted to allow for the hierarchical structure of the telematics data, with trips nested within drivers. The results suggest that in-car telematics devices can be adopted to improve the driving behaviour of young drivers.",10.5220/0012028500003479,2,Scopus,85160724105,2-s2.0-85160724105,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160724105

Systemic Corticosteroids in Patients With Bronchial Asthma: A Real-Life Study,Izquierdo J.L.,2023,Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology,"Objective: The objective of the present study was to determine the use of systemic corticosteroids (SCs) in patients with bronchial asthma using big data analysis. Methods: We performed an observational, retrospective, noninterventional study based on secondary data captured from free text in the electronic health records. This study was performed based on data from the regional health service of Castille-La Mancha (SESCAM), Spain. We performed the analysis using big data and artificial intelligence via Savana® Manager version 3.0. Results: During the study period, 103 667 patients were diagnosed with and treated for asthma at different care levels. The search was restricted to patients aged 10 to 90 years (mean age, 43.5 [95%CI, 43.4-43.7] years). Of these, 59.8% were women. SCs were taken for treatment of asthma by 58 745 patients at some point during the study period. These patients were older, with a higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, depression, and hiatus hernia. SCs are used frequently in the general population with asthma (31.4% in 2015 and 39.6% in 2019). SCs were prescribed mainly in primary care (59%), allergy (13%), and pulmonology (20%). The frequency of prescription of SCs had a direct impact on the main associated adverse effects. Conclusion: In clinical practice, SCs are frequently prescribed to patients with asthma, especially in primary care. Use of SCs is associated with a greater number of adverse events. It is necessary to implement measures to reduce prescription of SCs to patients with asthma, especially in primary care.",10.18176/jiaci.0765,12,Scopus,85136726709,2-s2.0-85136726709,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136726709

Emotional Distress During COVID-19 by Mental Health Conditions and Economic Vulnerability: Retrospective Analysis of Survey-Linked Twitter Data With a Semisupervised Machine Learning Algorithm,Ueda M.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Monitoring the psychological conditions of social media users during rapidly developing public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, using their posts on social media has rapidly gained popularity as a relatively easy and cost-effective method. However, the characteristics of individuals who created these posts are largely unknown, making it difficult to identify groups of individuals most affected by such crises. In addition, large annotated data sets for mental health conditions are not easily available, and thus, supervised machine learning algorithms can be infeasible or too costly. Objective: This study proposes a machine learning framework for the real-time surveillance of mental health conditions that does not require extensive training data. Using survey-linked tweets, we tracked the level of emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic by the attributes and psychological conditions of social media users in Japan. Methods: We conducted online surveys of adults residing in Japan in May 2022 and collected their basic demographic information, socioeconomic status, and mental health conditions, along with their Twitter handles (N=2432). We computed emotional distress scores for all the tweets posted by the study participants between January 1, 2019, and May 30, 2022 (N=2,493,682) using a semisupervised algorithm called latent semantic scaling (LSS), with higher values indicating higher levels of emotional distress. After excluding users by age and other criteria, we examined 495,021 (19.85%) tweets generated by 560 (23.03%) individuals (age 18-49 years) in 2019 and 2020. We estimated fixed-effect regression models to examine their emotional distress levels in 2020 relative to the corresponding weeks in 2019 by the mental health conditions and characteristics of social media users. Results: The estimated level of emotional distress of our study participants increased in the week when school closure started (March 2020), and it peaked at the beginning of the state of emergency (estimated coefficient=0.219, 95% CI 0.162-0.276) in early April 2020. Their level of emotional distress was unrelated to the number of COVID-19 cases. We found that the government-induced restrictions disproportionately affected the psychological conditions of vulnerable individuals, including those with low income, precarious employment, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: This study establishes a framework to implement near-real-time monitoring of the emotional distress level of social media users, highlighting a great potential to continuously monitor their well-being using survey-linked social media posts as a complement to administrative and large-scale survey data. Given its flexibility and adaptability, the proposed framework is easily extendable for other purposes, such as detecting suicidality among social media users, and can be used on streaming data for continuous measurement of the conditions and sentiment of any group of interest.",10.2196/44965,8,Scopus,85150396488,2-s2.0-85150396488,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150396488
Using Machine Learning to Forecast the Risk of Suicide Attempts over Time,Shetty M S.,2023,Proceedings 2023 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Information Security and Communication Applications Ciisca 2023,"Suicide is recognized as a grave public health concern affecting individuals of all ages, from children and adolescents to young adults and beyond. It represents a significant cause of mortality within this population, influenced by various factors. Conventional methods for predicting suicide attempts have restricted the accuracy and scope of detecting these perilous behaviors. To enhance the accuracy and scope of detecting suicide attempts, we utilized machine learning on electronic health records from a vast medical database. Our study involved 469 adults exhibiting suicidal tendencies, among whom 85 patients made suicide attempts (cases). Additionally, 384 participants who did not attempt suicide but had depression showed promising signs of suicidal behavior, as confirmed by expert record review. This approach surpasses the limitations of traditional methods in predicting suicide attempts. Through the development of machine learning algorithms, we achieved accurate predictions of future suicide attempts (AUC = 0.80, precision= 0.30, recall = 0.54, Fl-score = 0.32, support=13). Our findings are a significant stride towards precise and scalable detection of suicide risk. Additionally, they offer valuable insights into how the risk of suicide attempts fluctuates over time.",10.1109/CIISCA59740.2023.00064,0,Scopus,85185224554,2-s2.0-85185224554,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185224554
Qualitative analysis of mental health conversational agents messages about autism spectrum disorder: a call for action,Aghakhani S.,2023,Frontiers in Digital Health,"Background: Conversational agents (CA's) have shown promise in increasing accessibility to mental health resources. This study aimed to identify common themes of messages sent to a mental health CA (Wysa) related to ASD by general users and users that identify as having ASD. Methods: This study utilized retrospective data. Two thematic analyses were conducted, one focusing on user messages including the keywords (e.g., ASD, autism, Asperger), and the second one with messages from users who self-identified as having ASD. Results: For the sample of general users, the most frequent themes were “others having ASD,” “ASD diagnosis,” and “seeking help.” For the users that self-identified as having ASD (n = 277), the most frequent themes were “ASD diagnosis or symptoms,” “negative reaction from others,” and “positive comments.” There were 3,725 emotion words mentioned by users who self-identified as having ASD. The majority had negative valence (80.3%), and few were positive (14.8%) or ambivalent (4.9%). Conclusion: Users shared their experiences and emotions surrounding ASD with a mental health CA. Users asked about the ASD diagnosis, sought help, and reported negative reactions from others. CA's have the potential to become a source of support for those interested in ASD and/or identify as having ASD.",10.3389/fdgth.2023.1251016,5,Scopus,85180131501,2-s2.0-85180131501,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180131501
Objective Prediction of Next-Day’s Affect Using Multimodal Physiological and Behavioral Data: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,Jafarlou S.,2023,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Affective states are important aspects of healthy functioning; as such, monitoring and understanding affect is necessary for the assessment and treatment of mood-based disorders. Recent advancements in wearable technologies have increased the use of such tools in detecting and accurately estimating mental states (eg, affect, mood, and stress), offering comprehensive and continuous monitoring of individuals over time. Objective: Previous attempts to model an individual’s mental state relied on subjective measurements or the inclusion of only a few objective monitoring modalities (eg, smartphones). This study aims to investigate the capacity of monitoring affect using fully objective measurements. We conducted a comparatively long-term (12-month) study with a holistic sampling of participants’ moods, including 20 affective states. Methods: Longitudinal physiological data (eg, sleep and heart rate), as well as daily assessments of affect, were collected using 3 modalities (ie, smartphone, watch, and ring) from 20 college students over a year. We examined the difference between the distributions of data collected from each modality along with the differences between their rates of missingness. Out of the 20 participants, 7 provided us with 200 or more days’ worth of data, and we used this for our predictive modeling setup. Distributions of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) among the 7 selected participants were observed. For predictive modeling, we assessed the performance of different machine learning models, including random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). We also investigated the capability of each modality in predicting mood and the most important features of PA and NA RF models. Results: RF was the best-performing model in our analysis and performed mood and stress (nervousness) prediction with ~81% and ~72% accuracy, respectively. PA models resulted in better performance compared to NA. The order of the most important modalities in predicting PA and NA was the smart ring, phone, and watch, respectively. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis showed that sleep and activity-related features were the most impactful in predicting PA and NA. Conclusions: Generic machine learning–based affect prediction models, trained with population data, outperform existing methods, which use the individual’s historical information. Our findings indicated that our mood prediction method outperformed the existing methods. Additionally, we found that sleep and activity level were the most important features for predicting next-day PA and NA, respectively.",10.2196/39425,17,Scopus,85151377120,2-s2.0-85151377120,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151377120
A Multilingual Digital Mental Health and Well-Being Chatbot (ChatPal): Pre-Post Multicenter Intervention Study,Potts C.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: In recent years, advances in technology have led to an influx of mental health apps, in particular the development of mental health and well-being chatbots, which have already shown promise in terms of their efficacy, availability, and accessibility. The ChatPal chatbot was developed to promote positive mental well-being among citizens living in rural areas. ChatPal is a multilingual chatbot, available in English, Scottish Gaelic, Swedish, and Finnish, containing psychoeducational content and exercises such as mindfulness and breathing, mood logging, gratitude, and thought diaries. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a multilingual mental health and well-being chatbot (ChatPal) to establish if it has an effect on mental well-being. Secondary objectives include investigating the characteristics of individuals that showed improvements in well-being along with those with worsening well-being and applying thematic analysis to user feedback. Methods: A pre-post intervention study was conducted where participants were recruited to use the intervention (ChatPal) for a 12-week period. Recruitment took place across 5 regions: Northern Ireland, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, and Finland. Outcome measures included the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale, which were evaluated at baseline, midpoint, and end point. Written feedback was collected from participants and subjected to qualitative analysis to identify themes. Results: A total of 348 people were recruited to the study (n=254, 73% female; n=94, 27% male) aged between 18 and 73 (mean 30) years. The well-being scores of participants improved from baseline to midpoint and from baseline to end point; however, improvement in scores was not statistically significant on the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (P=.42), the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (P=.52), or the Satisfaction With Life Scale (P=.81). Individuals that had improved well-being scores (n=16) interacted more with the chatbot and were significantly younger compared to those whose well-being declined over the study (P=.03). Three themes were identified from user feedback, including “positive experiences,” “mixed or neutral experiences,” and “negative experiences.” Positive experiences included enjoying exercises provided by the chatbot, while most of the mixed, neutral, or negative experiences mentioned liking the chatbot overall, but there were some barriers, such as technical or performance errors, that needed to be overcome. Conclusions: Marginal improvements in mental well-being were seen in those who used ChatPal, albeit nonsignificant. We propose that the chatbot could be used along with other service offerings to complement different digital or face-to-face services, although further research should be carried out to confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Nonetheless, this paper highlights the need for blended service offerings in mental health care.",10.2196/43051,36,Scopus,85164273093,2-s2.0-85164273093,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164273093
Risk of suicide attempts and self-harm after 1.4 million general medical hospitalizations of men with mental illness,Thiruvalluru R.K.,2023,Journal of Psychiatric Research,"Background: The short-term risk of suicide after medical hospital discharge is four times higher among men compared with women. As previous work has identified female-specific antecedents of suicide-related behavior after medical hospitalization of women with serious mental illness, we examined predictors among a similar population of men with multimorbidity. Methods: Classification and regression tree (CART) models were developed and validated using electronic health records (EHRs) from 1,423,161 medical (non-psychiatric) hospitalizations of men ≥ 18-years-old with an existing diagnosis of a depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or chronic psychosis. Hospitalizations occurred between 2009 and 2017. Risk groups were evaluated using an independent testing set. The primary outcome was readmission within one year associated with ICD-9 or -10 code for self-harm or attempt. Results: The 1-year readmission rate for intentional self-harm and suicide attempt was 3.9% (55,337/1,423,161 hospitalizations). The classification model discriminated risk with area under the curve (AUC) 0.73 (Confidence Interval [95%CI] 0.68–0.74), accuracy 0.82 (95%CI 0.71–0.83), sensitivity 82.6% (95%CI 81.2–84), and specificity 83.1% (95%CI 81.7–84.5). Strongest predictors were medical comorbidity, prior self-harm, age, and prior hospitalization. Men with greater medical comorbidity burden and prior self-harm were at highest risk (Odds Ratio [OR] 3.10, 95%CI 3.02–3.18), as were men < 62-years-old with few medical comorbidities (OR 1.11 95%CI 1.08–1.13). Limitations: The study focused on medical hospitalizations for suicide attempt and thus captured only severe attempts resulting in hospitalization. Conclusions: After medical hospitalization, men with serious mental illness experienced a high risk of self-harm (1:25 hospitalizations). Risk was particularly elevated among younger patients without prior medical conditions and older patients with medical comorbidity and prior self-harm.",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.10.035,4,Scopus,85142731737,2-s2.0-85142731737,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142731737
Usability and Credibility of a COVID-19 Vaccine Chatbot for Young Adults and Health Workers in the United States: Formative Mixed Methods Study,Weeks R.,2023,Jmir Human Factors,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic raised novel challenges in communicating reliable, continually changing health information to a broad and sometimes skeptical public, particularly around COVID-19 vaccines, which, despite being comprehensively studied, were the subject of viral misinformation. Chatbots are a promising technology to reach and engage populations during the pandemic. To inform and communicate effectively with users, chatbots must be highly usable and credible. Objective: We sought to understand how young adults and health workers in the United States assessed the usability and credibility of a web-based chatbot called Vira, created by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and IBM Research using natural language processing technology. Using a mixed method approach, we sought to rapidly improve Vira’s user experience to support vaccine decision-making during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We recruited racially and ethnically diverse young people and health workers, with both groups from urban areas of the United States. We used the validated Chatbot Usability Questionnaire to understand the tool’s navigation, precision, and persona. We also conducted 11 interviews with health workers and young people to understand the user experience, whether they perceived the chatbot as confidential and trustworthy, and how they would use the chatbot. We coded and categorized emerging themes to understand the determining factors for participants’ assessment of chatbot usability and credibility. Results: In all, 58 participants completed a web-based usability questionnaire and 11 completed in-depth interviews. Most questionnaire respondents said the chatbot was “easy to navigate” (51/58, 88%) and “very easy to use” (50/58, 86%), and many (45/58, 78%) said its responses were relevant. The mean Chatbot Usability Questionnaire score was 70.2 (SD 12.1) and scores ranged from 40.6 to 95.3. Interview participants felt the chatbot achieved high usability due to its strong functionality, performance, and perceived confidentiality and that the chatbot could attain high credibility with a redesign of its cartoonish visual persona. Young people said they would use the chatbot to discuss vaccination with hesitant friends or family members, whereas health workers used or anticipated using the chatbot to support community outreach, save time, and stay up to date. Conclusions: This formative study conducted during the pandemic’s peak provided user feedback for an iterative redesign of Vira. Using a mixed method approach provided multidimensional feedback, identifying how the chatbot worked well—being easy to use, answering questions appropriately, and using credible branding—while offering tangible steps to improve the product’s visual design. Future studies should evaluate how chatbots support personal health decision-making, particularly in the context of a public health emergency, and whether such outreach tools can reduce staff burnout. Randomized studies should also be conducted to measure how chatbots countering health misinformation affect user knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.",10.2196/40533,19,Scopus,85149883396,2-s2.0-85149883396,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149883396
Smartphone-Tracked Digital Markers of Momentary Subjective Stress in College Students: Idiographic Machine Learning Analysis,Aalbers G.,2023,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Stress is an important predictor of mental health problems such as burnout and depression. Acute stress is considered adaptive, whereas chronic stress is viewed as detrimental to well-being. To aid in the early detection of chronic stress, machine learning models are increasingly trained to learn the quantitative relation from digital footprints to self-reported stress. Prior studies have investigated general principles in population-wide studies, but the extent to which the findings apply to individuals is understudied. Objective: We aimed to explore to what extent machine learning models can leverage features of smartphone app use log data to recognize momentary subjective stress in individuals, which of these features are most important for predicting stress and represent potential digital markers of stress, the nature of the relations between these digital markers and stress, and the degree to which these relations differ across people. Methods: Student participants (N=224) self-reported momentary subjective stress 5 times per day up to 60 days in total (44,381 observations); in parallel, dedicated smartphone software continuously logged their smartphone app use. We extracted features from the log data (eg, time spent on app categories such as messenger apps and proxies for sleep duration and onset) and trained machine learning models to predict momentary subjective stress from these features using 2 approaches: modeling general relations at the group level (nomothetic approach) and modeling relations for each person separately (idiographic approach). To identify potential digital markers of momentary subjective stress, we applied explainable artificial intelligence methodology (ie, Shapley additive explanations). We evaluated model accuracy on a person-to-person basis in out-of-sample observations. Results: We identified prolonged use of messenger and social network site apps and proxies for sleep duration and onset as the most important features across modeling approaches (nomothetic vs idiographic). The relations of these digital markers with momentary subjective stress differed from person to person, as did model accuracy. Sleep proxies, messenger, and social network use were heterogeneously related to stress (ie, negative in some and positive or zero in others). Model predictions correlated positively and statistically significantly with self-reported stress in most individuals (median person-specific correlation=0.15-0.19 for nomothetic models and median person-specific correlation=0.00-0.09 for idiographic models). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that smartphone log data can be used for identifying digital markers of stress and also show that the relation between specific digital markers and stress differs from person to person. These findings warrant follow-up studies in other populations (eg, professionals and clinical populations) and pave the way for similar research using physiological measures of stress.",10.2196/37469,21,Scopus,85151043226,2-s2.0-85151043226,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151043226

Machine Learning for Mental Health: A Systematic Study of Seven Approaches for Detecting Mental Disorders,Nadeem M.,2023,2023 International Technical Conference on Circuits Systems Computers and Communications Itc Cscc 2023,"Mental disorders are a prevalent issue among teenagers. The widespread use of smartphones and social media has revolutionized the way individuals communicate and exchange information with millions of people using these technologies every day. As a result, vast amounts of data are generated, which can be harnessed to improve mental health detection. The increasing prevalence of mental health issues and the demand for quality healthcare services have led to research exploring the potential of machine learning (ML) to address these challenges. This paper provides a systematic study of seven ML approaches used in previous studies to detect mental disorders. The study examines the datasets employed, the accuracy achieved, and the limitations of each ML approach. The seven ML approaches studied in this paper are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These approaches have been utilized in various studies to detect mental disorders and this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of their effectiveness. The findings indicate that machine learning approaches have demonstrated significant potential for the detection of mental disorders, with promising implications for enhancing healthcare services. Additionally, the paper discusses the open research challenges and future directions for mental health.",10.1109/ITC-CSCC58803.2023.10212609,3,Scopus,85169794235,2-s2.0-85169794235,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169794235
Relationship Between Pain and LGBT Status Among Veterans in Care in a Retrospective Cross-Sectional Cohort,Gordon K.S.,2023,Journal of Pain Research,"Background: Pain assessment is performed in many healthcare systems, such as the Veterans Health Administration, but prior studies have not assessed whether pain screening varies in sexual and gender minority populations that include individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or transgender (LGBT). Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate pain screening and reported pain of LGBT Veterans compared to non-LGBT Veterans. Methods: Using a retrospective cross-sectional cohort, data from the Corporate Data Warehouse, a national repository with clinical/ administrative data, were analyzed. Veterans were classified as LGBT using natural language processing. We used a robust Poisson model to examine the association between LGBT status and binary outcomes of pain screening, any pain, and persistent pain within one year of entry in the cohort. All models were adjusted for demographics, mental health, substance use, musculoskeletal disorder(s), and number of clinic visits. Results: There were 1,149,486 Veterans (218,154 (19%) classified as LGBT) in our study. Among LGBT Veterans, 94% were screened for pain compared to 89% among those not classified as LGBT (non-LGBT) Veterans. In adjusted models, LGBT Veterans’ probability of being screened for pain compared to non-LGBT Veterans was 2.5% higher (95% CI 2.3%, 2.6%); risk of any pain was 2.1% lower (95% CI 1.6%, 2.6%); and there was no significant difference between LGBT and non-LGBT Veterans in persistent pain (RR = 1.00, 95% CI (0.99, 1.01), p = 0.88). Conclusions: In a nationwide sample, LGBT Veterans were more likely to be screened for pain but had lower self-reported pain scores, though adjusted differences were small. It was notable that transgender and Black Veterans reported the greatest pain. Reasons for these findings require further investigation.",10.2147/JPR.S432967,0,Scopus,85178493774,2-s2.0-85178493774,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178493774
"Association of Smartphone Use and Digital Addiction with Mental Health, Quality of Life, Motivation and Learning of Medical Students: A Two-Year Follow-Up Study",Machado de Oliveira M.,2023,Psychiatry New York,"Background: Despite studies evaluating the insertion of technology and the use of smartphones in the mental health and learning of medical students, few have investigated these outcomes longitudinally. This study aims to investigate the association between smartphone use and digital addiction with mental health, quality of life, learning, and academic motivation of medical students. Methods: This is a longitudinal study conducted between 2016 and 2018. Socio-demographics, smartphone use, digital dependence (Internet Addiction Test), surface and deep learning approach (Biggs), motivation (Academic Motivation Scale), evaluation of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS- 21) and Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) were assessed. Adjusted regression models were used for data analysis. Results: A total of 269 students were included(51.4% of the total). In the two-year follow-up, despite an increase in the frequency of smartphone use in general and also in the classroom for non-educational activities, no increase in digital dependence was found. In the adjusted models, the frequency of smartphone use and digital dependence were predictors of lower academic motivation and greater surface learning after two years of follow up. However, only digital dependence was a predictor of worse mental health (anxiety, depression, and stress) and worse quality of life. Conclusion: Greater use of smartphones and high addiction scores were associated with worse educational outcomes. Digital dependence was another marker of outcomes in mental health and quality of life. It is important that educators are aware of these negative effects and can guide students on the proper and safe use of these devices.",10.1080/00332747.2022.2161258,9,Scopus,85166741231,2-s2.0-85166741231,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166741231
Mental Health Analysis using Deep Learning of Social Media Data gathered using Chrome Extension,Joshi M.,2023,2023 4th International Conference for Emerging Technology Incet 2023,"Recently the topic of 'mental health' has gained high awareness, especially among younger generations. The age group that mostly gets affected by mental disorders is between 15-49 years of age. Research conducted on different social media data has found that a person with mental disorders (such as depression, anxiety, etc) tends to use social media more as compared to a mentally healthy person. Most users convey their emotional states through posting on public platforms, tweeting and accordingly watching related videos on YouTube that best describes their current mental state. It is also found that there is a difference in users' social media activities (on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) with a healthy mind and one with an unhealthy mind. A study conducted in 2018 found that 45% of teenagers worldwide are constantly using the internet. According to research, teenagers use the internet on average for about nine hours each day. The internet can prove to be the easiest medium to monitor a person's online activities (such as posting on social media, writing emails, watching or liking YouTube videos, commenting on YouTube videos, etc). The aforementioned activities and the internet usage time of a person can help to understand his/her mental state. The user's social media activity can be analysed for finding potential patterns in his emotions/mood. These patterns can be helpful in uncovering underlying mental health issues such as depression, stress disorders, PTSD, schizophrenia etc. These findings can be reported to the user's therapist for their monitoring record. To predict the mental state of the user by analysing their social media activities, an initiative was taken to develop an application with the objective to forewarn its users of any negative patterns regarding the state of mind that they exhibit. This application makes use of the Bidirectional LSTM algorithm, a deep learning method to identify a user's emotions (one among the 6 defined emotions) and stores it for further usage. This application feeds the user's data retrieved by the Chrome extension from 4 sources i.e. Twitter, YouTube, Gmail and Journal, to the trained model and stored the output. This output is displayed in a graphical format as well as in detail to the user. This application can become a personal companion to users by keeping track of their emotions and identifying any decline in their mental state and hence improving their emotional well-being.",10.1109/INCET57972.2023.10170255,2,Scopus,85166369822,2-s2.0-85166369822,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166369822
Digital Counseling for Cases of Resilience in Students Using the LSTM Model,Permana A.A.J.,2023,Proceedings International Conference on Smart Green Technology in Electrical and Information Systems Icsgteis,"Indonesia is moving towards becoming a developed country, so preparing human resources is very important. Especially for mental health. One of them is student resilience in Indonesia. Surveys show that 10-20% of Indonesian teenagers experience mental disorders, as well as the impact of COVID 19. The aim of this research is to determine the level of student resilience. If resistance is low then counseling is immediately carried out. Counseling is inflexible and not private so many students don't do it. This causes counseling not to occur. Apart from school hours being busy with intra and extra curricular activities, students' time to participate is limited. School counselors need to conduct counseling by utilizing technology to make the counselor's work easier. It is necessary to develop a digital counseling model for resilience cases based on deep learning. The method used is long short-term memory (LSTM). In deep learning, it is necessary to set hyper parameter values. In this case, it uses 128 neurons, 2 layers, learning rate 0.001, and epoch 10. This model has been tested and can help counselors identify the level of student resilience with training accuracy of 94% and testing accuracy of 96% with comparison of training and testing data (80% : 20%).",10.1109/ICSGTEIS60500.2023.10424190,1,Scopus,85187556587,2-s2.0-85187556587,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187556587
Comparing the Acceptability and Quality of Intervention Modalities for Suicidality in the Emergency Department: Randomized Feasibility Trial,Larkin C.,2023,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Emergency departments (EDs) manage many patients with suicide risk, but effective interventions for suicidality are challenging to implement in this setting. ReachCare is a technology-facilitated version of an evidence-based intervention for suicidal ED patients. Here, we present findings on the acceptability and quality of ReachCare in the ED, as well as a comparison of these measures across 3 potential delivery modalities Objective: Our aim was to test the feasibility of the ReachCare intervention in its entirety through conducting a pilot study with patients presenting with suicidality to the ED. We tested three different ways of receiving the ED-based components of ReachCare: (1) self-administered on the tablet app using a chatbot interface, (2) administered by an in-person clinician, or (3) administered by a telehealth clinician. Methods: In total, 47 ED patients who screened positive for suicide risk were randomly allocated to receive one of three delivery modalities of ReachCare in the ED: (1) self-administered on the patient-facing tablet app with a chatbot interface, (2) delivered by an in-person clinician, or (3) delivered by a telehealth clinician, with the latter two using a clinician-facing web app. We measured demographic and clinical characteristics, acceptability and appropriateness of the intervention, and quality and completeness of the resulting safety plans. Results: Patients assigned high ratings for the acceptability (median 4.00/5, IQR 4.00-4.50) and appropriateness (median 4.00/5, IQR 4.00-4.25) of ReachCare’s ED components, and there were no substantial differences across the 3 delivery modalities [H(acceptability)=3.90, P=.14; H(appropriateness)=1.05, P=.59]. The self-administered modality took significantly less time than the 2 clinician modalities (H=27.91, P<.001), and the usability of the self-administered version was in the “very high” range (median 93.75/100, IQR 80.00-97.50). The safety plans created across all 3 modalities were high-quality (H=0.60, P=.74). Conclusions: Patients rated ReachCare in the ED as highly acceptable and appropriate regardless of modality. Self-administration may be a feasible way to ensure patients with suicide risk receive an intervention in resource constrained EDs. Limitations include small sample size and demographic differences between those enrolled versus not enrolled. Further research will examine the clinical outcomes of patients receiving both the in-ED and post-ED components of ReachCare.",10.2196/49783,4,Scopus,85178062129,2-s2.0-85178062129,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178062129
"Scope, Characteristics, Behavior Change Techniques, and Quality of Conversational Agents for Mental Health and Well-Being: Systematic Assessment of Apps",Lin X.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Mental disorders cause substantial health-related burden worldwide. Mobile health interventions are increasingly being used to promote mental health and well-being, as they could improve access to treatment and reduce associated costs. Behavior change is an important feature of interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being. There is a need to discern the active components that can promote behavior change in such interventions and ultimately improve users’ mental health. Objective: This study systematically identified mental health conversational agents (CAs) currently available in app stores and assessed the behavior change techniques (BCTs) used. We further described their main features, technical aspects, and quality in terms of engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information using the Mobile Application Rating Scale. Methods: The search, selection, and assessment of apps were adapted from a systematic review methodology and included a search, 2 rounds of selection, and an evaluation following predefined criteria. We conducted a systematic app search of Apple’s App Store and Google Play using 42matters. Apps with CAs in English that uploaded or updated from January 2020 and provided interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being and the assessment or management of mental disorders were tested by at least 2 reviewers. The BCT taxonomy v1, a comprehensive list of 93 BCTs, was used to identify the specific behavior change components in CAs. Results: We found 18 app-based mental health CAs. Most CAs had <1000 user ratings on both app stores (12/18, 67%) and targeted several conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression (13/18, 72%). All CAs addressed >1 mental disorder. Most CAs (14/18, 78%) used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Half (9/18, 50%) of the CAs identified were rule based (ie, only offered predetermined answers) and the other half (9/18, 50%) were artificial intelligence enhanced (ie, included open-ended questions). CAs used 48 different BCTs and included on average 15 (SD 8.77; range 4-30) BCTs. The most common BCTs were 3.3 “Social support (emotional),” 4.1 “Instructions for how to perform a behavior,” 11.2 “Reduce negative emotions,” and 6.1 “Demonstration of the behavior.” One-third (5/14, 36%) of the CAs claiming to be CBT based did not include core CBT concepts. Conclusions: Mental health CAs mostly targeted various mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression, reflecting a broad intervention focus. The most common BCTs identified serve to promote the self-management of mental disorders with few therapeutic elements. CA developers should consider the quality of information, user confidentiality, access, and emergency management when designing mental health CAs. Future research should assess the role of artificial intelligence in promoting behavior change within CAs and determine the choice of BCTs in evidence-based psychotherapies to enable systematic, consistent, and transparent development and evaluation of effective digital mental health interventions.",10.2196/45984,9,Scopus,85165518096,2-s2.0-85165518096,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165518096
Digital Counseling Model with Deep Learning for Mental Health of Vocational School Students,Permana A.A.J.,2023,2023 10th International Conference on Information Technology Computer and Electrical Engineering Icitacee 2023,"Indonesia is preparing to become a developed country in 2045, so it is essential to prepare infrastructure, policies, and human resources. Today's youth will be the spearhead for the next 20 years, so they must be well prepared. Not only smart, intelligent, and spiritually intelligent, but also has a good mentality. Maintaining mental health is very important to produce human resources who are physically and spiritually healthy. Surveys show that 10-20% of Indonesian youth have mental disorders. The causes of this problem can be internal and external, including the Covid pandemic. This research aims to develop a model that can help school counselors detect students' mental health quickly, precisely, and flexibly. The method used is observation, data collection by questionnaire, data analysis, model development, evaluation, testing, and dissemination of research results. This study resulted in a model developed with deep learning artificial intelligence (AI), which can provide information and detect mental health in students. After going through the stages and testing, a testing accuracy of 96% was obtained, which means the model can carry out digital-based counseling to students.

"Psychotherapy, artificial intelligence and adolescents: ethical aspects",Alfano L.,2023,Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly advanced in various domains, including its application in psychotherapy. AI-powered psychotherapy tools present promising solutions for increasing accessibility to mental health care. However, the integration of AI in psychotherapy raises significant ethical concerns that require thorough consideration and regulation to ensure ethical practice, patient safety, and data privacy. This article discusses the ethical considerations surrounding the utilization of AI in psychotherapy, emphasizing the need for responsible implementation, patient privacy, and the human-AI interaction. The challenge raised by the use of artificial intelligence requires a comprehensive approach. Schools, in particular, are crucial in providing both knowledge and ethical guidance, helping young individuals decipher the complexities of online content. Additionally, parental support is essential, requiring the provision of time, fostering relationships, encouraging dialogue, and creating a safe environment to share experiences amidst the intricacies of adolescence. Reimagining social and healthcare services tailored for adolescents is equally crucial, taking into account recent societal changes. The integration of AI in psychotherapy has vast potential to transform mental healthcare. However, ensuring its accuracy and effectiveness demands a proactive approach to address associated ethical considerations. By adopting responsible practices, preserving patient autonomy, and continually refining AI systems, the field can leverage the benefits of AI in psychotherapy while maintaining high ethical standards.",10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2023.64.4.3135,15,Scopus,85184003314,2-s2.0-85184003314,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184003314
Acoustic Analysis of Speech for Screening for Suicide Risk: Machine Learning Classifiers for Between- and Within-Person Evaluation of Suicidality,Min S.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Assessing a patient’s suicide risk is challenging for health professionals because it depends on voluntary disclosure by the patient and often has limited resources. The application of novel machine learning approaches to determine suicide risk has clinical utility. Objective: This study aimed to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches to assess suicidality based on acoustic voice features of psychiatric patients using artificial intelligence. Methods: We collected 348 voice recordings during clinical interviews of 104 patients diagnosed with mood disorders at baseline and 2, 4, 8, and 12 months after recruitment. Suicidality was assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation and suicidal behavior using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The acoustic features of the voice, including temporal, formal, and spectral features, were extracted from the recordings. A between-person classification model that examines the vocal characteristics of individuals cross sectionally to detect individuals at high risk for suicide and a within-person classification model that detects considerable worsening of suicidality based on changes in acoustic features within an individual were developed and compared. Internal validation was performed using 10-fold cross validation of audio data from baseline to 2-month and external validation was performed using data from 2 to 4 months. Results: A combined set of 12 acoustic features and 3 demographic variables (age, sex, and past suicide attempts) were included in the single-layer artificial neural network for the between-person classification model. Furthermore, 13 acoustic features were included in the extreme gradient boosting machine learning algorithm for the within-person model. The between-person classifier was able to detect high suicidality with 69% accuracy (sensitivity 74%, specificity 62%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.62), whereas the within-person model was able to predict worsening suicidality over 2 months with 79% accuracy (sensitivity 68%, specificity 84%, area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.67). The second model showed 62% accuracy in predicting increased suicidality in external sets. Conclusions: Within-person analysis using changes in acoustic features within an individual is a promising approach to detect increased suicidality. Automated analysis of voice can be used to support the real-time assessment of suicide risk in primary care or telemedicine.",10.2196/45456,9,Scopus,85151043832,2-s2.0-85151043832,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151043832
"Analyzing User-Generated Web-Based Posts of Adolescents’ Emotional, Behavioral, and Symptom Responses to Beliefs about Depression: Qualitative Thematic Analysis",Dysthe K.K.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Depression is common during adolescence. Early intervention can prevent it from developing into more progressive mental disorders. Combining information technology and clinical psychoeducation is a promising way to intervene at an earlier stage. However, data-driven research on the cognitive response to health information targeting adolescents with symptoms of depression is lacking. Objective: This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap through a new understanding of adolescents’ cognitive response to health information about depression. This knowledge can help to develop population-specific information technology, such as chatbots, in addition to clinical therapeutic tools for use in general practice. Methods: The data set consists of 1870 depression-related questions posted by adolescents on a public web-based information service. Most of the posts contain descriptions of events that lead to depression. On a sample of 100 posts, we conducted a qualitative thematic analysis based on cognitive behavioral theory investigating behavioral, emotional, and symptom responses to beliefs associated with depression. Results: Results were organized into four themes. (1) Hopelessness, appearing as a set of negative beliefs about the future, possibly results from erroneous beliefs about the causal link between risk factors and the course of depression. We found beliefs about establishing a sturdy therapy alliance as a responsibility resting on the patient. (2) Therapy hesitancy seemed to be associated with negative beliefs about therapy prognosis and doubts about confidentiality. (3) Social shame appeared as a consequence of impaired daily function when the cause is not acknowledged. (4) Failing to attain social interaction appeared to be associated with a negative symptom response. In contrast, actively obtaining social support reduces symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Conclusions: These results could be used to meet the clinical aims stated by earlier psychoeducation development, such as instilling hope through direct reattribution of beliefs about the future; challenging causal attributions, thereby lowering therapy hesitancy; reducing shame through the mechanisms of externalization by providing a tentative diagnosis despite the risk of stigmatizing; and providing initial symptom relief by giving advice on how to open up and reveal themselves to friends and family and balance the message of self-management to fit coping capabilities. An active counseling style advises the patient to approach the social environment, demonstrating an attitude toward self-action.",10.2196/37289,3,Scopus,85147048297,2-s2.0-85147048297,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147048297

Associations Between Smartphone Keystroke Metadata and Mental Health Symptoms in Adolescents: Findings From the Future Proofing Study,Braund T.A.,2023,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Mental disorders are prevalent during adolescence. Among the digital phenotypes currently being developed to monitor mental health symptoms, typing behavior is one promising candidate. However, few studies have directly assessed associations between typing behavior and mental health symptom severity, and whether these relationships differs between genders. Objective: In a cross-sectional analysis of a large cohort, we tested whether various features of typing behavior derived from keystroke metadata were associated with mental health symptoms and whether these relationships differed between genders. Methods: A total of 934 adolescents from the Future Proofing study undertook 2 typing tasks on their smartphones through the Future Proofing app. Common keystroke timing and frequency features were extracted across tasks. Mental health symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-Adolescent version, the Children's Anxiety Scale-Short Form, the Distress Questionnaire 5, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Bivariate correlations were used to test whether keystroke features were associated with mental health symptoms. The false discovery rates of P values were adjusted to q values. Machine learning models were trained and tested using independent samples (ie, 80% train 20% test) to identify whether keystroke features could be combined to predict mental health symptoms. Results: Keystroke timing features showed a weak negative association with mental health symptoms across participants. When split by gender, females showed weak negative relationships between keystroke timing features and mental health symptoms, and weak positive relationships between keystroke frequency features and mental health symptoms. The opposite relationships were found for males (except for dwell). Machine learning models using keystroke features alone did not predict mental health symptoms. Conclusions: Increased mental health symptoms are weakly associated with faster typing, with important gender differences. Keystroke metadata should be collected longitudinally and combined with other digital phenotypes to enhance their clinical relevance.",10.2196/44986,9,Scopus,85159803757,2-s2.0-85159803757,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159803757
Toward Digital Phenotypes of Early Childhood Mental Health via Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning,Loftness B.C.,2023,Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society EMBS,"Childhood mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD are commonly-occurring and often go undetected into adolescence or adulthood. This can lead to detrimental impacts on long-term wellbeing and quality of life. Current parent-report assessments for pre-school aged children are often biased, and thus increase the need for objective mental health screening tools. Leveraging digital tools to identify the behavioral signature of childhood mental disorders may enable increased intervention at the time with the highest chance of long-term impact. We present data from 84 participants (4-8 years old, 50% diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and/or ADHD) collected during a battery of mood induction tasks using the ChAMP System. Unsupervised Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) constructed from movement and audio features indicate that age did not tend to explain clusters as consistently as gender within task-specific and cross-task SOMs. Symptom prevalence and diagnostic status also showed some evidence of clustering. Case studies suggest that high impairment (>80th percentile symptom counts) and diagnostic subtypes (ADHD-Combined) may account for most behaviorally distinct children. Based on this same dataset, we also present results from supervised modeling for the binary classification of diagnoses. Our top performing models yield moderate but promising results (ROC AUC.6-.82, TPR.36-.71, Accuracy.62-.86) on par with our previous efforts for isolated behavioral tasks. Enhancing features, tuning model parameters, and incorporating additional wearable sensor data will continue to enable the rapid progression towards the discovery of digital phenotypes of childhood mental health.Clinical Relevance-This work advances the use of wearables for detecting childhood mental health disorders.",10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340806,7,Scopus,85179644685,2-s2.0-85179644685,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179644685
POST-COVID NEUROPSYCHIATRIC COMPLICATIONS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A STUDY DESIGN FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES,Gadelshina D.,2023,Psychiatria Danubina,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the child and adolescent population, with long-term consequences for physical health, socio-psychological well-being, and cognitive development, which require further investigation. We herein describe a study design protocol for recognizing neuropsychiatric complications associated with pediatric COVID-19, and for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies grounded on the evidence-based findings. Methods: The study includes two cohorts, each with 163 participants, aged from 7 to 18 years old, and matched by gender. One cohort consisted of individuals with a history of COVID-19, while the other group presents those without such a history. We undertake comprehensive assessments, including neuropsychiatric evaluations, blood tests, and validated questionnaires completed by parents/guardians and by the children themselves. The data analysis is based on machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric complications in children and adolescents. Results: The first model is focused on a binary classification to distinguish participants with and without a history of COVID-19. The second model clusters significant indicators of clinical dynamics during the follow-up observation period, including the persistence of COVID-19 related somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms over time. The third model manages the predictors of discrete trajectories in the dynamics of post-COVID-19 states, tailored for personalized prediction modeling of affective, behavioral, cognitive, disturbances (academic/school performance), and somatic symptoms of the long COVID. Conclusions: The current protocol outlines a comprehensive study design aiming to bring a better understanding of COVID-19associated neuropsychiatric complications in a population of children and adolescents, and to create a mobile phone-based applications for the diagnosis and treatment of affective, cognitive, and behavioral conditions. The study will inform about the improved management of preventive and personalized care strategies for pediatric COVID-19 patients.

"A Personalized, Transdiagnostic Smartphone Intervention (Mello) Targeting Repetitive Negative Thinking in Young People With Depression and Anxiety: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial",Bell I.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a key transdiagnostic mechanism underpinning depression and anxiety. Using “just-in-time adaptive interventions” via smartphones may disrupt RNT in real time, providing targeted and personalized intervention. Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes and mechanisms of Mello—a fully automated, personalized, transdiagnostic, and mechanistic smartphone intervention targeting RNT in young people with depression and anxiety. Methods: Participants with heightened depression, anxiety, and RNT were recruited via social media and randomized to receive Mello or a nonactive control over a 6-week intervention period. Assessments were completed via Zoom sessions at baseline and at 3 and 6 weeks after baseline. Results: The findings supported feasibility and acceptability, with high rates of recruitment (N=55), uptake (55/64, 86% of eligible participants), and retention (52/55, 95% at 6 weeks). Engagement was high, with 90% (26/29) and 59% (17/29) of the participants in the Mello condition still using the app during the third and sixth weeks, respectively. Greater reductions in depression (Cohen d=0.50), anxiety (Cohen d=0.61), and RNT (Cohen d=0.87) were observed for Mello users versus controls. Mediation analyses suggested that changes in depression and anxiety were accounted for by changes in RNT. Conclusions: The results indicate that mechanistic, targeted, and real-time technology-based solutions may provide scalable and effective interventions that advance the treatment of youth mental ill health.",10.2196/47860,18,Scopus,85179648098,2-s2.0-85179648098,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179648098
Detecting Clinically Relevant Emotional Distress and Functional Impairment in Children and Adolescents: Protocol for an Automated Speech Analysis Algorithm Development Study,Alemu Y.,2023,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, children and adolescents were experiencing a mental health crisis, partly due to a lack of quality mental health services. The rate of suicide for Black youth has increased by 80%. By 2025, the health care system will be short of 225,000 therapists, further exacerbating the current crisis. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for providers, schools, youth mental health, and pediatric medical providers to integrate innovation in digital mental health to identify problems proactively and rapidly for effective collaboration with other health care providers. Such approaches can help identify robust, reproducible, and generalizable predictors and digital biomarkers of treatment response in psychiatry. Among the multitude of digital innovations to identify a biomarker for psychiatric diseases currently, as part of the macrolevel digital health transformation, speech stands out as an attractive candidate with features such as affordability, noninvasive, and nonintrusive. Objective: The protocol aims to develop speech-emotion recognition algorithms leveraging artificial intelligence/machine learning, which can establish a link between trauma, stress, and voice types, including disrupting speech-based characteristics, and detect clinically relevant emotional distress and functional impairments in children and adolescents. Methods: Informed by theoretical foundations (the Theory of Psychological Trauma Biomarkers and Archetypal Voice Categories), we developed our methodology to focus on 5 emotions: anger, happiness, fear, neutral, and sadness. Participants will be recruited from 2 local mental health centers that serve urban youths. Speech samples, along with responses to the Symptom and Functioning Severity Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and Adverse Childhood Experiences scales, will be collected using an Android mobile app. Our model development pipeline is informed by Gaussian mixture model (GMM), recurrent neural network, and long short-term memory. Results: We tested our model with a public data set. The GMM with 128 clusters showed an evenly distributed accuracy across all 5 emotions. Using utterance-level features, GMM achieved an accuracy of 79.15% overall, while frame selection increased accuracy to 85.35%. This demonstrates that GMM is a robust model for emotion classification of all 5 emotions and that emotion frame selection enhances accuracy, which is significant for scientific evaluation. Recruitment and data collection for the study were initiated in August 2021 and are currently underway. The study results are likely to be available and published in 2024. Conclusions: This study contributes to the literature as it addresses the need for speech-focused digital health tools to detect clinically relevant emotional distress and functional impairments in children and adolescents. The preliminary results show that our algorithm has the potential to improve outcomes. The findings will contribute to the broader digital health transformation.",10.2196/46970,9,Scopus,85163878578,2-s2.0-85163878578,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163878578
"The Impact of Generative Conversational Artificial Intelligence on the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Community: Scoping Review",Bragazzi N.L.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Despite recent significant strides toward acceptance, inclusion, and equality, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community still face alarming mental health disparities, being almost 3 times more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts than their heterosexual counterparts. These unique psychological challenges are due to discrimination, stigmatization, and identity-related struggles and can potentially benefit from generative conversational artificial intelligence (AI). As the latest advancement in AI, conversational agents and chatbots can imitate human conversation and support mental health, fostering diversity and inclusivity, combating stigma, and countering discrimination. In contrast, if not properly designed, they can perpetuate exclusion and inequities. Objective: This study aims to examine the impact of generative conversational AI on the LGBTQ community. Methods: This study was designed as a scoping review. Four electronic scholarly databases (Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and MEDLINE via PubMed) and gray literature (Google Scholar) were consulted from inception without any language restrictions. Original studies focusing on the LGBTQ community or counselors working with this community exposed to chatbots and AI-enhanced internet-based platforms and exploring the feasibility, acceptance, or effectiveness of AI-enhanced tools were deemed eligible. The findings were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Results: Seven applications (HIVST-Chatbot, TelePrEP Navigator, Amanda Selfie, Crisis Contact Simulator, REALbot, Tough Talks, and Queer AI) were included and reviewed. The chatbots and internet-based assistants identified served various purposes: (1) to identify LGBTQ individuals at risk of suicide or contracting HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, (2) to provide resources to LGBTQ youth from underserved areas, (3) facilitate HIV status disclosure to sex partners, and (4) develop training role-play personas encompassing the diverse experiences and intersecting identities of LGBTQ youth to educate counselors. The use of generative conversational AI for the LGBTQ community is still in its early stages. Initial studies have found that deploying chatbots is feasible and well received, with high ratings for usability and user satisfaction. However, there is room for improvement in terms of the content provided and making conversations more engaging and interactive. Many of these studies used small sample sizes and short-term interventions measuring limited outcomes. Conclusions: Generative conversational AI holds promise, but further development and formal evaluation are needed, including studies with larger samples, longer interventions, and randomized trials to compare different content, delivery methods, and dissemination platforms. In addition, a focus on engagement with behavioral objectives is essential to advance this field. The findings have broad practical implications, highlighting that AI's impact spans various aspects of people's lives. Assessing AI's impact on diverse communities and adopting diversity-aware and intersectional approaches can help shape AI's positive impact on society as a whole.",10.2196/52091,28,Scopus,85178995711,2-s2.0-85178995711,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178995711
Breaking the Cyberbullying Cycle With Machine Learning,Chan J.,2023,Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering Csde 2023,"The proliferation of digital communication platforms has provided adolescents with unparalleled connectivity, yet it has concurrently amplified the menace of cyberbullying.

Prediction of Diagnosis and Treatment Response in Adolescents With Depression by Using a Smartphone App and Deep Learning Approaches: Usability Study,Kim J.S.,2023,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Lack of quantifiable biomarkers is a major obstacle in diagnosing and treating depression. In adolescents, increasing suicidality during antidepressant treatment further complicates the problem. Objective: We sought to evaluate digital biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment response of depression in adolescents through a newly developed smartphone app. Methods: We developed the Smart Healthcare System for Teens At Risk for Depression and Suicide app for Android-based smartphones. This app passively collected data reflecting the social and behavioral activities of adolescents, such as their smartphone usage time, physical movement distance, and the number of phone calls and text messages during the study period. Our study consisted of 24 adolescents (mean age 15.4 [SD 1.4] years, 17 girls) with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed with Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version and 10 healthy controls (mean age 13.8 [SD 0.6] years, 5 girls). After 1 week's baseline data collection, adolescents with MDD were treated with escitalopram in an 8-week, open-label trial. Participants were monitored for 5 weeks, including the baseline data collection period. Their psychiatric status was measured every week. Depression severity was measured using the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale was administered in order to assess suicide severity. We applied the deep learning approach for the analysis of the data. Deep neural network was employed for diagnosis classification, and neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions was used for feature selection. Results: We could predict the diagnosis of depression with training accuracy of 96.3% and 3-fold validation accuracy of 77%. Of the 24 adolescents with MDD, 10 responded to antidepressant treatments. We predicted the treatment response of adolescents with MDD with training accuracy of 94.2% and 3-fold validation accuracy of 76%. Adolescents with MDD tended to move longer distances and use smartphones for longer periods of time compared to controls. The deep learning analysis showed that smartphone usage time was the most important feature in distinguishing adolescents with MDD from controls. Prominent differences were not observed in the pattern of each feature between the treatment responders and nonresponders. The deep learning analysis revealed that the total length of calls received as the most important feature predicting antidepressant response in adolescents with MDD.

Predicting Mental Health Disorders Post Long COVID Diagnosis Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques,Purohit M.,2023,Proceedings 2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data Bigdata 2023,"After the global spread of COVID-19, the enduring effects of Long COVID and its health implications have emerged as a significant global issue, affecting people worldwide. The lingering symptoms post a COVID-19 infection can significantly affect individuals who had previously contracted the virus, exerting considerable influence over their mental well-being. Prolonged recuperation associated with Long COVID has been connected with the emergence of symptoms such as depression and anxiety, all of which can have adverse effects on emotional health. This paper delves into an in-depth analysis of healthcare data pertaining to Long COVID from the Froedtert Health Medical System in Wisconsin. Through the application of advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques, we present predictive models aimed at assessing the risk of developing Mental Health Disorders (MHD) in patients diagnosed with Long COVID. Our study also encompasses the identification of pivotal features impacting MHD. To thoroughly investigate the factors that have a substantial impact on MHD, we employed the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) technique to carefully pick out essential attributes from our dataset. Given the dataset's inherent imbalance, we have employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMO-TEEN) technique to effectively address this issue. Multiple ML models have been meticulously constructed and validated using cross-validation methodologies. The results indicate that Random Forest (RF) Classifier shows better performance in comparison to other models with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97, precision of 0.90, and recall of 0.89. Remarkably, the XGBoost Classifier also demonstrates strong predictive abilities for MHD, achieving an AUC of 0.90, precision of 0.79, and recall of 0.82. Ultimately, the crucial features identified through our predictive models hold the potential to identify individuals at risk of MHD, facilitating the delivery of targeted preventive care and essential resources.",10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386523,1,Scopus,85184980298,2-s2.0-85184980298,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184980298
Duty to Respond: The Challenges Social Service Providers Face When Charged With Keeping Youth Safe Online,Caddle X.V.,2023,Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction,"Social service providers play a vital role in the developmental outcomes of underprivileged youth as they transition into adulthood. Educators, mental health professionals, juvenile justice officers, and child welfare caseworkers often have first-hand knowledge of the trials uniquely faced by these vulnerable youth and are charged with mitigating harmful risks, such as mental health challenges, child abuse, drug use, and sex trafficking. Yet, less is known about whether or how social service providers assess and mitigate theonline risk experiences of youth under their care. Therefore, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program, we conducted interviews with 37 social service providers (SSPs) who work with underprivileged youth to determine what (if any) online risks are most concerning to them given their role in youth protection, how they assess or become aware of these online risk experiences, and whether they see value in the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution for online risk detection. Overall, online sexual risks (e.g., sexual grooming and abuse) and cyberbullying were the most salient concern across all social service domains, especially when these experiences crossed the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds. Yet, SSPs had to rely heavily on youth self-reports to know whether and when online risks occurred, which required building a trusting relationship with youth; otherwise, SSPs became aware only after a formal investigation had been launched. Therefore, most SSPs found value in the potential for using AI as an early detection system and to monitor youth, but they were concerned that such a solution would not be feasible due to a lack of resources to adequately respond to online incidences, access to the necessary digital trace data (e.g., social media), context, and concerns about violating the trust relationships they built with youth. Thus, such automated risk detection systems should be designed and deployed with caution, as their implementation could cause youth to mistrust adults, thereby limiting the receipt of necessary guidance and support. We add to the bodies of research on adolescent online safety and the benefits and challenges of leveraging algorithmic systems in the public sector.",10.1145/3567556,13,Scopus,85147245492,2-s2.0-85147245492,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147245492
Toward Detection of Arabic Cyberbullying on Online Social Networks using Arabic BERT Models,Alfarah M.E.,2023,2023 International Symposium on Networks Computers and Communications Isncc 2023,"Cyberbullying is one of the serious threats on social networks particularly toward children and teenagers. Cyberbullying can cause many harmful consequences towards victims such as anxiety, depression and even suicide. This research studies cyberbullying detection in Arabic language on online social networks using deep learning techniques to automatically detect and quarantine the cyberbullying messages to safe children from getting exposed to harmful cyberbullying content. In this paper, real Arabic dataset is collected from YouTube and Twitter that is annotated manually to improve the quality of the data. All experiments went through three rounds of trials to make sure that the results are consistent. Many evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers such as macro F1 score and AUC.

"Associations Among Web-Based Civic Engagement and Discrimination, Web-Based Social Support, and Mental Health and Substance Use Risk Among LGBT Youth: Cross-Sectional Survey Study",Tao X.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Social media use is ubiquitous among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender or nonbinary (LGBT) adolescents. The time spent on LGBT sites and involvement in social justice–oriented web-based civic activities can increase exposure to heterosexist and transphobic posts, resulting in increases in depression, anxiety, and substance use. Collaborative social justice civic engagement may also increase LGBT adolescents’ social support on the web, which may buffer the mental health and substance use risks associated with web-based discrimination. Objective: Drawing on the minority stress and stress-buffering hypotheses, this study aimed to test time spent on LGBT sites, involvement in web-based social justice activities, the mediating effect of web-based discrimination, and the moderating effect of web-based social support on mental health and substance use. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey conducted from October 20 to November 18, 2022, analyzed data from 571 respondents (mean age 16.4, SD 1.1 years): 125 cisgender lesbian girls, 186 cisgender gay boys, 111 cisgender bisexual adolescents, and 149 transgender or nonbinary adolescents. Measures included demographics, web-based LGBT identity disclosure, hours per week spent on LGBT social media sites, engagement in web-based social justice activities (Online Civic Engagement Behavior Construct), exposure to web-based discrimination (Online Victimization Scale), web-based social support (adapted from scales examining web-based interactions), depressive and anxiety symptoms, and substance use (the Patient Health Questionnaire modified for Adolescents; Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item; and Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble Screening Test). Results: The time spent on LGBT social media sites was unrelated to web-based discrimination after civic engagement was accounted for (90% CI −0.007 to 0.004). Web-based social justice civic engagement was positively associated with social support (β=.4, 90% CI 0.2-0.4), exposure to discrimination (β=.6, 90% CI 0.5-0.7), and higher substance use risk (β=.2, 90% CI 0.2-0.6). Consistent with minority stress theory, exposure to web-based discrimination fully mediated the positive association between LGBT justice civic engagement and depressive (β=.3, 90% CI 0.2-0.4) and anxiety symptoms (β=.3, 90% CI 0.2-0.4). Web-based social support did not moderate the association between exposure to discrimination with depressive (90% CI −0.07 to 0.1) and anxiety symptoms (90% CI −0.06 to 0.1) and substance use (90% CI −0.04 to 0.01). Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of examining LGBT youth’s specific web-based activities and the need for future research to focus on the intersectional experiences of LGBT adolescents from racial and ethnic minoritized groups through culturally sensitive questions. This study also calls for social media platforms to implement policies that mitigate the effects of algorithms that expose youth to heterosexist and transphobic messaging, such as adopting machine learning algorithms that can efficiently recognize and remove harmful content.",10.2196/46604,13,Scopus,85163868622,2-s2.0-85163868622,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163868622
An Artificial Therapist (Manage Your Life Online) to Support the Mental Health of Youth: Co-Design and Case Series,Wrightson-Hester A.R.,2023,Jmir Human Factors,"Background: The prevalence of child and adolescent mental health issues is increasing faster than the number of services available, leading to a shortfall. Mental health chatbots are a highly scalable method to address this gap. Manage Your Life Online (MYLO) is an artificially intelligent chatbot that emulates the method of levels therapy. Method of levels is a therapy that uses curious questioning to support the sustained awareness and exploration of current problems. Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a co-designed interface for MYLO in young people aged 16 to 24 years with mental health problems. Methods: An iterative co-design phase occurred over 4 months, in which feedback was elicited from a group of young people (n=7) with lived experiences of mental health issues. This resulted in the development of a progressive web application version of MYLO that could be used on mobile phones. We conducted a case series to assess the feasibility and acceptability of MYLO in 13 young people over 2 weeks. During this time, the participants tested MYLO and completed surveys including clinical outcomes and acceptability measures. We then conducted focus groups and interviews and used thematic analysis to obtain feedback on MYLO and identify recommendations for further improvements. Results: Most participants were positive about their experience of using MYLO and would recommend MYLO to others. The participants enjoyed the simplicity of the interface, found it easy to use, and rated it as acceptable using the System Usability Scale. Inspection of the use data found evidence that MYLO can learn and adapt its questioning in response to user input. We found a large effect size for the decrease in participants’ problem-related distress and a medium effect size for the increase in their self-reported tendency to resolve goal conflicts (the proposed mechanism of change) in the testing phase. Some patients also experienced a reliable change in their clinical outcome measures over the 2 weeks. Conclusions: We established the feasibility and acceptability of MYLO. The initial outcomes suggest that MYLO has the potential to support the mental health of young people and help them resolve their own problems. We aim to establish whether the use of MYLO leads to a meaningful reduction in participants’ symptoms of depression and anxiety and whether these are maintained over time by conducting a randomized controlled evaluation trial.",10.2196/46849,19,Scopus,85167513904,2-s2.0-85167513904,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167513904
A Relational Agent Intervention for Adolescents Seeking Mental Health Treatment: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,Chiauzzi E.,2023,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Unmet pediatric mental health (MH) needs are growing as rates of pediatric depression and anxiety dramatically increase. Access to care is limited by multiple factors, including a shortage of clinicians trained in developmentally specific, evidence-based services. Novel approaches to MH care delivery, including technology-leveraged and readily accessible options, need to be evaluated in service of expanding evidence-based services to youths and their families. Preliminary evidence supports the use of Woebot, a relational agent that digitally delivers guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) through a mobile app, for adults with MH concerns. However, no studies have evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of such app-delivered relational agents specifically for adolescents with depression and/or anxiety within an outpatient MH clinic, nor compared them to other MH support services. Objective: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of an investigational device, Woebot for Adolescents (W-GenZD), within an outpatient MH clinic for youths presenting with depression and/or anxiety. The study’s secondary aim will compare the clinical outcomes of self-reported depressive symptoms with W-GenZD and a telehealth-delivered CBT-based skills group (CBT-group). Tertiary aims will evaluate additional clinical outcomes and therapeutic alliance between adolescents in W-GenZD and the CBT-group. Methods: Participants include youths aged 13-17 years with depression and/or anxiety seeking care from an outpatient MH clinic at a children’s hospital. Eligible youths will have no recent safety concerns or complex comorbid clinical diagnoses; have no concurrent individual therapy; and, if on medications, are on stable doses, based on clinical screening and as well as study-specific criteria. Results: Recruitment began in May 2022. As of December 8, 2022, we have randomized 133 participants. Conclusions: Establishing the feasibility and acceptability of W-GenZD within an outpatient MH clinical setting will add to the field’s current understanding of the utility and implementation considerations of this MH care service modality. The study will also evaluate the noninferiority of W-GenZD against the CBT-group. Findings may also have implications for patients, families, and providers looking for additional MH support options for adolescents seeking help for their depression and/or anxiety. Such options expand the menu of supports for youths with lower-intensity needs as well as possibly reduce waitlists and optimize clinician deployment toward more severe cases.",10.2196/44940,6,Scopus,85151428451,2-s2.0-85151428451,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151428451
Improving the Well-being of Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Study Exploring Acceptability and Clinical Usability of a Self-compassion Chatbot,Boggiss A.,2023,Jmir Diabetes,"Background: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) had already experienced far greater rates of psychological distress than their peers. With the pandemic further challenging mental health and increasing the barriers to maintaining optimal diabetes self-management, it is vital that this population has access to remotely deliverable, evidence-based interventions to improve psychological and diabetes outcomes. Chatbots, defined as digital conversational agents, offer these unique advantages, as well as the ability to engage in empathetic and personalized conversations 24-7. Building on previous work developing a self-compassion program for adolescents with T1D, a self-compassion chatbot (COMPASS) was developed for adolescents with T1D to address these concerns. However, the acceptability and potential clinical usability of a chatbot to deliver self-compassion coping tools to adolescents with T1D remained unknown. Objective: This qualitative study was designed to evaluate the acceptability and potential clinical utility of COMPASS among adolescents aged 12 to 16 years with T1D and diabetes health care professionals. Methods: Potential adolescent participants were recruited from previous participant lists, and on the web and in-clinic study flyers, whereas health care professionals were recruited via clinic emails and from diabetes research special interest groups. Qualitative Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) interviews exploring views on COMPASS were conducted with 19 adolescents (in 4 focus groups) and 11 diabetes health care professionals (in 2 focus groups and 6 individual interviews) from March 2022 to April 2022. Transcripts were analyzed using directed content analysis to examine the features and content of greatest importance to both groups. Results: Adolescents were broadly representative of the youth population living with T1D in Aotearoa (11/19, 58% female; 13/19, 68% Aotearoa New Zealand European; and 2/19, 11% Maori). Health care professionals represented a range of disciplines, including diabetes nurse specialists (3/11, 27%), health psychologists (3/11, 27%), dieticians (3/11, 27%), and endocrinologists (2/11, 18%). The findings offer insight into what adolescents with T1D and their health care professionals see as the shared advantages of COMPASS and desired future additions, such as personalization (mentioned by all 19 adolescents), self-management support (mentioned by 13/19, 68% of adolescents), clinical utility (mentioned by all 11 health care professionals), and breadth and flexibility of tools (mentioned by 10/11, 91% of health care professionals). Conclusions: Early data suggest that COMPASS is acceptable, is relevant to common difficulties, and has clinical utility during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, shared desired features among both groups, including problem-solving and integration with diabetes technology to support self-management; creating a safe peer-to-peer sense of community; and broadening the representation of cultures, lived experience stories, and diabetes challenges, could further improve the potential of the chatbot. On the basis of these findings, COMPASS is currently being improved to be tested in a feasibility study.",10.2196/40641,18,Scopus,85159805888,2-s2.0-85159805888,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159805888
Reinventing mental health care in youth through mobile approaches: Current status and future steps,Marciano L.,2023,Frontiers in Psychology,"In this perspective, we aim to bring together research on mobile assessments and interventions in the context of mental health care in youth. After the COVID-19 pandemic, one out of five young people is experiencing mental health problems worldwide. New ways to face this burden are now needed. Young people search for low-burden services in terms of costs and time, paired with high flexibility and easy accessibility. Mobile applications meet these principles by providing new ways to inform, monitor, educate, and enable self-help, thus reinventing mental health care in youth. In this perspective, we explore the existing literature reviews on mobile assessments and interventions in youth through data collected passively (e.g., digital phenotyping) and actively (e.g., using Ecological Momentary Assessments—EMAs). The richness of such approaches relies on assessing mental health dynamically by extending beyond the confines of traditional methods and diagnostic criteria, and the integration of sensor data from multiple channels, thus allowing the cross-validation of symptoms through multiple information. However, we also acknowledge the promises and pitfalls of such approaches, including the problem of interpreting small effects combined with different data sources and the real benefits in terms of outcome prediction when compared to gold-standard methods. We also explore a new promising and complementary approach, using chatbots and conversational agents, that encourages interaction while tracing health and providing interventions. Finally, we suggest that it is important to continue to move beyond the ill-being framework by giving more importance to intervention fostering well-being, e.g., using positive psychology.",10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1126015,8,Scopus,85150707648,2-s2.0-85150707648,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150707648
Modeling Messaging Metadata to Identify Digital Disagreements among Non-incarcerated Adolescents in the Juvenile Justice System,Pandey H.,2023,2023 11th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Acii 2023,"The psychological wellbeing of adolescents, including their relationships with their parents and friends, is highly affected by romantic relationship conflict. At-risk youth - who are involved with the juvenile justice system and are especially vulnerable to aggression, defiance, and behavioral problems - experience relationship conflict at rates that exceed those of youth in the community. The pervasive usage of mobile technology by adolescents provides unprecedented data on their social interactions, communication patterns, and romantic relationship conflicts; as well as an opportunity to develop timely interventions to improve their wellbeing. This study investigates the potential of utilizing text messaging metadata from conversations with parental figures, friends, and other social connections for scalable early identification of moments of disagreement in romantic relationships in non-incarcerated, justice-involved youth. We utilize changepoint detection on text message metadata across various relationships, including the number of messages, length of messages, and response time, to identify changes in communication patterns across hours, days, and weeks, to estimate the day of a romantic disagreement. When comparing our predicted disagreement times to the current standard of intervention delivery, at random, we found statistically significant improvements in predicting disagreements with romantic partners. Our findings demonstrate that messaging metadata can effectively identify moments of disagreement in adolescents, and can be used for the delivery of just-in-time interventions for high-risk adolescents.",10.1109/ACII59096.2023.10388170,1,Scopus,85184659630,2-s2.0-85184659630,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184659630
Factors Affecting Mental Health of High School Students due to COVID-19: An Exploratory Study,Reza M.R.,2023,2023 International Conference on Next Generation Computing Iot and Machine Learning Ncim 2023,"Mental health is one of the most significant factors in the human life span. It also influences how we interact with people, manage stress, and make good decisions. From childhood and youth through maturity, mental health is crucial at every stage of life. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes more vulnerable and affects teenagers as others. In this study, high school students' (10-19 years old) mental health states and the most contributing factors that affect their mental health were assessed through a statistical and machine learning-based approach. The study data were collected through an online survey and received responses from 158 respondents. The data were analyzed statistically with a chi-square test and path analysis considering all the possible factors of anxiety and depression to determine the most contributing factors. Besides, a few Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been developed such as Logistic Regression(LR), Support Vector Machine(SVM), Naive Bayes(NB), AdaBoost(AB), and Random Forest(RF) for the prediction of anxiety and depression and found that AdaBoost achieved the highest score (86%). As outcomes, the overall analysis revealed that academic concerns such as poor understanding of online classes, daily activities like sleep pattern disruption, and extended uses of electronic devices are the major causes of the deterioration of high school students' mental health.",10.1109/NCIM59001.2023.10212757,2,Scopus,85170563446,2-s2.0-85170563446,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170563446
Analysis of the Distractions in Youth Due to Social Media and the Effects on Their Concentration Abilities,Prajwal S.,2023,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"Distraction is a phenomenon that diverts one’s attention from a desired task. It includes external factors such as addiction toward social media, web surfing, electronic gadgets, texting, and also, the internal factors like laziness, nervousness, lack of concentration, etc. Sometimes, distraction can be useful to divert from a trauma or misery. However, it creates an adverse effect on the person’s mental health by causing anxiety, depression, behavioral changes, loss of interest in humans which affects their career and even leads to death. This study mainly focuses on distractions in youth and its effects on their personal mental health. A quantitative approach was used in collecting and analyzing the data by distributing google forms and verbal response from to the students.

Digital Personal Health Coaching Platform for Promoting Human Papillomavirus Infection Vaccinations and Cancer Prevention: Knowledge Graph-Based Recommendation System,Ammar N.,2023,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Health promotion can empower populations to gain more control over their well-being by using digital interventions that focus on preventing the root causes of diseases. Digital platforms for personalized health coaching can improve health literacy and information-seeking behavior, leading to better health outcomes. Personal health records have been designed to enhance patients’ self-management of a disease or condition. Existing personal health records have been mostly designed and deployed as a supplementary service that acts as views into electronic health records. Objective: We aim to overcome some of the limitations of electronic health records. This study aims to design and develop a personal health library (PHL) that generates personalized recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine promotion and cancer prevention. Methods: We have designed a proof-of-concept prototype of the Digital Personal Health Librarian, which leverages machine learning; natural language processing; and several innovative technological infrastructures, including the Semantic Web, social linked data, web application programming interfaces, and hypermedia-based discovery, to generate a personal health knowledge graph. Results: We have designed and implemented a proof-of-the-concept prototype to showcase and demonstrate how the PHL can be used to store an individual’s health data, for example, a personal health knowledge graph. This is integrated with web-scale knowledge to support HPV vaccine promotion and prevent HPV-associated cancers among adolescents and their caregivers. We also demonstrated how the Digital Personal Health Librarian uses the PHL to provide evidence-based insights and knowledge-driven explanations that are personalized and inform health decision-making. Conclusions: Digital platforms such as the PHL can be instrumental in improving precision health promotion and education strategies that address population-specific needs (ie, health literacy, digital competency, and language barriers) and empower individuals by facilitating knowledge acquisition to make healthy choices.",10.2196/50210,3,Scopus,85179158884,2-s2.0-85179158884,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179158884
Preventing Cyberbullying on Social Networks with Spanish Parental Control NLP System,León-Paredes G.A.,2023,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,"The boom in social networks and digital communication has given place to innovative forms of social interaction. However, it has also made possible new forms of harassment of others anonymously and without repercussions. Such is the case of cyberbullying, an increasingly common problem, especially among young people. Its effects on individuals can be devastating, ranging from anxiety and depression to social isolation and low self-esteem. Furthermore, there is a wide variety of applications called parental control, which allow parents to show, the pages the child or adolescent has accessed, know how often the child or adolescent accesses them, and control the time spent on social networks or other entertainment platforms. Therefore, the present research aimed to analyze, design, and implement an intelligent application based on data mining algorithms and the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) method for the presumed detection of cyberbullying in social networks in adolescents. The methodological process of the study was carried out following the fundamentals of applied research with a qualitative-quantitative descriptive, and cross-sectional approach. As a result, a multiplatform application was obtained that alerts about suspected bullying to parents or guardians. For the validation of the application, the technique of expert judgment was applied. Also, the process of obtaining negative and positive text similarity was performed based on cosine similarity. In the analysis of Twitter accounts, values of 46% with negative texts and 6.71% with positive texts are obtained, which allows inferring that this is a presumed case of cyberbullying in this account.",10.14569/IJACSA.2023.01411141,1,Scopus,85179184202,2-s2.0-85179184202,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179184202
Comparative Analysis for Prediction and Classification of Mental Health Issues and Challenges Using Hybrid Learning Techniques,Nagaraj P.,2023,2023 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics Iccci 2023,"Mental health condition including sadness, anxiety, and sleep deprivation owns up to the emotional stress in young children, teens, and also in adults. It affects how a person thinks, ponders, feels, or responds to a certain circumstance or situation. Only if one has both good physical health and mental health, an individual can work productively and reach their full potential. Mental health is very important at every stage of life, from childhood to adulthood. We gathered information from online datasets that were readily available. For better prediction, the data has been labe-lencoded. To obtain labels, the data is subjected to several machine-learning approaches. The model that will be developed to forecast a person's mental health will then be based on these categorized labels. Working-class individuals over the age of 1S are our target market.

Cluster Ensemble Method and Convolution Neural Network Model for Predicting Mental Illness,Ananthapadmanabha M.V.,2023,International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering and Information Technology,"One in every four individuals has a diagnosable mental disease in a year. Around 20% of children and adolescents have a mental health condition and often ignore it. It is found that 93% of youth use social media to communicate and engage, as it reflects their emotions, moods, and thoughts. As a result, machine learning algorithms may anticipate people’s moods and emotions based on their postings and comments. On the other hand, psychometric tests use questions to determine how individuals think, feel, behave, and react. It is necessary to investigate a hybrid approach for identifying people’s mental illness by combining social media inputs and psychometric tests, especially during a pandemic. The hybrid approach can combine the results from both the models to reflect on the user’s digital & non-digital reactions to certain sensitive situations to determine their mental state. Hence, the present paper aims to develop a web framework that can forecast the emergence of mental illness in the future based on data from social media comments and real-time data from psychometric tests using machine learning algorithms. The proposed work includes the cluster ensemble method for social media posts and a convolution neural network model for psychometric tests. This model predicts mental illness with an accuracy of 87.05 percent.

Using Chatbot Technology to Improve Brazilian Adolescents’ Body Image and Mental Health at Scale: Randomized Controlled Trial,Matheson E.L.,2023,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Accessible, cost-effective, and scalable mental health interventions are limited, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where disparities between mental health needs and services are greatest. Microinterventions (ie, brief, stand-alone, or digital approaches) aim to provide immediate reprieve and enhancements in mental health states and offer a novel and scalable framework for embedding evidence-based mental health promotion techniques into digital environments. Body image is a global public health issue that increases young peoples’ risk of developing more severe mental and physical health issues. Embedding body image microinterventions into digital environments is one avenue for providing young people with immediate and short-term reprieve and protection from the negative exposure effects associated with social media. Objective: This 2-armed, fully remote, and preregistered randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of a body image chatbot containing microinterventions on Brazilian adolescents’ state and trait body image and associated well-being outcomes. Methods: Geographically diverse Brazilian adolescents aged 13-18 years (901/1715, 52.54% girls) were randomized into the chatbot or an assessment-only control condition and completed web-based self-assessments at baseline, immediately after the intervention time frame, and at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups. The primary outcomes were mean change in state (at chatbot entry and at the completion of a microintervention technique) and trait body image (before and after the intervention), with the secondary outcomes being mean change in affect (state and trait) and body image self-efficacy between the assessment time points. Results: Most participants who entered the chatbot (258/327, 78.9%) completed ≥1 microintervention technique, with participants completing an average of 5 techniques over the 72-hour intervention period. Chatbot users experienced small significant improvements in primary (state: P<.001, Cohen d=0.30, 95% CI 0.25-0.34; and trait body image: P=.02, Cohen d range=0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.18, to 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.32) and secondary outcomes across various time points (state: P<.001, Cohen d=0.28, 95% CI 0.22-0.33; trait positive affect: P=.02, Cohen d range=0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.27, to 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.37; negative affect: P=.03, Cohen d range=−0.16, 95% CI −0.30 to −0.02, to −0.18, 95% CI −0.33 to −0.03; and self-efficacy: P=.02, Cohen d range=0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.25, to 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.32) relative to the control condition. Intervention benefits were moderated by baseline levels of concerns but not by gender. Conclusions: This is the first large-scale randomized controlled trial assessing a body image chatbot among Brazilian adolescents. Intervention attrition was high (531/858, 61.9%) and reflected the broader digital intervention literature; barriers to engagement were discussed. Meanwhile, the findings support the emerging literature that indicates microinterventions and chatbot technology are acceptable and effective web-based service provisions. This study also offers a blueprint for accessible, cost-effective, and scalable digital approaches that address disparities between health care needs and provisions in low- and middle-income countries.",10.2196/39934,17,Scopus,85162683941,2-s2.0-85162683941,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162683941
"Korean adolescents’ coping strategies on self-harm, ADHD, insomnia during COVID-19: text mining of social media big data",Do R.,2023,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), public safety measures, including social distancing and school closures, have been implemented, precipitating psychological difficulties and heightened online activities for adolescents. However, studies examining the impact of the pandemic on adolescent mental health and their coping strategies in Asian countries are limited. Further, most studies have used survey measures to capture mental health challenges so far. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the psychological challenges South Korean adolescents experienced and their coping strategies during the pandemic using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text mining (TM) technique on adolescents’ social media texts/posts. Methods: The data were gathered from social media texts/posts such as online communities, Twitter, and personal blogs from January 1, 2019, to October 31, 2021. The 12,520,250 texts containing keywords related to adolescents’ common psychological difficulties reported during the pandemic, including self-harm, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD), and insomnia, were analyzed by TM, NLP using information extraction, co-occurrence and sentiment analysis. The monthly frequency of the keywords and their associated words was also analyzed to understand the time trend. Results: Adolescents used the word “self-harm” in their social media texts more frequently during the second wave of COVID-19 (August to September 2020). “Friends” was the most associated word with “self-harm.” While the frequency of texts with “Insomnia” stayed constant throughout the pandemic, the word “ADHD” was increasingly mentioned in social media. ADHD and insomnia were most frequently associated with ADHD medications and sleeping pills, respectively. Friends were generally associated with positive words, while parents were associated with negative words. Conclusion: During COVID-19, Korean adolescents often expressed their psychological challenges on social media platforms. However, their coping strategies seemed less efficient to help with their difficulties, warranting strategies to support them in the prolonged pandemic era. For example, Korean adolescents shared psychological challenges such as self-harm with friends rather than their parents. They considered using medicine (e.g., sleeping pills and ADHD medication) as coping strategies for sleep and attention problems.",10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1192123,1,Scopus,85178230502,2-s2.0-85178230502,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178230502

Analysis of the Status and Future Direction for Digital Therapeutics in Children and Adolescent Psychiatry,Choi H.,2023,Journal of the Korean Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Digital therapeutics based on software, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, games, and smartphone applications, are in the spotlight as new therapeutic alternatives in child and adolescent psychiatry. It draws attention to overcoming conventional therapeutics’ limitations, such as toxicity, cost, and accessibility, and encourages patients to participate in the treatment attractively. The growth potential of the digital therapeutics market for psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents in Korea and abroad has been highlighted. Clinical studies and Food and Drug Administration approvals for digital therapeutics have increased, and cases approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety have emerged in Korea. As seen above, digital transformation in child and adolescent psychiatry will change treatment paradigms significantly. Therefore, as this new field has just begun to emerge, it is necessary to verify the effectiveness and scope of the application of digital therapeutics and consider preparing a compensation system and institutional arrangements. Accordingly, this study analyzed the development trends and application status of digital therapeutics in children and adolescents and presented limitations and development directions from the perspective of application in healthcare. Further, the study is expected to identify the utility and limitations of digital therapeutics for children and adolescents and establish effective application measures.",10.5765/jkacap.230044,6,Scopus,85174322209,2-s2.0-85174322209,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174322209
Classification of Adolescents' Risky Behavior in Instant Messaging Conversations,Plhák J.,2023,Proceedings of Machine Learning Research,"Previous research on detecting risky online behavior has been rather scattered, typically identifying single risks in online samples. To our knowledge, the presented research is the first that presents a process of building models that can efficiently detect the following four online risky behavior: (1) aggression, harassment, hate; (2) mental health; (3) use of alcohol, and drugs; and (4) sexting. Furthermore, the corpora in this research are unique because of the usage of private instant messaging conversations in the Czech language provided by adolescents. The combination of publicly unavailable and unique data with high-quality annotations of specific psychological phenomena allowed us for precise detection using transformer machine learning models that can handle sequential data and involve the context of utterances. The impact of the context length and text augmentation on model efficiency is discussed in detail. The final model provides promising results with an acceptable F1 score. Therefore, we believe that the model could be used in various applications, e.g., parental applications, chatbots, or services provided by Internet providers. Future research could investigate the usage of the model in other languages.",,2,Scopus,85165152030,2-s2.0-85165152030,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165152030
Patterns of engagement in a digital mental health service during COVID-19: a cohort study for children and young people,Bernard A.,2023,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic increased public use of digital mental health technologies. However, little is known about changes in user engagement with these platforms during the pandemic. This study aims to assess engagement changes with a digital mental healthcare service during COVID-19. Methods: A cohort study based on routinely collected service usage data from a digital mental health support service in the United Kingdom. Returning users aged 14–25 years that interacted for a maximum of two months were included. The study population was divided into pre-COVID and COVID cohorts. Demographic and usage information between cohorts were compared and usage clusters were identified within each cohort. Differences were tested using Chi-squared, two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests and logit regressions. Results: Of the 624,103 users who joined the service between May 1, 2019, and October 1, 2021, 18,889 (32.81%) met the inclusion criteria: 5,048 in the pre-COVID cohort and 13,841 in the COVID cohort. The COVID cohort wrote more journals; maintained the same focus on messaging practitioners, posting discussions, commenting on posts, and having booked chats; and engaged less in writing journals, setting personal goals, posting articles, and having ad-hoc chats. Four usage profiles were identified in both cohorts: one relatively disengaged, one focused on contacting practitioners through chats/messages, and two broadly interested in writing discussions and comments within the digital community. Despite their broad similarities, usage patterns also exhibited differences between cohorts. For example, all four clusters had over 70% of users attempting to have ad-hoc chats with practitioners in the pre-COVID cohort, compared to one out of four clusters in the COVID cohort. Overall, engagement change patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic were not equal across clusters. Sensitivity analysis revealed varying strength of these defined clusters. Discussion: Our study identified changes in user activity and engagement behavior within a digital mental healthcare service during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that usage patterns within digital mental health services may be susceptible to change in response to external events such as a pandemic. Continuous monitoring of engagement patterns is important for informed design and personalized interventions.",10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1143272,2,Scopus,85167617961,2-s2.0-85167617961,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167617961
"Predictive, Preventive, and Personalized Approach in Sleep Medicine",Richter K.,2023,Advances in Predictive Preventive and Personalised Medicine,"Sleep and individual chronobiologic patterns are associated with the mental and physical health condition of every human being. The development from healthy status, through suboptimal health and at the and to chronical diseases is often associated with irregularities of following five sleep-related outcomes: 1. sleep duration—Totals Sleep time, 2. time needed to fall asleep-Sleep Latency, 3. Frequency of the awakening after getting asleep, 4. Awakening in the early morning time (waking up too early), and the 5. Amount of deep sleep. All these outcomes can vary according to the age, occupation, and the general health condition, whereas the implementation of Prediction, Prevention, and Personalized Medicine (PPPM) Strategy on Sleep disorders could improve the Prediction, Prevention, and the effectivity of the Personalized Treatment approach of the following mental health conditions: Depression, Suicidality, and the Mental Health of the Adolescents especially internet addiction and many others. Target Predicting, prevention, and personalized treatment of patients with OSA can help reducing the risk factors for the most frequently and epidemiological relevant health conditions as arterial hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. For successfully implementation of the PPPM Strategy on Sleep and chronobiology, the artificial intelligence methods, machine learning and Sleep Omics can be used on big sleep data from digital platforms and wearables, generating automatically recommendation for exactly recognition of the sleep risk factors, early prevention, and personalized treatment of the different phenotypes of sleep disturbances with more frequently use of telemedicine in the next future.",10.1007/978-3-031-34884-6_14,1,Scopus,85176554345,2-s2.0-85176554345,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176554345

They can get closer in the real time. With more than 237 million daily active users [1], Twitter allows sharing short messages named « tweets ». Some users can employ offensive words, pictures or videos against another person via electronic devices. This phenomenon is calling cyberbullying. Because of timid, fear or weak cyberbullying attacks teens in darkness. Victims suffer in silence and can be driven to lower self-esteem, depression or suicide. In that aims many researches in computer science, sociology and psychiatry take the challenge and many initiatives are developed in order to detect offensive, abusive and negative comments.Because of the huge number of users, the tweets make a raw dataset containing a lot of information that must be purified.

Assessing Mood With the Identifying Depression Early in Adolescence Chatbot (IDEABot): Development and Implementation Study,Viduani A.,2023,Jmir Human Factors,"Background: Mental health status assessment is mostly limited to clinical or research settings, but recent technological advances provide new opportunities for measurement using more ecological approaches. Leveraging apps already in use by individuals on their smartphones, such as chatbots, could be a useful approach to capture subjective reports of mood in the moment. Objective: This study aimed to describe the development and implementation of the Identifying Depression Early in Adolescence Chatbot (IDEABot), a WhatsApp-based tool designed for collecting intensive longitudinal data on adolescents’ mood. Methods: The IDEABot was developed to collect data from Brazilian adolescents via WhatsApp as part of the Identifying Depression Early in Adolescence Risk Stratified Cohort (IDEA-RiSCo) study. It supports the administration and collection of self-reported structured items or questionnaires and audio responses. The development explored WhatsApp’s default features, such as emojis and recorded audio messages, and focused on scripting relevant and acceptable conversations. The IDEABot supports 5 types of interactions: textual and audio questions, administration of a version of the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, unprompted interactions, and a snooze function. Six adolescents (n=4, 67% male participants and n=2, 33% female participants) aged 16 to 18 years tested the initial version of the IDEABot and were engaged to codevelop the final version of the app. The IDEABot was subsequently used for data collection in the second- and third-year follow-ups of the IDEA-RiSCo study. Results: The adolescents assessed the initial version of the IDEABot as enjoyable and made suggestions for improvements that were subsequently implemented. The IDEABot’s final version follows a structured script with the choice of answer based on exact text matches throughout 15 days. The implementation of the IDEABot in 2 waves of the IDEA-RiSCo sample (140 and 132 eligible adolescents in the second- and third-year follow-ups, respectively) evidenced adequate engagement indicators, with good acceptance for using the tool (113/140, 80.7% and 122/132, 92.4% for second- and third-year follow-up use, respectively), low attrition (only 1/113, 0.9% and 1/122, 0.8%, respectively, failed to engage in the protocol after initial interaction), and high compliance in terms of the proportion of responses in relation to the total number of elicited prompts (12.8, SD 3.5; 91% out of 14 possible interactions and 10.57, SD 3.4; 76% out of 14 possible interactions, respectively). Conclusions: The IDEABot is a frugal app that leverages an existing app already in daily use by our target population. It follows a simple rule-based approach that can be easily tested and implemented in diverse settings and possibly diminishes the burden of intensive data collection for participants by repurposing WhatsApp. In this context, the IDEABot appears as an acceptable and potentially scalable tool for gathering momentary information that can enhance our understanding of mood fluctuations and development.",10.2196/44388,13,Scopus,85169415373,2-s2.0-85169415373,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169415373
Personality Analysis Based on The Handwriting Shape using Integration of Image Processing and Machine Learning Algorithm,Rosalina ,2023,Proceedings of the 7th 2023 International Conference on New Media Studies Conmedia 2023,"In Indonesia, mental health awareness is not as prominent as physical health, and many adolescents have experienced mental health problems. Some people hide their mental and emotional problems by appearing cheerful and peaceful, but research shows that body language and voice tone can reveal a person's inner psychological state.

Cyberbullying Detection and Severity Determination Model,Obaid M.H.,2023,IEEE Access,"Some teenagers actively participate in cyberbullying, which is a pattern of online harassment of others. Many teenagers are unaware of the risks posed by cyberbullying, which can include depression, self-harm, and suicide. Because of the serious harm it can cause to a person's mental health, cyberbullying is an important problem that needs to be addressed. This research aimed to develop a technique to identify the severity of bullying using a deep learning algorithm and fuzzy logic. In this task, Twitter data (47,733 comments) from Kaggle were processed and analyzed to flag cyberbullying comments. The comments embedded by Keras were fed into a long short-term memory network, composed of four layers, for classification. After that, fuzzy logic was applied to determine the severity of the comments.

Evaluation of Convolution and Attention Networks for Nudity and Pornography Detection in Sketch Images,Momo M.A.,2023,2023 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Informatics Isci 2023,"Internet has become a main source of information for people in numerous areas. However, internet can be useful or harmful according to types of contents exposed. When the visual sexual and violent contents are available, the danger targets children and youths and causes a damage in their mental health. Consequently, content moderators are required to be employed in all websites and social media platforms. Several companies involve human to review, filter, and edit visual sexual and violent contents. However, manual reviewing and filtering is costly and tough. Therefore, big companies such as Amazon and Microsoft used machine learning based solutions to automate the content moderation process. This paper proposes a new solution for content moderation that targets sketch images specifically. Three state of the art models including EfficientNetB7 convolutional neural network (CNN), vision transformer, and convolution and attention (CoAtNet) have been employed for this task to detect nudity and pornography in sketch images.

With an eye towards creating early warning systems for the anticipation of harmful comments vulnerable to attacks, we investigate the detection of cyberbullying in social networks. Online harassment disturbs by cyberbullying has grave repercussions. The ability to automatically detect cyberbullying and recognize the roles that individuals assume in social interaction is required to address this issue in online contexts. The use of technology as a bullying tool is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a problem that has arisen along with technology development and poses a risk to adolescents' psychological welfare. A framework is suggested to provide two distinct descriptions of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a significant issue on the internet that affects both adults and teenagers.

Effi-Emp: An AI Based Approach Towards Positive Empathic Expressions,Rafi R.H.,2023,Lecture Notes in Computer Science Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics,"Recently due to the advent of the Web, the ubiquity of search engines, and the widespread use of social media, the modern world has been witnessing technologies that can mimic human behavior. With the rise of Internet usage among youth and the prevalence of cyberbullying, mental health has become a global issue. It is one of the great convictions that newer technologies can also make a valuable contribution to creating an efficient and empathic model which will depend less on computation power and provide the same output as bigger models. This paper presents a novel approach to address a fundamental mental health aspect by leveraging knowledge distillation to generate positive and highly empathic feedback. The proposed method “Effi-Emp”, is a hybrid approach that utilizes transformers and attention layers to generate empathic dialogues which closely mimic human dialogues. Sentence coherence and rate of change during sentence generation have been given special attention so that the model generates high-quality empathic sentences. By utilizing the last layer of the model Knowledge Distillation was achieved with about 20% improved run time in comparison with the State-of-Art model. Automatic and baseline evaluation methods demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms all other models by a decent margin.",10.1007/978-3-031-46674-8_40,0,Scopus,85177441377,2-s2.0-85177441377,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177441377
Prediction of Adolescent Depression Relapse Events Using Fusion of Actigraphy and Ecological Momentary Assessment Features,Lucasius C.,2023,5th IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics Cognition and Machine Learning Applications Icccmla 2023,"The objective of this study is to explore the application of machine learning (ML) for the prediction of relapse events in adolescents suffering from Major Depressive Disorder using actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. The data were collected from 114 adolescents aged between 12 and 21 who were participating in a depression research study at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. They made up to 8 visits where a psychiatrist would assess their level of depression by conducting a Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) survey. Between visits, participants wore the GeneActiv wearable device to provide actigraphy data and also answered survey questions to provide EMA data. Any subject that experienced one visit with a CDRS score of less than 40 followed by another visit with a score of greater than 40 was labelled as undergoing a relapse event. Various ML methods including support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks in combination with fusion methods were used to predict relapse events. After training the above methods on 67% of the participants and testing them on the remaining ones, it was determined that feature fusion techniques applied to actigraphy and EMA metrics produced the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72. Another novel technique combining raw actigraphy counts with the aforementioned metrics yielded areas of up to 0.65. Overall, the results show that there is much promise that can be held in the integration of digital phenotypes for the prediction of relapse events in adolescents.",10.1109/ICCCMLA58983.2023.10346863,3,Scopus,85182509405,2-s2.0-85182509405,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182509405

Influence of Pokémon GO on Physical Activity and Psychosocial Well-Being in Children and Adolescents: Systematic Review,Liang H.,2023,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Pokémon GO, an augmented reality game with widespread popularity, can potentially influence players’ physical activity (PA) levels and psychosocial well-being. Objective: This review aims to systematically examine the scientific evidence regarding the impact of Pokémon GO on PA and psychosocial well-being in children and adolescents. Methods: Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) framework, we conducted keyword and reference searches in the PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. We performed title and abstract screening, full-text review, evidence synthesis, and identified research gaps. Results: Our review included 10 studies that explored the effect of Pokémon GO on PA or psychosocial well-being among children and adolescents. These studies used diverse designs across multiple countries and regions. Pokémon GO use measures encompassed frequency, experience, adherence, and motivation. PA assessment methods ranged from self-reported questionnaires to technology-based evaluations and qualitative approaches. Psychosocial well-being measures included emotional intelligence, personal well-being, self-control, emotionality, and sociability. In general, the estimated impact of Pokémon GO on PA was positive, with gaming elements and engagement correlating with increased PA levels. However, the effect on psychosocial well-being presented mixed results, with positive associations for sociability but a complex relationship involving well-being and internet gaming disorder. The limitations of these studies comprised the absence of randomized controlled trials, heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, and potential confounding bias. Conclusions: Overall, Pokémon GO tends to positively affect PA levels, while the impact on psychosocial well-being remains complex and requires further investigation. Future research should investigate the mechanisms connecting Pokémon GO use with PA and psychosocial well-being and the potential risks of excessive gameplay. These findings can help inform public health interventions to harness gaming technologies for promoting PA and enhancing well-being among the younger generation.",10.2196/49019,13,Scopus,85176789588,2-s2.0-85176789588,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176789588
A targeted strategic peer support intervention to increase adherence to video teletherapy exposure and response prevention treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a retrospective observational analysis,Murphy C.E.,2023,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,"Exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, is a first-line, evidence-based treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) for adults and children. It is effective for the majority of those who engage in it, but treatment adherence can be challenging for some due to the stress involved in the treatment as well as different life circumstances that arise. To help improve treatment adherence, NOCD, a provider of video teletherapy ERP, identifies those at risk of non-adherence using a prediction algorithm trained on a data set of N = 13,809 and provides targeted peer support interventions by individuals (“Member Advocates”) who successfully completed ERP treatment for OCD. Member Advocates, using lived OCD experience as well as experience with ERP, engage at-risk patients through digital messaging to engage, educate, and encourage patients in the early stages of treatment. From June 2022 to August 2022, N = 815 patients deemed at risk were reached out to and n = 251 responded and engaged with the Member Advocates. In the at-risk patients who engaged, the intervention resulted in a significant mean 30.4% more therapy hours completed compared to those who did not engage. Additionally, engaged patients had greater reductions in OCD severity. These results have implications for how data science, digital interventions, and strategic peer-to-peer communication and support can be combined to enhance the effectiveness of treatment.",10.3389/fnhum.2023.1251194,1,Scopus,85176429476,2-s2.0-85176429476,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176429476
Deep Learning Approach for Measuring the Severity of Depression Using Social Media,Sable N.P.,2023,2023 International Conference on Integration of Computational Intelligent System Icicis 2023,"Depression., one of the world's most common medical illnesses today, has a negative social and financial impact. The emotional computing models concentrate more attention on analyzing specific client postings than chronological conduct patterns, which are essential for spotting changes and improvements in psychological behavior and user behavior. Context, which entails a consistent examination of emotions and traits over time. This article suggests using the TROAD framework to recognize sequential trends over time in depressive user behavior on social media. To recognize sequential patterns from depressive user behavior, the framework determines the optimal interval to analyze each user activity, collects emotional and contextual variables from user input, and models the features into time frames. Today, depression has become a significant issue in our culture. It is a significant contributor to suicide, particularly among teenagers. The nations impacted by the current coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19) have suggested lockdown and social seclusion measures. These policies, which lead to interpersonal isolation, have caused depression and mental health issues to become very major issues.

Psychological Study of Cyber-Bullying Against Adolescent Girls in India Using Twitter,Sharma K.,2023,International Journal of Cyber Behavior Psychology and Learning,"Due to the rise in digital activity of students as well as increased social media presence, the lack of regulation of platforms has given rise to another form of bullying, popularly known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is one of the most adverse issues prevalent in schools nationwide. Cyberbullying refers to bullying that happens over any web-interfaced or electronic platform. It is an activity that significantly affects the mental and physical health of its victims. With increased secrecy, the frequency and propagation of cyberbullying remain high due to the information technology infrastructure available today. Understanding cyberbullying trends and preventing them, using suitable machine learning algorithms, could help numerous school students lead better lives, as well as make better decisions, which help them grow and flourish into capable future leaders. Hence, the authors’ aim for this research paper is to focus on adolescent girls using various tools and techniques like text analytics and image analytics. For this paper, the authors study a sample of netizens. The location where the analysis is conducted is New Delhi, and the real-world data is extracted from Twitter in English. The real-world data is extracted using appropriate data mining algorithms to find hidden patterns and then conduct the analyses required to understand the psychology of girls and boys and the tonality and voice of the tweets/posts. This is done from the open-source information available on the platform (Twitter) from tweets by the users. There is little to no bias as the entire process can be automated; hence, tweets will be filtered or flagged based on data. Such a method allows one to get access to unbiased data. Bias, in this case, can be defined as prejudice in action and response received from a participant. The results are then analysed using polarity and subjectivity. Understanding psychology and personality traits helps in drawing insights from the expressions collected. The authors will be studying the sample bios, likes, and comments of the sample using a lexical and syntactical approach. Six thousand top tweets are extracted, and the 15 tweets which score the highest on polarity and subjectivity values are taken for further analysis. The tweets are filtered based on 16 responses from a focus group filtering the 20 most popular profane words. Since the data is extracted using Twitter (i.e., a secondary data source), the authors address the gap in current psychological analyses. In such studies, one usually circulates questionnaires to understand the participant, but, for this research though, the authors will be studying the data without bringing the concerned individual into play, thereby eliminating the human bias, which is a significant limitation of gathering responses through a questionnaire. There is increased scope for further streamlining the model. The inferences include understanding the regulation of a social media platform, the degree of aggression on the platform, and an effort to distinguish those who cause such aggression.",10.4018/IJCBPL.327867,3,Scopus,85169815517,2-s2.0-85169815517,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169815517
Influencing factors and risk prediction modeling of maternal postpartum depression: a cross-sectional study in Chinese puerperal women of sitting the month,Su X.,2023,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Objective: This study aims to investigate the occurrence of maternal postpartum depression (PPD) during menstruation and analyze the influencing factors and risk prediction modeling of maternal PPD in Chinese puerperal women of sitting the month. Methods: A total of 286 mothers were selected using convenience sampling, who came for a routine postpartum follow-up visit were surveyed, including face-to-face, telephone, and online. They completed questionnaires including the basic profile questionnaire, Postpartum Partner Support Scale (PPSS), Edinburgh PPD Scale (EPDS), Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale (SICS), and Simple Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), who were advised to complete the survey alone, in private, reducing the impact of husband<sup>’</sup>s presence on the quality of the questionnaire. Variables showing statistical significance in the one-way analysis were further analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The predictive value of the logistic regression model was analyzed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), and the predictive reliability was expressed as the area under the ROC [Area Under the Curve (AUC)]. Results: The total score of PPD was 7.78 ± 4.57, and 22 people (7.69%) experienced depression during the postpartum period. PPD was found to be correlated with postpartum partner support, positive coping, negative coping, and parenting self-efficacy, with correlation coefficient values of −0.63, 0.62, 0.56, and − 0.70, respectively (all p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that postpartum partner support and parenting self-efficacy were independent factors influencing PPD, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 0.76 (0.61 ~ 0.94) and 0.83 (0.75 ~ 0.93), respectively both p < 0.05.The area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity for postpartum partner support and parenting self-efficacy were 1.00 (95% confidence intervals 0.99 ~ 1.00), 99.24, and 90.91%.

Identifying Severity of Cyberbullying Using Scalable Labeled Multi-Platform Dataset,Vyawahare M.,2022,International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering,"Increasing invective posts on online social media platforms is of great concern considering the wellbeing of society and psychological health of youth. These invective posts many times take the form of cyberbullying if not tackled in an early stage. It is required to identify such posts which are harmful and may become even more dangerous for any netizens, to maintain a psychologically healthy society. Many machine learning and deep learning based systems were designed in the past for automated cyberbullying detection. Accurate and precise cyberbullying detection needs a large and correctly annotated dataset. The work is focused on resolving the issue of unavailability of appropriate dataset by designing an automated labeling system for creating and labeling the dataset to detect severity of cyberbullying. The meta-features apart from textual comments like semantic and syntactic features also contribute to learning of the machine. Principal components analysis is used for feature extraction and reduction. Rule based methodology is designed, developed and implemented which considers textual, semantic and syntactic features and results in a rich in features, multi-platform, multi-label dataset for severity of cyberbullying detection as well as cyberbullying prediction. Till now only two approaches have been used for Annotation of dataset: Manual labeling and filtration method. A new rule based automated approach is proposed and implemented in this work. Using this new approach the dataset of size 17 lakh entries with 5 labels is prepared and used for training the machines. To make the dataset standardized and usable for researchers in future, it is tested and verified with various methods. Evaluation of the proposed system based on accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure demonstrates that the performance of multiclass classification trained from the prepared dataset is highly improved.",,2,Scopus,85164822434,2-s2.0-85164822434,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164822434
Self-Supervised Interest Recommendation Based Intelligent System Design on Mental Health Education,He M.,2022,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Mental health education plays an important role for psychological health of college students. It is worth exploring how to effectively carry out mental health education online courses, give full play to the advantages of online courses. With the rapid development of robotics and intelligent control technology, online education can be completed depending on different intelligent devices. However, it is still a challenge to implement better online education programs on multiple intelligent devices and even educational robots. To solve this challenge, combining the artificial intelligence and intelligent control technologies, we propose a self-supervised interest recommendation based intelligent system design, which can be applied to mental health education and easily adapted to different intelligent devices. In particular, we introduce a self-supervised method to capture the students' interests when they learn about the mental health courses, and reinforce their knowledge by recommending top-K courses that are likely to interest them most.

Physical fitness changes in adolescents due to social distancing during the coronavirus disease pandemic in Korea,Lee K.J.,2022,Peerj,"Background. At least 60 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per day is recommended for physical and mental health of adolescents. Schools are one of the most suitable places for promoting students’ health as it is a place where vigorous physical activity occurs. However, the physical activity of students is threatened because schools are closed worldwide owing to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the physical fitness changes in 27,782 Korean adolescents during the pandemic and present alternative education and health policies to the school. Methods. We included 29,882 middle school students (age: 13–15 years; males: 14,941, females: 12,841) in Korea from 2019 to 2021 . Participants’ physical fitness at school was measured using the physical activity promotion system (PAPS) manual developed to measure students’ physical fitness. Physical fitness variables included body mass index (BMI), 20 m shuttle run, handgrip strength, sit-and-reach, and 50 m run. Results. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the BMI and cardiorespiratory endurance of Korean middle school students. Specifically, male students’ BMI increased, while body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, and grip strength decreased significantly. Female students showed significant decreases in BMI and sit-and-reach test scores. It is clear that the physical fitness level of adolescents decreased by a greater degree after the COVID-19 pandemic than before, and the decrease in the physical fitness level of male students was noticeable. Therefore, a lesson strategy should be prepared that considers the contents and methods of physical education classes to improve the physical fitness level of male and female adolescents. Conclusions. Fitness-based classes suitable for online methods should be urgently added as alternative physical education classes to prepare for the second COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, it is necessary to create an environment in which physical activity is a possibility in physical education classes, in any situation using artificial intelligence and virtual reality.",10.7717/peerj.14494,6,Scopus,85145385650,2-s2.0-85145385650,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145385650
Students' Views on Intelligent Agents as Assistive Tools for Dealing with Stress and Anxiety in Social Situations,Rasouli S.,2022,Hai 2022 Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Human Agent Interaction,"Mental health problems are on the rise among university students. Many students face overwhelming stress and anxiety when participating in different activities and interacting with peers, which can affect their performance and mental well-being. However, many are unlikely to seek or receive help. Intelligent agents can offer the possibility of delivering health and mental well-being interventions with the aim of extending and complementing mental health interventions and increasing accessibility. To provide efficient interventions for students, it is imperative to identify design elements and functionalities that are most effective for engaging students. In this paper, we conducted an online survey with 85 participants (undergraduate and graduate students) to investigate preferences for using intelligent agents (e.g., conversational agents, social robots, etc.) to support their mental well-being, specifically to deal with feelings of stress and anxiety in social situations that are common in academic contexts. We asked students to complete a questionnaire in order to explore students' experience of anxiety and their perceptions of different aspects of intelligent agents in the context of managing anxiety. The results provide insights on different social and technical capabilities as well as design elements that need to be considered when developing intelligent agents to help address stress and anxiety among university students.",10.1145/3527188.3561932,9,Scopus,85144609197,2-s2.0-85144609197,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144609197
University students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a consensus statement from the UK Adult ADHD Network (UKAAN),Sedgwick-Müller J.A.,2022,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor educational outcomes that can have long-term negative effects on the mental health, wellbeing, and socio-economic outcomes of university students. Mental health provision for university students with ADHD is often inadequate due to long waiting times for access to diagnosis and treatment in specialist National Health Service (NHS) clinics. ADHD is a hidden and marginalised disability, and within higher education in the UK, the categorisation of ADHD as a specific learning difference (or difficulty) may be contributing to this. Aims: This consensus aims to provide an informed understanding of the impact of ADHD on the educational (or academic) outcomes of university students and highlight an urgent need for timely access to treatment and management. Methods: The UK Adult ADHD Network (UKAAN) convened a meeting of practitioners and experts from England, Wales, and Scotland, to discuss issues that university students with ADHD can experience or present with during their programme of studies and how best to address them. A report on the collective analysis, evaluation, and opinions of the expert panel and published literature about the impact of ADHD on the educational outcomes of university students is presented. Results: A consensus was reached that offers expert advice, practical guidance, and recommendations to support the medical, education, and disability practitioners working with university students with ADHD. Conclusions: Practical advice, guidance, and recommendations based on expert consensus can inform the identification of ADHD in university students, personalised interventions, and educational support, as well as contribute to existing research in this topic area. There is a need to move away from prevailing notions within higher education about ADHD being a specific learning difference (or difficulty) and attend to the urgent need for university students with ADHD to have timely access to treatment and support. A multimodal approach can be adapted to support university students with ADHD. This approach would view timely access to treatment, including reasonable adjustments and educational support, as having a positive impact on the academic performance and achievement of university students with ADHD.",10.1186/s12888-022-03898-z,44,Scopus,85128751679,2-s2.0-85128751679,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128751679
Study protocol for pragmatic trials of Internet-delivered guided and unguided cognitive behavior therapy for treating depression and anxiety in university students of two Latin American countries: the Yo Puedo Sentirme Bien study,Benjet C.,2022,Trials,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are highly prevalent among university students and predict impaired college performance and later life role functioning. Yet most students do not receive treatment, especially in low-middle-income countries (LMICs). We aim to evaluate the effects of expanding treatment using scalable and inexpensive Internet-delivered transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) among college students with symptoms of MDD and/or GAD in two LMICs in Latin America (Colombia and Mexico) and to investigate the feasibility of creating a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict for whom iCBT is most effective. Methods: We will first carry out a multi-site randomized pragmatic clinical trial (N = 1500) of students seeking treatment at student mental health clinics in participating universities or responding to an email offering services. Students on wait lists for clinic services will be randomized to unguided iCBT (33%), guided iCBT (33%), and treatment as usual (TAU) (33%). iCBT will be provided immediately whereas TAU will be whenever a clinic appointment is available. Short-term aggregate effects will be assessed at 90 days and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will use ensemble machine learning to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of unguided versus guided iCBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to optimize individual student outcome. We will then conduct a second and third trial with separate samples (n = 500 per arm), but with unequal allocation across two arms: 25% will be assigned to the treatment determined to yield optimal outcomes based on the PTR developed in the first trial (PTR for optimal short-term outcomes for Trial 2 and 12-month outcomes for Trial 3), whereas the remaining 75% will be assigned with equal allocation across all three treatment arms. Discussion: By collecting comprehensive baseline characteristics to evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effects, we will provide valuable and innovative information to optimize treatment effects and guide university mental health treatment planning. Such an effort could have enormous public-health implications for the region by increasing the reach of treatment, decreasing unmet need and clinic wait times, and serving as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation.

Automatic depression screening using social interaction data on smartphones,Ware S.,2022,Smart Health,"Depression is a serious and prevalent mental illness. The ubiquitous adoption of smartphones have enabled new opportunities for depression screening. Recently studies have used physical location and activity information automatically collected on smartphones for depression prediction. Social interactions also play a vital role in the overall health and well-being of individuals. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using social interaction data, specifically SMS and phone call logs, collected on smartphones for predicting depression. We extract a comprehensive set of features from such data. In addition, we construct a family of machine learning models by using these features for depression prediction. Using the social interaction data collected via an Android phone app from college-age students, we compare the characteristics of SMS and phone call usage patterns between depressed and non-depressed participants. We find that they exhibit more distinguishing behaviors in outgoing SMS messages and phone calls, which are initiated by the users, than incoming SMS messages and phone calls. Our results also demonstrate that social interaction data can be used to predict depression effectively, with F<inf>1</inf> score as high as 0.82.",10.1016/j.smhl.2022.100356,9,Scopus,85141982944,2-s2.0-85141982944,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141982944
Group-tailored feedback on online mental health screening for university students: using cluster analysis,Lee S.,2022,BMC Primary Care,"Background: The method by which mental health screening result reports are given affects the user’s health behavior. Lists with the distribution of scores in various mental health areas is difficult for users to understand, and if the results are negative, they may feel more embarrassed than necessary. Therefore, we propose using group-tailored feedback, grouping people of similar mental health types by cluster analysis for comprehensive explanations of multidimensional mental health. Methods: This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted using a qualitative approach based on cluster analysis. Data were collected via a developed mental screening website, with depression, anxiety, sleep problems, perfectionism, procrastination, and attention assessed for 2 weeks in January 2020 in Korea. Participants were randomly recruited, and sample size was 174. Total was divided into 25 with severe depression/anxiety (SDA+) and 149 without severe depression/anxiety (SDA-) according to the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 criteria. Cluster analysis was conducted in each group, and an ANOVA was performed to find significant clusters. Thereafter, structured discussion was performed with mental health professionals to define the features of the clusters and construct the feedback content initially. Thirteen expert counselors were interviewed to reconstruct the content and validate the effectiveness of the developed feedback. Results: SDA- was divided into 3 using the k-means algorithm, which showed the best performance (silhouette score = 0.32, CH score = 91.67) among the clustering methods. Perfectionism and procrastination were significant factors in discretizing the groups. SDA+ subgroups were integrated because only 25 people belonged to this group, and they need professional help rather than self-care. Mental status and treatment recommendations were determined for each group, and group names were assigned to represent their features. The developed feedback was assessed to improve mental health literacy (MHL) through integrative and understandable explanations of multidimensional mental health. Moreover, it appeared that a sense of belonging was induced to reduce reluctance to face the feedback. Conclusions: This study suggests group-tailored feedback using cluster analysis, which identifies groups of university students by integrating multidimensions of mental health. These methods can help students increase their interest in mental health and improve MHL to enable timely help.",10.1186/s12875-021-01622-6,10,Scopus,85123615848,2-s2.0-85123615848,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123615848
"A Novel Smart Belt for Anxiety Detection, Classification, and Reduction Using IIoMT on Students’ Cardiac Signal and MSY",Pal R.,2022,Bioengineering,"The prevalence of anxiety among university students is increasing, resulting in the negative impact on their academic and social (behavioral and emotional) development. In order for students to have competitive academic performance, the cognitive function should be strengthened by detecting and handling anxiety. Over a period of 6 weeks, this study examined how to detect anxiety and how Mano Shakti Yoga (MSY) helps reduce anxiety. Relying on cardiac signals, this study follows an integrated detection-estimation-reduction framework for anxiety using the Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) and MSY. IIoMT is the integration of Internet of Medical Things (wearable smart belt) and machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost (AB)). Sixty-six eligible students were selected as experiencing anxiety detected based on the results of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) questionnaire and a smart belt. Then, the students were divided randomly into two groups: experimental and control. The experimental group followed an MSY intervention for one hour twice a week, while the control group followed their own daily routine. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the data obtained from the smart belt. MSY is an alternative improvement for the immune system that helps reduce anxiety. All the results illustrate that the experimental group reduced anxiety with a significant (p < 0.05) difference in group × time interaction compared to the control group. The intelligent techniques achieved maximum accuracy of 80% on using RF algorithm. Thus, students can practice MSY and concentrate on their objectives by improving their intelligence, attention, and memory.",10.3390/bioengineering9120793,25,Scopus,85144668438,2-s2.0-85144668438,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144668438
Longitudinal Predictors of Perceived Climate Change Importance and Worry among Italian Youths: A Machine Learning Approach,Prati G.,2022,Sustainability Switzerland,"The current study aimed to investigate the longitudinal predictors of perceived importance of climate change and personal worry among Italian youths. Specifically, we used machine learning techniques to examine the predictive importance of a wide range of socio-demographic factors, political perceptions, attitudes on a national and European level (identity, attitudes, tolerance, support for democracy, authoritarianism, nationalism, political trust), efficacy beliefs, social well-being, political interest, and different forms of participation on perceived importance of climate change and personal worry. In this longitudinal study, we collected data using a questionnaire in two waves at a one-year interval—in 2016 and 2017. Participants were 1288 Italian young adults (61.3% were female; 38.7% were male) whose mean age was 19.18 (SD = 3.29) ranging between 15 and 30 years. Breiman’s random forest algorithm performed better than Friedman’s gradient boosting machines algorithm. The random forest algorithm revealed that age, tolerance toward migrants, and tolerance toward refugees were the most important predictors of perceived importance of climate change and personal worry. Other important predictors were national/European identity, political interest, internal political efficacy, nationalism, social well-being, self-efficacy, authoritarianism, anti-democratic attitudes, EU warmth, and online and civic participation.",10.3390/su142315716,6,Scopus,85143679290,2-s2.0-85143679290,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143679290
Effect of smartphone app-based health care intervention for health management of high-risk mothers: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,Kim B.,2022,Trials,"Background: The 4th Industrial Revolution with the advent of the smart era, in which artificial intelligence, such as big data analysis and machine learning, is expected, and the provision of healthcare services using smartphones has become a reality. In particular, high-risk mothers who experience gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and prenatal and postpartum depression are highly likely to have adverse effects on the mother and newborn due to the disease. Therefore, continuous observation and intervention in health management are needed to prevent diseases and promote healthy behavior for a healthy life. Methods: This randomized controlled trial will provide mothers 18 years of age or older with health care information collected based on evidence-based literature data using a smartphone app for 6 weeks. About 500 mothers will be selected in consideration of the dropout rate due to the characteristics of mothers. The study group and control group will be computer-generated in a 1:1 ratio through random assignment. The research group will receive health management items through the app, and health management information suitable for the pregnancy cycle is pushed to an alarm. The control group will receive the health management information of the paper. We also followed the procedure for developing mobile apps using the IDEAS framework. Discussion: These results show the effectiveness of smart medical healthcare services and promote changes in health behaviors throughout pregnancy in high-risk mothers. Trial registration: Clinical trial registration information for this study has been registered with WHO ICTRP and CRIS (Korea Clinical Research Information Service, CRIS).

Unobtrusive Cardio-Respiratory Assessment for Different Indoor Environmental Conditions,Rodrigues M.C.J.,2022,IEEE Sensors Journal,"The achievement of a healthy indoor environ-ment-an indispensable requirement for human well-being-relies on the establishment of good air quality conditions and thermal comfort levels. This study addresses the development of a healthcare-focused Internet-of-Things (IoT) system for the cardiac assessment using photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) that can be applied in any indoor environment. Results from its experimental application include the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory status from a group of young adults under different thermal conditions and relative humidity (RH) levels. The final goal was to investigate the effects of short-term exposure to different air temperature and humidity conditions on human thermal comfort based on the analysis of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. The experiment took place in a regular and nonisothermal office environment. Simulations based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were conducted to estimate heat distribution and select the optimal locations for the environmental sensor nodes' placement. Results indicated that activation of the parasympathetic system was more notable in short-term exposures to environments with different air temperatures (24 °C-30 °C) than with different levels of RH (50%-70%). Changes in ambient air temperature led to the activation of thermal regulatory reflexes and thermal discomfort, perceived by an increase in the ratio of low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF) at higher air temperature exposures. In addition, HRV parameters were used to train machine learning models on predicting if the user is in a thermally comfortable environment or a discomfortable environment (hot or humid), having achieved an 87% average accuracy.",10.1109/JSEN.2022.3207522,7,Scopus,85141524674,2-s2.0-85141524674,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141524674
Digital health tools for the passive monitoring of depression: a systematic review of methods,De Angel V.,2022,Npj Digital Medicine,"The use of digital tools to measure physiological and behavioural variables of potential relevance to mental health is a growing field sitting at the intersection between computer science, engineering, and clinical science. We summarised the literature on remote measuring technologies, mapping methodological challenges and threats to reproducibility, and identified leading digital signals for depression. Medical and computer science databases were searched between January 2007 and November 2019. Published studies linking depression and objective behavioural data obtained from smartphone and wearable device sensors in adults with unipolar depression and healthy subjects were included. A descriptive approach was taken to synthesise study methodologies. We included 51 studies and found threats to reproducibility and transparency arising from failure to provide comprehensive descriptions of recruitment strategies, sample information, feature construction and the determination and handling of missing data. The literature is characterised by small sample sizes, short follow-up duration and great variability in the quality of reporting, limiting the interpretability of pooled results. Bivariate analyses show consistency in statistically significant associations between depression and digital features from sleep, physical activity, location, and phone use data. Machine learning models found the predictive value of aggregated features. Given the pitfalls in the combined literature, these results should be taken purely as a starting point for hypothesis generation. Since this research is ultimately aimed at informing clinical practice, we recommend improvements in reporting standards including consideration of generalisability and reproducibility, such as wider diversity of samples, thorough reporting methodology and the reporting of potential bias in studies with numerous features.",10.1038/s41746-021-00548-8,131,Scopus,85122780529,2-s2.0-85122780529,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122780529
Predicting self-harm and suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: a nationwide survey report,Liem A.,2022,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: It is estimated that 77.0% of suicide cases occurred in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), which would increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic inequity. However, there is lack of reports on this topic from LMICs, especially during the pandemic. Therefore, this nationwide study aimed to explore self-harm and suicide ideation and its predictive variables during the pandemic in Indonesia as a MIC with the highest COVID-19 fatality rate in Asia. Methods: Non-random sampling online survey was conducted nationwide between 25 May and 16 June 2021. The collected data were demographic variables (i.e. age group), loneliness from social isolation using The UCLA Loneliness Scale Six Items (ULS-6), and self-harm and suicide ideation using item 9 of The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Predictive model was analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression. Results: A total of 5211 participants from all 34 provinces in Indonesia completed the survey. Among 39.3% of them reported self-harm and suicide ideation during the pandemic, which significantly correlated with loneliness. The predictive variables associated with the likelihood of self-harm and suicide ideation were age, residence, job, religion, sex-gender, sexual orientation, HIV status, disability status, and loneliness. The predictive model showed a significant goodness-of-fit to the observed data (x<sup>2</sup> [(15)] = 1803.46, p <.001), R<inf>N</inf><sup>2</sup> =.40. Conclusion: Four out of 10 Indonesians experienced self-harm and suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly people within the age range of 18–24, living in the Java Island, unemployed/student/retired and freelancer, women, members of minority and marginalized communities, and experience of loneliness during the pandemic.",10.1186/s12888-022-03944-w,19,Scopus,85128990748,2-s2.0-85128990748,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128990748
Cross-Platform Detection of Psychiatric Hospitalization via Social Media Data: Comparison Study,Nguyen V.C.,2022,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Previous research has shown the feasibility of using machine learning models trained on social media data from a single platform (eg, Facebook or Twitter) to distinguish individuals either with a diagnosis of mental illness or experiencing an adverse outcome from healthy controls. However, the performance of such models on data from novel social media platforms unseen in the training data (eg, Instagram and TikTok) has not been investigated in previous literature. Objective: Our study examined the feasibility of building machine learning classifiers that can effectively predict an upcoming psychiatric hospitalization given social media data from platforms unseen in the classifiers’ training data despite the preliminary evidence on identity fragmentation on the investigated social media platforms. Methods: Windowed timeline data of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder before a known hospitalization event and healthy controls were gathered from 3 platforms: Facebook (254/268, 94.8% of participants), Twitter (51/268, 19% of participants), and Instagram (134/268, 50% of participants). We then used a 3 × 3 combinatorial binary classification design to train machine learning classifiers and evaluate their performance on testing data from all available platforms. We further compared results from models in intraplatform experiments (ie, training and testing data belonging to the same platform) to those from models in interplatform experiments (ie, training and testing data belonging to different platforms). Finally, we used Shapley Additive Explanation values to extract the top predictive features to explain and compare the underlying constructs that predict hospitalization on each platform. Results: We found that models in intraplatform experiments on average achieved an F<inf>1</inf>-score of 0.72 (SD 0.07) in predicting a psychiatric hospitalization because of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, which is 68% higher than the average of models in interplatform experiments at an F<inf>1</inf>-score of 0.428 (SD 0.11). When investigating the key drivers for divergence in construct validities between models, an analysis of top features for the intraplatform models showed both low predictive feature overlap between the platforms and low pairwise rank correlation (<0.1) between the platforms’ top feature rankings. Furthermore, low average cosine similarity of data between platforms within participants in comparison with the same measurement on data within platforms between participants points to evidence of identity fragmentation of participants between platforms. Conclusions: We demonstrated that models built on one platform’s data to predict critical mental health treatment outcomes such as hospitalization do not generalize to another platform. In our case, this is because different social media platforms consistently reflect different segments of participants’ identities. With the changing ecosystem of social media use among different demographic groups and as web-based identities continue to become fragmented across platforms, further research on holistic approaches to harnessing these diverse data sources is required.",10.2196/39747,6,Scopus,85149963048,2-s2.0-85149963048,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149963048
Artificial intelligence-informed mobile mental health apps for young people: a mixed-methods approach on users’ and stakeholders’ perspectives,Götzl C.,2022,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,"Background: Novel approaches in mobile mental health (mHealth) apps that make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Ecological Momentary Assessments, and Ecological Momentary Interventions have the potential to support young people in the achievement of mental health and wellbeing goals. However, little is known on the perspectives of young people and mental health experts on this rapidly advancing technology. This study aims to investigate the subjective needs, attitudes, and preferences of key stakeholders towards an AI–informed mHealth app, including young people and experts on mHealth promotion and prevention in youth. Methods: We used a convergent parallel mixed–method study design. Two semi–structured online focus groups (n = 8) and expert interviews (n = 5) to explore users and stakeholders perspectives were conducted. Furthermore a representative online survey was completed by young people (n = 666) to investigate attitudes, current use and preferences towards apps for mental health promotion and prevention. Results: Survey results show that more than two-thirds of young people have experience with mHealth apps, and 60% make regular use of 1–2 apps. A minority (17%) reported to feel negative about the application of AI in general, and 19% were negative about the embedding of AI in mHealth apps. This is in line with qualitative findings, where young people displayed rather positive attitudes towards AI and its integration into mHealth apps. Participants reported pragmatic attitudes towards data sharing and safety practices, implying openness to share data if it adds value for users and if the data request is not too intimate, however demanded transparency of data usage and control over personalization. Experts perceived AI-informed mHealth apps as a complementary solution to on–site delivered interventions in future health promotion among young people. Experts emphasized opportunities in regard with low-threshold access through the use of smartphones, and the chance to reach young people in risk situations. Conclusions: The findings of this exploratory study highlight the importance of further participatory development of training components prior to implementation of a digital mHealth training in routine practice of mental health promotion and prevention. Our results may help to guide developments based on stakeholders’ first recommendations for an AI-informed mHealth app.",10.1186/s13034-022-00522-6,42,Scopus,85142269524,2-s2.0-85142269524,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142269524
Perceived barriers to psychiatric help-seeking in South Korea by age groups: text mining analyses of social media big data,Seo H.Y.,2022,BMC Psychiatry,"Background: The psychiatric treatment gap is substantial in Korea, implying barriers in seeking help. Objectives: This study aims to explore barriers of seeing psychiatrists, expressed on the internet by age groups. Methods: A corpus of data was garnered extensively from internet communities, blogs and social network services from 1 January 2016 to 31 July 2019. Among the texts collected, texts containing words linked to psychiatry were selected. Then the corpus was dismantled into words by using natural language processing. Words linked to barriers to seeking help were identified and classified. Then the words from web communities that we were able to identify the age groups were additionally organized by age groups. Results: 97,730,360 articles were identified and 6,097,369 were included in the analysis. Words implying the barriers were selected and classified into four groups of structural discrimination, public prejudice, low accessibility, and adverse drug effects. Structural discrimination was the greatest barrier occupying 34%, followed by public prejudice (27.8%), adverse drug effects (18.6%), and cost/low accessibility (16.1%). In the analysis by age groups, structural discrimination caused teenagers (51%), job seekers (64%) and mothers with children (43%) the most concern. In contrast, the public prejudice (49%) was the greatest barriers in the senior group. Conclusions: Although structural discrimination may most contribute to barriers to visiting psychiatrists in Korea, variation by generations may exist. Along with the general attempt to tackle the discrimination, customized approach might be needed.",10.1186/s12888-022-03969-1,18,Scopus,85130072468,2-s2.0-85130072468,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130072468
Psychological Vulnerability Indices and the Adolescent’s Good Mental Health Factors: A Correlational Study in a Sample of Portuguese Adolescents,Nobre J.,2022,Children,"Background: Psychological vulnerability (PV) indicates the individual’s inability to adapt to stressful situations. Adolescents experience negative impacts on their future mental health if they do not acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to have good mental health during their developmental stage. Aim: To compare the PV index among the three stages of adolescence and to explore the factors involved in good mental health, including the relationship between adolescents’ PV indices and sociodemographic variables, and the relationship between adolescents’ PV index and their knowledge of the factors that characterize good mental health. Method: An exploratory, cross-sectional, correlational study was carried out in three public schools in a region of Portugal, using online self-completed questionnaires: the Psychological Vulnerability Scale (PVS) and the Mental Health-Promoting Knowledge (MHPK-10). Results: Our convenience sample consisted of 260 adolescents, with a mean age of 14.07 years who were students between 5th and 12th grades, mostly female. Moderate PV indexes were obtained that were higher in late adolescence, i.e., in older adolescents, who were females in a more advanced school year, with worse self-perceptions of their physical and mental health and body image, and who frequently used a health service due to mental health problems. The association between the PV index and the level of knowledge about the factors involved in good mental health did not reach a statistical significance (p = 0.06). Conclusions: These results suggest a need for a design of personalized interventions that promote adolescents’ mental health literacy, that prevent PV, and that should be initiated in early adolescence.",10.3390/children9121961,5,Scopus,85144714288,2-s2.0-85144714288,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144714288

From 'Friends with Benefits' to 'Sextortion:' A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents' Online Sexual Risk Experiences,Alsoubai A.,2022,Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction,"Sexual exploration is a natural part of adolescent development; yet, unmediated internet access has enabled teens to engage in a wider variety of potentially riskier sexual interactions than previous generations, from normatively appropriate sexual interactions to sexually abusive situations. Teens have turned to online peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about these experiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts (N=45,955) made by adolescents (ages 13-17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine their online sexual risk experiences. By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of AUC = 0.90) identified posts that contained teen disclosures about online sexual risk experiences and classified the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e., stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience, 2) detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions, and 3) further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners; unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of ""safe""versus ""risky"". Our work provides a deeper understanding of technology-mediated adolescent sexual behaviors from the perspectives of sexual well-being, risk detection, and the prevention of online sexual violence toward youth.",10.1145/3555136,35,Scopus,85146369512,2-s2.0-85146369512,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146369512
An Intelligent Mental Health Identification Method for College Students: A Mixed-Method Study,Li C.,2022,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Purpose: Mental health assessments that combine patients’ facial expressions and behaviors have been proven effective, but screening large-scale student populations for mental health problems is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study aims to provide an efficient and accurate intelligent method for further psychological diagnosis and treatment, which combines artificial intelligence technologies to assist in evaluating the mental health problems of college students. Materials and Methods: We propose a mixed-method study of mental health assessment that combines psychological questionnaires with facial emotion analysis to comprehensively evaluate the mental health of students on a large scale. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21(DASS-21) is used for the psychological questionnaire. The facial emotion recognition model is implemented by transfer learning based on neural networks, and the model is pre-trained using FER2013 and CFEE datasets. Among them, the FER2013 dataset consists of 48 × 48-pixel face gray images, a total of 35,887 face images. The CFEE dataset contains 950,000 facial images with annotated action units (au). Using a random sampling strategy, we sent online questionnaires to 400 college students and received 374 responses, and the response rate was 93.5%. After pre-processing, 350 results were available, including 187 male and 153 female students. First, the facial emotion data of students were collected in an online questionnaire test. Then, a pre-trained model was used for emotion recognition. Finally, the online psychological questionnaire scores and the facial emotion recognition model scores were collated to give a comprehensive psychological evaluation score. Results: The experimental results of the facial emotion recognition model proposed to show that its classification results are broadly consistent with the mental health survey results. This model can be used to improve efficiency. In particular, the accuracy of the facial emotion recognition model proposed in this paper is higher than that of the general mental health model, which only uses the traditional single questionnaire. Furthermore, the absolute errors of this study in the three symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress are lower than other mental health survey results and are only 0.8%, 8.1%, 3.5%, and 1.8%, respectively. Conclusion: The mixed method combining intelligent methods and scales for mental health assessment has high recognition accuracy. Therefore, it can support efficient large-scale screening of students’ psychological problems.",10.3390/ijerph192214976,8,Scopus,85142940496,2-s2.0-85142940496,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142940496
Exposure to Nature Sounds through a Mobile Application in Daily Life: Effects on Learning Performance among University Students,Luo J.,2022,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Previous studies have revealed the restorative effects of exposure to natural environments on psychological well-being and cognitive performance. Recent studies have reported the effects of exposure to nature sounds (e.g., the sounds of birds, rainfall, and waves) through a mobile application on reducing students’ mental fatigue and improving their cognitive performance. However, it remains unknown whether exposure to nature sounds through a mobile application may influence students’ learning performance. To address the gap, we conducted a study with 71 university students. During the four-week intervention, 36 students in the experimental group were exposed to nature sounds through a free mobile application for at least 30 consecutive minutes per day when working on academic-related tasks; 35 students in the control group did not have such exposure when working on similar tasks. The results show that students in the experimental group outperformed those in the control group in their engagement in deep learning, frequency of academic procrastination, and academic self-efficacy. The findings reveal the promising effects of exposure to nature sounds through a mobile application on improving students’ learning performance. The implications of the findings are discussed.",10.3390/ijerph192114583,12,Scopus,85141564371,2-s2.0-85141564371,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141564371
Artificial intelligence-based analytics for impacts of COVID-19 and online learning on college students’ mental health,Rezapour M.,2022,Plos One,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), first emerged in Wuhan, China late in December 2019.

"Mental Health Chatbot for Young Adults With Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Single-Blind, Three-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial",He Y.,2022,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Depression has a high prevalence among young adults, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, mental health services remain scarce and underutilized worldwide. Mental health chatbots are a novel digital technology to provide fully automated interventions for depressive symptoms. Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the clinical effectiveness and nonclinical performance of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mental health chatbot (XiaoE) for young adults with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In a single-blind, 3-arm randomized controlled trial, participants manifesting depressive symptoms recruited from a Chinese university were randomly assigned to a mental health chatbot (XiaoE; n=49), an e-book (n=49), or a general chatbot (Xiaoai; n=50) group in a ratio of 1:1:1. Participants received a 1-week intervention. The primary outcome was the reduction of depressive symptoms according to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 1 week later (T1) and 1 month later (T2). Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted under analysis of covariance models adjusting for baseline data. Controlled multiple imputation and δ-based sensitivity analysis were performed for missing data. The secondary outcomes were the level of working alliance measured using the Working Alliance Questionnaire (WAQ), usability measured using the Usability Metric for User Experience-LITE (UMUX-LITE), and acceptability measured using the Acceptability Scale (AS). Results: Participants were on average 18.78 years old, and 37.2% (55/148) were female. The mean baseline PHQ-9 score was 10.02 (SD 3.18; range 2-19). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed lower PHQ-9 scores among participants in the XiaoE group compared with participants in the e-book group and Xiaoai group at both T1 (F<inf>2,136</inf>=17.011; P < .001; d=0.51) and T2 (F<inf>2,136</inf>=5.477; P=.005; d=0.31). Better working alliance (WAQ; F<inf>2,145</inf>=3.407; P=.04) and acceptability (AS; F<inf>2,145</inf>=4.322; P=.02) were discovered with XiaoE, while no significant difference among arms was found for usability (UMUX-LITE; F<inf>2,145</inf>=0.968; P=.38). Conclusions: A CBT-based chatbot is a feasible and engaging digital therapeutic approach that allows easy accessibility and self-guided mental health assistance for young adults with depressive symptoms. A systematic evaluation of nonclinical metrics for a mental health chatbot has been established in this study. In the future, focus on both clinical outcomes and nonclinical metrics is necessary to explore the mechanism by which mental health chatbots work on patients. Further evidence is required to confirm the long-term effectiveness of the mental health chatbot via trails replicated with a longer dose, as well as exploration of its stronger efficacy in comparison with other active controls.",10.2196/40719,89,Scopus,85142401562,2-s2.0-85142401562,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142401562
A Chatbot to Support Young People During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New Zealand: Evaluation of the Real-World Rollout of an Open Trial,Ludin N.,2022,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The number of young people in New Zealand (Aotearoa) who experience mental health challenges is increasing. As those in Aotearoa went into the initial COVID-19 lockdown, an ongoing digital mental health project was adapted and underwent rapid content authoring to create the Aroha chatbot. This dynamic digital support was designed with and for young people to help manage pandemic-related worry. Objective: Aroha was developed to provide practical evidence-based tools for anxiety management using cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. The chatbot included practical ideas to maintain social and cultural connection, and to stay active and well. Methods: Stay-at-home orders under Aotearoa’s lockdown commenced on March 20, 2020. By leveraging previously developed chatbot technology and broader existing online trial infrastructure, the Aroha chatbot was launched promptly on April 7, 2020. Dissemination of the chatbot for an open trial was via a URL, and feedback on the experience of the lockdown and the experience of Aroha was gathered via online questionnaires and a focus group, and from community members. Results: In the 2 weeks following the launch of the chatbot, there were 393 registrations, and 238 users logged into the chatbot, of whom 127 were in the target age range (13-24 years). Feedback guided iterative and responsive content authoring to suit the dynamic situation and motivated engineering to dynamically detect and react to a range of conversational intents. Conclusions: The experience of the implementation of the Aroha chatbot highlights the feasibility of providing timely event-specific digital mental health support and the technology requirements for a flexible and enabling chatbot architectural framework.",10.2196/38743,18,Scopus,85141890740,2-s2.0-85141890740,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141890740
Evaluating the use of chatbot during pregnancy: A usability study,Montenegro J.L.Z.,2022,Healthcare Analytics,"Reduced anxiety is critical for the baby's health during the thousand days of pregnancy. In this age of false information, unreliable data can be harmful to pregnant women during prenatal and postnatal periods. This work presents the findings of a pilot study that investigated the use of chatbots to assist pregnant women during the prenatal and postnatal periods in Brazil. We conducted experiments with healthcare professionals and pregnant women, using the parallel convergent mixed method design to compare the perceptions of the two groups. We applied a quantitative/qualitative study using data collection tools available via the internet. Before responding to the survey instrument, both groups spent seven days interacting with the chatbot. Two doctors validated the questionnaires, and we used a previously validated questionnaire for pregnant women. Seven physicians’ and thirteen pregnant women who met the search criteria participated in the study. Pregnant women believe that interacting with the chatbot educated them and, their physicians will approve of their use. The most significant and positive construct was related to the chatbot's performance expectation ([Mean 4.61][SD 0.74]). The construct that had the least positive influence on pregnant women was Facilitating Conditions ([Mean 3.30],[SD 1.24]). Pregnant women, according to physicians, benefit from clear language and comprehensive information in a variety of ways. Finally, it was established that the presented agent is viable and beneficial for pregnant women and healthcare providers. We intend to focus more on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to improve the chatbot conversation aspects in future studies.",10.1016/j.health.2022.100072,14,Scopus,85148438133,2-s2.0-85148438133,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148438133
"Doping with aromatase inhibitors and oestrogen receptor modulators in steroid users: Analysis of a forum to identify dosages, durations and adverse drug reactions",Rochoy M.,2022,Therapies,"Introduction: Some users of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) secretly consume aromatase inhibitors (AI) and selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERM). Cyber-forums can be potential sources of information. Our aim was to determine the cycles used, and to identify the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) experienced, reported in a bodybuilding forum. Method: We collected discussions on a French forum for AAS users (MESO-Rx®), from January 2013 to 2019 on concerning clomiphene, tamoxifen, anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole were collected. Characteristics of the users, duration of cures, treatments, dosages, point of purchase and occurrence of ADRs were analysed. Results: Among the 1792 posts published on the forum, 845 concerned SERM and 571 concerned AI, i.e. 2180 drugs used (several cycles included concomitant consumption). Our population was exclusively male, with an average age of 28.2 ± 6.3 years, and had been practising weight training for 6.7 ± 5.6 years. The SERMs were mainly used to “revive the hypothalamohypophyseal axis” and the AIs to “fight against androgen aromatisation”. The median treatment duration was 22 days for SERM, 70 days for anastrozole, 84 days for exemestane and 30 days for letrozole, with a mean dose of 69 mg/d for clomiphene, 22 mg/d for tamoxifen, 0.4 mg/d for anastrozole, 10 mg/d for exemestane, 2 mg/d for letrozole. The main way of obtaining these drugs was through the internet. 157 ADRs were identified: 95 for SERMs and 62 for AI. The most represented were acne, musculoskeletal, mood and reproductive disorders. Impaired quality of life (according to the patient) was described in 54% of the SERM posts and 26% of the AI posts. Conclusions: Patient narratives posted on forums can be a useful tool in the context of doping, to better understand practices, motivations and possibly to bring up pharmacovigilance signals.",10.1016/j.therap.2022.03.004,13,Scopus,85142363820,2-s2.0-85142363820,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142363820
Chatbot-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Adolescents With Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Feasibility and Acceptability Study,Nicol G.,2022,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm have escalated among adolescents to crisis levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic. Objective: In this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability. Methods: This small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety. Results: The pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis. The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or moderate symptoms. Conclusions: In this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted. Future study inclusive of rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and underrepresented communities is needed to establish generalizability of effectiveness and identify implementation-related adaptations needed to promote broader uptake in pediatric primary care.",10.2196/40242,68,Scopus,85144759725,2-s2.0-85144759725,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144759725
Digital phenotyping for classification of anxiety severity during COVID-19,Nguyen B.,2022,Frontiers in Digital Health,"COVID-19 has led to an increase in anxiety among Canadians. Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS) is a dataset created by Statistics Canada to monitor the effects of COVID-19 among Canadians. Survey data were collected to evaluate health and health-related behaviours. This work evaluates CPSS2 and CPSS4, which were collected in May and July of 2020, respectively. The survey data consist of up to 102 questions. This work proposes the use of the survey data characteristics to identify the level of anxiety within the Canadian population during the first- and second-phases of COVID-19 and is validated by using the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 questionnaire. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) is applied to select the top features to represent user anxiety, and support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the separation of anxiety severity. We employ SVM for binary classification with 10-fold cross validation to separate the labels of Minimal and Severe anxiety to achieve an overall accuracy of (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) for CPSS2 and CPSS4, respectively. After analysis, we compared the results of the first and second phases of COVID-19 and determined a subset of the features that could be represented as pseudo passive (PP) data. The accurate classification provides a proxy on the potential onsets of anxiety to provide tailored interventions. Future works can augment the proposed PP data for carrying out a more detailed digital phenotyping.",10.3389/fdgth.2022.877762,5,Scopus,85140801860,2-s2.0-85140801860,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140801860
Analysis and research on the influence of music on students’ mental health under the background of deep learning,Wang T.,2022,Frontiers in Psychology,"This paper makes a detailed analysis and discussion on the impact of music appreciation on college students’ mental health and the influence of music appreciation on students’ mental health, mental energy and mental structure. There has long been the idea of music promoting people’s mental health, as well as related research in the field of music psychology. For this specific group of primary and secondary school students, it should be said that it is relatively rare to consider using music education to promote their mental health. This paper summarizes the advantages of deep learning over shallow learning, explains the necessity of introducing deep learning, and describes the data representation of deep learning and several typical deep learning models. This study adopts the method of multi-evidence to conduct in-depth research and analysis. On the basis of in-depth study and research, this paper analyzes and studies the impact of music on students’ mental health, so as to lay a foundation for future research on students’ mental health. In terms of influencing factors and strategies to promote students’ in-depth learning, we should apply the research results to specific teaching situations with the help of advanced digital technology, and strive to combine theory with practice. The research shows that college students’ mental health is an important part of quality education in Colleges and universities, and music education plays an important role in the implementation of quality education.",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.998451,9,Scopus,85140597242,2-s2.0-85140597242,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140597242
Validity of Chatbot Use for Mental Health Assessment: Experimental Study,Schick A.,2022,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Mental disorders in adolescence and young adulthood are major public health concerns. Digital tools such as text-based conversational agents (ie, chatbots) are a promising technology for facilitating mental health assessment. However, the human-like interaction style of chatbots may induce potential biases, such as socially desirable responding (SDR), and may require further effort to complete assessments. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the convergent and discriminant validity of chatbots for mental health assessments, the effect of assessment mode on SDR, and the effort required by participants for assessments using chatbots compared with established modes. Methods: In a counterbalanced within-subject design, we assessed 2 different constructs-psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory-18) and problematic alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-3)-in 3 modes (chatbot, paper-and-pencil, and web-based), and examined convergent and discriminant validity. In addition, we investigated the effect of mode on SDR, controlling for perceived sensitivity of items and individuals' tendency to respond in a socially desirable way, and we also assessed the perceived social presence of modes. Including a between-subject condition, we further investigated whether SDR is increased in chatbot assessments when applied in a self-report setting versus when human interaction may be expected. Finally, the effort (ie, complexity, difficulty, burden, and time) required to complete the assessments was investigated. Results: A total of 146 young adults (mean age 24, SD 6.42 years; n=67, 45.9% female) were recruited from a research panel for laboratory experiments. The results revealed high positive correlations (all P<.001) of measures of the same construct across different modes, indicating the convergent validity of chatbot assessments. Furthermore, there were no correlations between the distinct constructs, indicating discriminant validity. Moreover, there were no differences in SDR between modes and whether human interaction was expected, although the perceived social presence of the chatbot mode was higher than that of the established modes (P<.001). Finally, greater effort (all P<.05) and more time were needed to complete chatbot assessments than for completing the established modes (P<.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that chatbots may yield valid results. Furthermore, an understanding of chatbot design trade-offs in terms of potential strengths (ie, increased social presence) and limitations (ie, increased effort) when assessing mental health were established.",10.2196/28082,41,Scopus,85140936366,2-s2.0-85140936366,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140936366
Objective Assessment of the Nature and Extent of Children's Internet-Based World: Protocol for the Kids Online Aotearoa Study,Gurtner M.,2022,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Children under 18 years of age account for approximately 1 in 3 internet users worldwide. Largely unregulated, the internet-based world is evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly intrusive. There is a dearth of objective research globally on children's real-time experiences of the internet-based world. Objective: This paper reports an objective methodology to study the nature and extent of children's internet-based world, their engagement with it, and how this impacts their health and well-being. Methods: A total of 180 year 8 students from 12 schools will be recruited into the study within the Wellington region of Aotearoa, New Zealand. Children use Zoom video teleconferencing software to record real-time, screen-shared internet-based content, for 4 consecutive days. Data on demographics, health and well-being, and attitudes and perceived behaviors in relation to the internet-based world are collected. Phone screen-time balances are retrieved. Data collection commenced in June 2021 and is anticipated to be completed in 2023. Results: Recordings show children exploring diverse web-based settings and content, including personalized content curated by algorithms on platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Preliminary analysis shows that the data can be used to study a wide range of topics. Behavioral Observation Research Interaction Software is being used to manually code recordings. Artificial Intelligence techniques are also being applied, including hashtag extraction, optical character recognition, as well as object, pattern, speech, and lyric recognition. Conclusions: This novel methodology reveals the unique internet-based experiences of children. It is underpinned by a commitment to ensuring that their rights are protected. It seeks to provide concrete evidence on internet usage in this group and to facilitate appropriate political and societal action to effectively regulate the internet-based world to prevent harm to children.",10.2196/39017,9,Scopus,85142395808,2-s2.0-85142395808,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142395808
Performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models Designed for Application in Pediatric Dentistry—A Systematic Review,Khanagar S.B.,2022,Applied Sciences Switzerland,"Oral diseases are the most prevalent chronic childhood diseases, presenting as a major public health issue affecting children of all ages in the developing and developed countries. Early detection and control of these diseases is very crucial for a child’s oral health and general wellbeing. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the performance of artificial intelligence models designed for application in pediatric dentistry. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using different electronic databases, primarily (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane) and secondarily (Google Scholar and the Saudi Digital Library) for studies published from 1 January 2000, until 20 July 2022, related to the research topic. The quality of the twenty articles that satisfied the eligibility criteria were critically analyzed based on the QUADAS-2 guidelines. Artificial intelligence models have been utilized for the detection of plaque on primary teeth, prediction of children’s oral health status (OHS) and treatment needs (TN); detection, classification and prediction of dental caries; detection and categorization of fissure sealants; determination of the chronological age; determination of the impact of oral health on adolescent’s quality of life; automated detection and charting of teeth; and automated detection and classification of mesiodens and supernumerary teeth in primary or mixed dentition. Artificial intelligence has been widely applied in pediatric dentistry in order to help less-experienced clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses. These models are very efficient in identifying and categorizing children into various risk groups at the individual and community levels. They also aid in developing preventive strategies, including designing oral hygiene practices and adopting healthy eating habits for individuals.",10.3390/app12199819,9,Scopus,85140011210,2-s2.0-85140011210,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140011210
Telemedicine Experience for PrEP Care among PrEP-Eligible Women and Their Primary Care Providers during the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States,Zhang C.,2022,Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease,"(1) Background: During the two-year-long siege from the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of doctor visits transitioned from in-person to virtual. Scare evidence is available to assess the quality of patient-provider communication via the platform of telemedicine, especially for PrEP care within primary care settings. (2) Methods: Participants included 18 primary care providers and 29 PrEP-eligible women. Through content analysis and thematic analysis, facilitators and barriers embedded at different levels of telemedicine were identified and assessed. (3) Results: Women and providers reported pros and cons regarding their telemedicine experiences during the initial wave of COVID-19. Both groups of participants agreed that telemedicine visits were more convenient, efficient, and comfortable than in-person visits. However, without face-to-face interactions, some women felt less empathy, caring, and connected with their providers during virtual visits. Health providers expressed concerns with telemedicine, including patients’ privacy, lack of intimacy between patients and providers, and delayed lab work. (4) Conclusions: Our data indicate multi-level factors may affect telemedicine experience among PrEP-eligible women and health providers. Participants expressed concerns that may further entrench these long-existing health disparities in healthcare. Proactive efforts from policymakers, health professionals, researchers, and stakeholders are urgently required to tackle identified barriers and to pave the way for the new infrastructure that ensures health equity in society.",10.3390/tropicalmed7100280,8,Scopus,85140457563,2-s2.0-85140457563,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140457563
"Understanding eating behaviours, mental health and weight change in young adults: protocol paper for an international longitudinal study",Whatnall M.,2022,BMJ Open,"Introduction Understanding the complexities of change in eating behaviours, mental health, well-being and weight is crucial to inform healthcare and service provision, particularly in light of the exacerbating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to address the need for more comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence, by tracking eating behaviours, mental health, health related behaviours and weight over a 12-month period, in a sample of young adults (18-35 years) in the UK and Australia. Methods and analysis Online surveys administered via the Prolific online research platform will be used for data collection at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. The survey (approximately 45 min) measures demographics, the impact of COVID-19, body mass index (BMI), weight management and health service usage, eating behaviours, personality, mental health, and health-related behaviours. An optional substudy component at each time point aims to validate self-reported weight in the main survey through images. Study inclusion criteria are; aged 18-34 years at baseline, BMI ≥20 kg/m 2, and residing in the UK or Australia. A target of 500 participants at baseline was set, recruited through Prolific, and with recruitment stratified by BMI, sex and country. The proposed analyses include creating static predictive models using baseline data (eg, using latent class analysis, factor analysis or similar), and mapping changes longitudinally (eg, using multivariate regressions). These analyses will enable changes in the study measures to be identified, as well as predictors and outcomes of change. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted by Leeds Beckett University, UK (reference number 86004) and the University of Newcastle, Australia (reference number H-2022-0110). Study findings will be disseminated through scientific journals, conferences, institute websites and social media, and briefings tailored to policy, practice and the public, with the intention to help inform the future development of health and well-being care and support for young adults across Australia and the UK.",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064963,2,Scopus,85139536013,2-s2.0-85139536013,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139536013
Scoliosis: Brace treatment - From the past 50 years to the future,Landauer F.,2022,Medicine United States,"Objective: This paper deals with scoliosis treatment over the past 50 years. The review of the literature from the point of view of the current formation of opinion. From conservative forms of treatment, the pendulum has swung to surgical measures. To visualize this temporarily rejection of conservative treatment is the goal of this article. Materials and Methods: A review of the literature over the last 50 years was performed from the perspective of current opinion, this with a pinch of personal experience in bracing and scoliosis surgery since 1972. The MESH terms (scoliosis, idiopathic scoliosis, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis) are presented in their number in a flow diagram and the publications on conservative therapies (brace, physiotherapy) are compared to surgical therapies (surgery). Opinions of ""eminences"" in the 1980s have been replaced by the rules of evidence-based medicine (EBM) at end of the 1990s. This transition will be visualized in the graph of PubMed statistics. In a statement, the future scoliosis treatment is derived from history. Results: The total number of publications shows a ratio of brace to surgery of 13.9% and physiotherapy to surgery of 6.7% for the MESH terms ""scoliosis"". When ""scoliosis"" is supplemented with ""idiopathic"", the brace to surgery ratio changes from 24.5% and physiotherapy to surgery 8.2%. Focusing on adolescent scoliosis the addition of ""adolescent"" changes the brace to surgery ratio from 24.8% and physiotherapy to surgery 8.1%. In the total number of publications, ""adolescent idiopathic scoliosis"" is treated by 25.26%. The patient numbers of our own scoliosis outpatient clinic (1482 patients) over the last 15 years show a ratio of brace (Cobb angle 20°-50° brace-indication) to surgery (Cobb angle >50° indication to surgery) of 1 to 0.06. The scientific focus on surgical therapy is evident from the figures of PubMed mentioned. The number of conservative publications shows a depression in the 1990s. In the remainder of this article, opinion-forming developments are outlined and supported by literature citations, responsible for the recovery of publications on conservative scoliosis treatment. New technologies provide additional treatment options. Conclusions: In this sense, brace therapy is a success story with a future in the digital world of AI (artificial intelligence), mathematical model calculations, and production perhaps from the 3D printer. The central message from the history of the last 50 years is: ""The scientific review of treatment results is essential for the further acceptance of brace treatment."".",10.1097/MD.0000000000030556,11,Scopus,85138165033,2-s2.0-85138165033,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138165033
Mental Health in Chilean Higher Education Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study,García F.E.,2022,Psychological Trauma Theory Research Practice and Policy,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has required important changes in the lifestyles and quality of life of higher education students, generating emotional distress. This study sought to evaluate a predictive model of emotional distress and positive mental health through measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) in Chilean higher education students during the pandemic. Method: To this end, 502 students (67.8% female), aged 18–44 years, were surveyed at two time points during the pandemic, separated by 6 months. Potential predictors included emotional regulation strategies, perceived social support, sociodemographic characteristics, factors related to the pandemic, and students’ experiences related to online classes. Results: Findings indicated that PTSS levels were generally stable across the two time points, but PTG levels increased. In addition, emotional regulation strategies (suppression, cognitive reappraisal), perceived social support, and female gender predicted both PTSS and PTG 6 months later; students’ number of hours of screen time for school also influenced PTG. Conclusions: Findings enhance understanding of the processes contributing to PTSS and PTG in higher education students. The need to improve quality of life and mental health in higher education students, including individual- and institutional-level strategies, is discussed.",10.1037/tra0001363,4,Scopus,85139354006,2-s2.0-85139354006,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139354006
"Implementation Fidelity of Chatbot Screening for Social Needs: Acceptability, Feasibility, Appropriateness",Langevin R.,2022,Applied Clinical Informatics,"Objectives Patient and provider-facing screening tools for social determinants of health have been explored in a variety of contexts; however, effective screening and resource referral remain challenging, and less is known about how patients perceive chatbots as potential social needs screening tools. We investigated patient perceptions of a chatbot for social needs screening using three implementation outcome measures: acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness. Methods We implemented a chatbot for social needs screening at one large public hospital emergency department (ED) and used concurrent triangulation to assess perceptions of the chatbot use for screening. A total of 350 ED visitors completed the social needs screening and rated the chatbot on implementation outcome measures, and 22 participants engaged in follow-up phone interviews. Results The screened participants ranged in age from 18 to 90 years old and were diverse in race/ethnicity, education, and insurance status. Participants (n = 350) rated the chatbot as an acceptable, feasible, and appropriate way of screening. Through interviews (n = 22), participants explained that the chatbot was a responsive, private, easy to use, efficient, and comfortable channel to report social needs in the ED, but wanted more information on data use and more support in accessing resources. Conclusion In this study, we deployed a chatbot for social needs screening in a real-world context and found patients perceived the chatbot to be an acceptable, feasible, and appropriate modality for social needs screening. Findings suggest that chatbots are a promising modality for social needs screening and can successfully engage a large, diverse patient population in the ED. This is significant, as it suggests that chatbots could facilitate a screening process that ultimately connects patients to care for social needs, improving health and well-being for members of vulnerable patient populations.",10.1055/a-2035-5342,7,Scopus,85159308553,2-s2.0-85159308553,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159308553
Exploring the Suicide Mechanism Path of High-Suicide-Risk Adolescents—Based on Weibo Text Analysis,Mo L.,2022,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Background: Adolescent suicide can have serious consequences for individuals, families and society, so we should pay attention to it. As social media becomes a platform for adolescents to share their daily lives and express their emotions, online identification and intervention of adolescent suicide problems become possible. In order to find the suicide mechanism path of high-suicide-risk adolescents, we explore the factors that influence is, especially the relations between psychological pain, hopelessness and suicide stages. Methods: We identified high-suicide-risk adolescents through machine learning model identification and manual identification, and used the Weibo text analysis method to explore the suicide mechanism path of high-suicide-risk adolescents. Results: Qualitative analysis showed that 36.2% of high-suicide-risk adolescents suffered from mental illness, and depression accounted for 76.3% of all mental illnesses. The mediating effect analysis showed that hopelessness played a complete mediating role between psychological pain and suicide stages. In addition, hopelessness was significantly negatively correlated with suicide stages. Conclusion: mental illness (especially depression) in high-suicide-risk adolescents is closely related to suicide stages, the later the suicide stage, the higher the diagnosis rate of mental illness. The suicide mechanism path in high-suicide-risk adolescents is: psychological pain→ hopelessness → suicide stages, indicating that psychological pain mainly affects suicide risk through hopelessness. Adolescents who are later in the suicide stages have fewer expressions of hopelessness in the traditional sense.",10.3390/ijerph191811495,4,Scopus,85138356603,2-s2.0-85138356603,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138356603
Technology Matters: Machine learning approaches to personalised child and adolescent mental health care,Paton L.W.,2022,Child and Adolescent Mental Health,"There has been much interest in the potential for machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance health care. In this article, we discuss the potential applications of the technology to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). We also outline the four key criteria that are likely to be necessary for automated prediction to be translated into clinical benefit. These relate to the choice of task to be automated, the nature of the available data, the methods applied and the context of the system to be implemented.",10.1111/camh.12546,6,Scopus,85125894625,2-s2.0-85125894625,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125894625
Investigating the Effects of Microclimate on Physiological Stress and Brain Function with Data Science and Wearables,Lim K.Y.T.,2022,Sustainability Switzerland,"This paper reports a study conducted by students as an independent research project under the mentorship of a research scientist at the National Institute of Education, Singapore. The aim of the study was to explore the relationships between local environmental stressors and physiological responses from the perspective of citizen science. Starting from July 2021, data from EEG headsets were complemented by those obtained from smartwatches (namely heart rate and its variability and body temperature and stress score). Identical units of a wearable device containing environmental sensors (such as ambient temperature, air pressure, infrared radiation, and relative humidity) were designed and worn, respectively, by five adolescents for the same period. More than 100,000 data points of different types—neurological, physiological, and environmental—were eventually collected and were processed through a random forest regression model and deep learning models. The results showed that the most influential microclimatic factors on the biometric indicators were noise and the concentrations of carbon dioxide and dust. Subsequently, more complex inferences were made from the Shapley value interpretation of the regression models. Such findings suggest implications for the design of living conditions with respect to the interaction of the microclimate and human health and comfort.",10.3390/su141710769,4,Scopus,85137919415,2-s2.0-85137919415,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137919415
Temperature impacts on hate speech online: evidence from 4 billion geolocated tweets from the USA,Stechemesser A.,2022,Lancet Planetary Health,"Background: A link between weather and aggression in the offline world has been established across a variety of societal settings. Simultaneously, the rapid digitalisation of nearly every aspect of everyday life has led to a high frequency of interpersonal conflicts online. Hate speech online has become a prevalent problem that has been shown to aggravate mental health conditions, especially among young people and marginalised groups. We examine the effect of temperature on the occurrence of hate speech on the social media platform Twitter and interpret the results in the context of the interlinkage between climate change, human behaviour, and mental health. Methods: In this quantitative empirical study, we used a supervised machine learning approach to identify hate speech in a dataset containing around 4 billion geolocated tweets from 773 cities across the USA between May 1, 2014 and May 1, 2020. We statistically evaluated the changes in daily hate tweets against changes in local temperature, isolating the temperature influence from confounding factors using binned panel-regression models. Findings: The prevalence of hate tweets was lowest at moderate temperatures (12 to 21°C) and marked increases in the number of hate tweets were observed at hotter and colder temperatures, reaching up to 12·5% (95% CI 8·0–16·5) for cold temperature extremes (–6 to –3°C) and up to 22·0% (95% CI 20·5–23·5) for hot temperature extremes (42 to 45°C). Outside of the moderate temperature range, the hate tweets also increased as a proportion of total tweeting activity. The quasi-quadratic shape of the temperature–hate tweet curve was robust across varying climate zones, income quartiles, religious and political beliefs, and both city-level and state-level aggregations. However, temperature ranges with the lowest prevalence of hate tweets were centred around the local temperature mean and the magnitude of the increases in hate tweets for hot and cold temperatures varied across the climate zones. Interpretation: Our results highlight hate speech online as a potential channel through which temperature alters interpersonal conflict and societal aggression. We provide empirical evidence that hot and cold temperatures can aggravate aggressive tendencies online. The prevalence of the results across climatic and socioeconomic subgroups points to limitations in the ability of humans to adapt to temperature extremes.

"Investigating the relationship between thought interference, somatic passivity and outcomes in patients with psychosis: a natural language processing approach using a clinical records search platform in south London",Magrangeas T.T.,2022,BMJ Open,"Objectives We aimed to apply natural language processing algorithms in routine healthcare records to identify reported somatic passivity (external control of sensations, actions and impulses) and thought interference symptoms (thought broadcasting, insertion, withdrawal), first-rank symptoms traditionally central to diagnosing schizophrenia, and determine associations with prognosis by analysing routine outcomes. Design Four algorithms were developed on deidentified mental healthcare data and applied to ascertain recorded symptoms over the 3 months following first presentation to a mental healthcare provider in a cohort of patients with a primary schizophreniform disorder (ICD-10 F20-F29) diagnosis. Setting and participants From the electronic health records of a large secondary mental healthcare provider in south London, 9323 patients were ascertained from 2007 to the data extraction date (25 February 2020). Outcomes The primary binary dependent variable for logistic regression analyses was any negative outcome (Mental Health Act section, >2 antipsychotics prescribed, >22 days spent in crisis care) over the subsequent 2 years. Results Final adjusted models indicated significant associations of this composite outcome with baseline somatic passivity (prevalence 4.9%; adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.88), thought insertion (10.7%; 1.24, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55) and thought withdrawal (4.9%; 1.36, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.69), but not independently with thought broadcast (10.3%; 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22). Conclusions Symptoms traditionally central to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but under-represented in current diagnostic frameworks, were thus identified as important predictors of short-term to medium-term prognosis in schizophreniform disorders.",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057433,2,Scopus,85135423666,2-s2.0-85135423666,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135423666
Correlates of past year suicidal thoughts among sexual and gender minority young adults: A machine learning analysis,Kundu A.,2022,Journal of Psychiatric Research,"Sexual and gender minority populations are at elevated risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts and attempting suicide. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health and substance use challenges among this population. We aimed to examine the relative importance and effects of intersectional factors and strong interactions associated with the risk of suicidal thoughts among Canadian lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and Two Spirit (LGBTQI2S+) young adults. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among LGBTQI2S + participants aged 16–29 years living in two Canadian provinces (Ontario, Quebec). Among 1414 participants (mean age 21.90 years), 61% (n = 857) participants reported suicidal thoughts in last 12 months. We built a random forest model to predict the risk of having past year suicidal thoughts, which achieved high performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84. The top 10 correlates identified were: seeking help from health professionals for mental health or substance use issues since the start of the pandemic, current self-rated mental health status, insulted by parents or adults in childhood, ever heard that being identifying as LGBTQI2S+ is not normal, age in years, past week feeling depressed, lifetime diagnosis of mental illness, lifetime diagnosis of depressive disorder, past week feeling sad, ever pretended to be straight or cisgender to be accepted. The increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts for those having mental health challenges or facing minority stressors is more pronounced in those living in urban areas or being unemployed than those living in rural areas or being employed.",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.06.013,16,Scopus,85132860315,2-s2.0-85132860315,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132860315
Deciphering the Diversity of Mental Models in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Knowledge Graph Representation of Public Data Using Natural Language Processing,Kaur M.,2022,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Understanding how individuals think about a topic, known as the mental model, can significantly improve communication, especially in the medical domain where emotions and implications are high. Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) represent a group of diagnoses, affecting up to 18% of the global population, involving differences in the development of cognitive or social functions. In this study, we focus on 2 NDDs, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which involve multiple symptoms and interventions requiring interactions between 2 important stakeholders: parents and health professionals. There is a gap in our understanding of differences between mental models for each stakeholder, making communication between stakeholders more difficult than it could be. Objective: We aim to build knowledge graphs (KGs) from web-based information relevant to each stakeholder as proxies of mental models. These KGs will accelerate the identification of shared and divergent concerns between stakeholders. The developed KGs can help improve knowledge mobilization, communication, and care for individuals with ADHD and ASD. Methods: We created 2 data sets by collecting the posts from web-based forums and PubMed abstracts related to ADHD and ASD. We utilized the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to detect biomedical concepts and applied Positive Pointwise Mutual Information followed by truncated Singular Value Decomposition to obtain corpus-based concept embeddings for each data set. Each data set is represented as a KG using a property graph model. Semantic relatedness between concepts is calculated to rank the relation strength of concepts and stored in the KG as relation weights. UMLS disorder-relevant semantic types are used to provide additional categorical information about each concept's domain. Results: The developed KGs contain concepts from both data sets, with node sizes representing the co-occurrence frequency of concepts and edge sizes representing relevance between concepts. ADHD- and ASD-related concepts from different semantic types shows diverse areas of concerns and complex needs of the conditions. KG identifies converging and diverging concepts between health professionals literature (PubMed) and parental concerns (web-based forums), which may correspond to the differences between mental models for each stakeholder. Conclusions: We show for the first time that generating KGs from web-based data can capture the complex needs of families dealing with ADHD or ASD. Moreover, we showed points of convergence between families and health professionals' KGs. Natural language processing-based KG provides access to a large sample size, which is often a limiting factor for traditional in-person mental model mapping. Our work offers a high throughput access to mental model maps, which could be used for further in-person validation, knowledge mobilization projects, and basis for communication about potential blind spots from stakeholders in interactions about NDDs. Future research will be needed to identify how concepts could interact together differently for each stakeholder.",10.2196/39888,8,Scopus,85135516984,2-s2.0-85135516984,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135516984
Real-Time Learning from an Expert in Deep Recommendation Systems with Application to mHealth for Physical Exercises,Mahyari A.,2022,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,"Recommendation systems play an important role in today's digital world. They have found applications in various areas such as music platforms, e.g., Spotify, and movie streaming services, e.g., Netflix. Less research effort has been devoted to physical exercise recommendation systems. Sedentary lifestyles have become the major driver of several diseases as well as healthcare costs. In this paper, we develop a recommendation system to recommend daily exercise activities to users based on their history, profiles and similar users. The developed recommendation system uses a deep recurrent neural network with user-profile attention and temporal attention mechanisms. Moreover, exercise recommendation systems are significantly different from streaming recommendation systems in that we are not able to collect click feedback from the participants in exercise recommendation systems. Thus, we propose a real-time, expert-in-the-loop active learning procedure. The active learner calculates the uncertainty of the recommendation system at each time step for each user and asks an expert for recommendation when the certainty is low. In this paper, we derive the probability distribution function of marginal distance, and use it to determine when to ask experts for feedback. Our experimental results on a mHealth and MovieLens datasets show improved accuracy after incorporating the real-time active learner with the recommendation system.",10.1109/JBHI.2022.3167314,19,Scopus,85128632970,2-s2.0-85128632970,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128632970
Developing and internally validating a prognostic model (P Risk) to improve the prediction of psychosis in a primary care population using electronic health records: The MAPPED study,Sullivan S.A.,2022,Schizophrenia Research,"Background: An accurate risk prediction algorithm could improve psychosis outcomes by reducing duration of untreated psychosis. Objective: To develop and validate a risk prediction model for psychosis, for use by family doctors, using linked electronic health records. Methods: A prospective prediction study. Records from family practices were used between 1/1/2010 to 31/12/2017 of 300,000 patients who had consulted their family doctor for any nonpsychotic mental health problem. Records were selected from Clinical Practice Research Datalink Gold, a routine database of UK family doctor records linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, a routine database of UK secondary care records. Each patient had 5–8 years of follow up data. Study predictors were consultations, diagnoses and/or prescribed medications, during the study period or historically, for 13 nonpsychotic mental health problems and behaviours, age, gender, number of mental health consultations, social deprivation, geographical location, and ethnicity. The outcome was time to an ICD10 psychosis diagnosis. Findings: 830 diagnoses of psychosis were made. Patients were from 216 family practices; mean age was 45.3 years and 43.5 % were male. Median follow-up was 6.5 years (IQR 5.6, 7.8). Overall 8-year psychosis incidence was 45.8 (95 % CI 42.8, 49.0)/100,000 person years at risk. A risk prediction model including age, sex, ethnicity, social deprivation, consultations for suicidal behaviour, depression/anxiety, substance abuse, history of consultations for suicidal behaviour, smoking history and prescribed medications for depression/anxiety/PTSD/OCD and total number of consultations had good discrimination (Harrell's C = 0.774).

Feasibility of Conducting Long-term Health and Behaviors Follow-up in Adolescents: Longitudinal Observational Study,Cucchiaro G.,2022,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Machine learning uses algorithms that improve automatically through experience. This statistical learning approach is a natural extension of traditional statistical methods and can offer potential advantages for certain problems. The feasibility of using machine learning techniques in health care is predicated on access to a sufficient volume of data in a problem space. Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of data collection from an adolescent population before and after a posterior spine fusion operation. Methods: Both physical and psychosocial data were collected. Adolescents scheduled for a posterior spine fusion operation were approached when they were scheduled for the surgery. The study collected repeated measures of patient data, including at least 2 weeks prior to the operation and 6 months after the patients were discharged from the hospital. Patients were provided with a Fitbit Charge 4 (consumer-grade health tracker) and instructed to wear it as often as possible. A third-party web-based portal was used to collect and store the Fitbit data, and patients were trained on how to download and sync their personal device data on step counts, sleep time, and heart rate onto the web-based portal. Demographic and physiologic data recorded in the electronic medical record were retrieved from the hospital data warehouse. We evaluated changes in the patients' psychological profile over time using several validated questionnaires (ie, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). Questionnaires were administered to patients using Qualtrics software. Patients received the questionnaire prior to and during the hospitalization and again at 3 and 6 months postsurgery. We administered paper-based questionnaires for the self-report of daily pain scores and the use of analgesic medications. Results: There were several challenges to data collection from the study population. Only 38% (32/84) of the patients we approached met eligibility criteria, and 50% (16/32) of the enrolled patients dropped out during the follow-up period-on average 17.6 weeks into the study. Of those who completed the study, 69% (9/13) reliably wore the Fitbit and downloaded data into the web-based portal. These patients also had a high response rate to the psychosocial surveys. However, none of the patients who finished the study completed the paper-based pain diary. There were no difficulties accessing the demographic and clinical data stored in the hospital data warehouse. Conclusions: This study identifies several challenges to long-term medical follow-up in adolescents, including willingness to participate in these types of studies and compliance with the various data collection approaches. Several of these challenges-insufficient incentives and personal contact between researchers and patients-should be addressed in future studies.",10.2196/37054,2,Scopus,85136955118,2-s2.0-85136955118,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136955118
Psychological factors of college students’ learning pressure under the online education mode during the epidemic,Fu L.,2022,Frontiers in Psychology,"The emergence of the network environment is the product of the combination of the development of computer technology and the development of network technology. Internet technology is slowly penetrating into all aspects of people’s lives and has had a huge impact and change on people’s lives. With the repeated outbreak of the epidemic in recent years, online education has been increasingly applied to the study and life of college students. The epidemic has lasted for 3 years, while the life of college students is only 4 years. In recent years, most of the campus study and life of college students have been carried out in the online education mode. This not only changed the mode of class, but also changed the mental health of college students. Taking the online education model during the epidemic as the research background, this paper selects the psychological factors of college students’ learning pressure to analyze, combined with the design and implementation of the questionnaire, to understand the impact of online education on college students’ cognition, emotion, willpower, and social interaction. The purpose is to find out the psychological factors of college students’ learning pressure under the online education mode, and to propose effective solutions. The analysis of the psychological factors of college students’ learning pressure in the form of questionnaires is more accurate than other forms of experimental investigation, the efficiency is increased by 32%, and the accuracy is also increased by 18%.",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.967578,1,Scopus,85135866568,2-s2.0-85135866568,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135866568
A synergistic mindsets intervention protects adolescents from stress,Yeager D.S.,2022,Nature,"Social-evaluative stressors—experiences in which people feel they could be judged negatively—pose a major threat to adolescent mental health<sup>1–3</sup> and can cause young people to disengage from stressful pursuits, resulting in missed opportunities to acquire valuable skills. Here we show that replicable benefits for the stress responses of adolescents can be achieved with a short (around 30-min), scalable 'synergistic mindsets' intervention. This intervention, which is a self-administered online training module, synergistically targets both growth mindsets<sup>4</sup> (the idea that intelligence can be developed) and stress-can-be-enhancing mindsets<sup>5</sup> (the idea that one’s physiological stress response can fuel optimal performance). In six double-blind, randomized, controlled experiments that were conducted with secondary and post-secondary students in the United States, the synergistic mindsets intervention improved stress-related cognitions (study 1, n = 2,717; study 2, n = 755), cardiovascular reactivity (study 3, n = 160; study 4, n = 200), daily cortisol levels (study 5, n = 118 students, n = 1,213 observations), psychological well-being (studies 4 and 5), academic success (study 5) and anxiety symptoms during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns (study 6, n = 341). Heterogeneity analyses (studies 3, 5 and 6) and a four-cell experiment (study 4) showed that the benefits of the intervention depended on addressing both mindsets—growth and stress—synergistically. Confidence in these conclusions comes from a conservative, Bayesian machine-learning statistical method for detecting heterogeneous effects<sup>6</sup>. Thus, our research has identified a treatment for adolescent stress that could, in principle, be scaled nationally at low cost.",10.1038/s41586-022-04907-7,131,Scopus,85133613039,2-s2.0-85133613039,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133613039
Research on Online Education Model and Crisis Intervention System in Universities Perspective on Mental Health,Tai R.,2022,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Due to COVID-19, online education has become the main and new teaching method in the lockdown zone. However, teachers and students inevitably feel difficult and distressful about these new ways. There are also some other issues, such as inadequate interactions in the online classroom, causing poor knowledge absorption. Compared with traditional offline education, students cannot release their emotions or psychological pressure. What's more, teachers aren't able to comprehensively evaluate students' psychological conditions, which lead to belated awareness and solutions of their psychological problems. Therefore, from the perspective of mental health, this paper is designed to analyze the needs of college students for online education based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, and to explore the corresponding mode and interventional strategies of psychological crisis under the impact of COVID-19 epidemic. Equipped with emotion recognition and attention recognition based on computer vision technology, an intelligent interactive online classroom is constructed. At the same time, by using social big data, natural language processing (NLP) emotion analysis is achieved, which has made multi-index mental health prediction and crisis intervention realized. Although under the influence of COVID-19, this will still help educators implement more comprehensive and convenient online education and provides a guarantee for the overall development for students.",10.1145/3551708.3551757,0,Scopus,85142859549,2-s2.0-85142859549,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142859549
Digital phenotyping correlations in larger mental health samples: analysis and replication,Currey D.,2022,Bjpsych Open,"Background Smartphones can facilitate patients completing surveys and collecting sensor data to gain insight into their mental health conditions. However, the utility of sensor data is still being explored. Prior studies have reported a wide range of correlations between passive data and survey scores. Aims To explore correlations in a large data-set collected with the mindLAMP app. Additionally, we explored whether passive data features could be used in models to predict survey results. Method Participants were asked to complete daily and weekly mental health surveys. After screening for data quality, our sample included 147 college student participants and 270 weeks of data. We examined correlations between six weekly surveys and 13 metrics derived from passive data features. Finally, we trained logistic regression models to predict survey scores from passive data with and without daily surveys. Results Similar to other large studies, our correlations were lower than prior reports from smaller studies. We found that the most useful features came from GPS, call, and sleep duration data. Logistic regression models performed poorly with only passive data, but when daily survey scores were included, performance greatly increased. Conclusions Although passive data alone may not provide enough information to predict survey scores, augmenting this data with short daily surveys can improve performance. Therefore, it may be that passive data can be used to refine survey score predictions and clinical utility may be derived from the combination of active and passive data.",10.1192/bjo.2022.507,29,Scopus,85132009757,2-s2.0-85132009757,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132009757
Predictive models for first-onset and persistence of depression and anxiety among university students,Ballester L.,2022,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Depression and anxiety are both prevalent among university students. They frequently co-occur and share risk factors. Yet few studies have focused on identifying students at highest risk of first-onset and persistence of either of these conditions. Methods: Multicenter cohort study among Spanish first-year university students. At baseline, students were assessed for lifetime and 12-month Major Depressive Episode and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (MDE-GAD), other mental disorders, childhood-adolescent adversities, stressful life events, social support, socio-demographics, and psychological factors using web-based surveys; 12-month MDE-GAD was again assessed at 12-month follow-up. Results: A total of 1253 students participated in both surveys (59.2% of baseline respondents; mean age = 18.7 (SD = 1.3); 56.0% female). First-onset of MDE-GAD at follow-up was 13.3%. Also 46.7% of those with baseline MDE-GAD showed persistence at follow-up. Childhood/Adolescence emotional abuse or neglect (OR= 4.33), prior bipolar spectrum disorder (OR= 4.34), prior suicidal ideation (OR=4.85) and prior lifetime symptoms of MDE (ORs=2.33-3.63) and GAD (ORs=2.15-3.75) were strongest predictors of first-onset MDE-GAD. Prior suicidal ideation (OR=3.17) and prior lifetime GAD symptoms (ORs=2.38-4.02) were strongest predictors of MDE-GAD persistence. Multivariable predictions from baseline showed AUCs of 0.76 for first-onset and 0.81 for persistence. 74.9% of first-onset MDE-GAD cases occurred among 30% students with highest predicted risk at baseline. Limitations: Self-report data were used; external validation of the multivariable prediction models is needed. Conclusion: MDE-GAD among university students is frequent, suggesting the need to implement web-based screening at university entrance that identify those students with highest risk.",10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.135,12,Scopus,85129247276,2-s2.0-85129247276,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129247276
First-Gen Lens: Assessing mental health of first-generation students across their first year at college using mobile sensing,Wang W.,2022,Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies,"The transition from high school to college is a taxing time for young adults. New students arriving on campus navigate a myriad of challenges centered around adapting to new living situations, financial needs, academic pressures and social demands. First-year students need to gain new skills and strategies to cope with these new demands in order to make good decisions, ease their transition to independent living and ultimately succeed. In general, first-generation students are less prepared when they enter college in comparison to non-first-generation students. This presents additional challenges for first-generation students to overcome and be successful during their college years. We study first-year students through the lens of mobile phone sensing across their first year at college, including all academic terms and breaks. We collect longitudinal mobile sensing data for N=180 first-year college students, where 27 of the students are first-generation, representing 15% of the study cohort and representative of the number of first-generation students admitted each year at the study institution, Dartmouth College. We discuss risk factors, behavioral patterns and mental health of first-generation and non-first-generation students. We propose a deep learning model that accurately predicts the mental health of first-generation students by taking into account important distinguishing behavioral factors of first-generation students. Our study, which uses the StudentLife app, offers data-informed insights that could be used to identify struggling students and provide new forms of phone-based interventions with the goal of keeping students on track.",10.1145/3543194,31,Scopus,85134250240,2-s2.0-85134250240,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134250240
StudentSADD: Rapid mobile depression and suicidal ideation screening of college students during the coronavirus pandemic,Tlachac M.L.,2022,Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies,"The growing prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation among college students further exacerbated by the Coronavirus pandemic is alarming, highlighting the need for universal mental illness screening technology. With traditional screening questionnaires too burdensome to achieve universal screening in this population, data collected through mobile applications has the potential to rapidly identify at-risk students. While prior research has mostly focused on collecting passive smartphone modalities from students, smartphone sensors are also capable of capturing active modalities. The general public has demonstrated more willingness to share active than passive modalities through an app, yet no such dataset of active mobile modalities for mental illness screening exists for students. Knowing which active modalities hold strong screening capabilities for student populations is critical for developing targeted mental illness screening technology. Thus, we deployed a mobile application to over 300 students during the COVID-19 pandemic to collect the Student Suicidal Ideation and Depression Detection (StudentSADD) dataset. We report on a rich variety of machine learning models including cutting-edge multimodal pretrained deep learning classifiers on active text and voice replies to screen for depression and suicidal ideation. This unique StudentSADD dataset is a valuable resource for the community for developing mobile mental illness screening tools.",10.1145/3534604,24,Scopus,85134262342,2-s2.0-85134262342,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134262342
Machine learning approach for anxiety and sleep disorders analysis during COVID-19 lockdown,Anbarasi L.J.,2022,Health and Technology,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus caused COVID-19 pandemic has led to various kinds of anxiety and stress in different strata and sections of the society. The aim of this study is to analyse the sleeping and anxiety disorder for a wide distribution of people of different ages and from different strata of life. The study also seeks to investigate the different symptoms and grievances that people suffer from in connection with their sleep patterns and predict the possible relationships and factors in association with outcomes related to COVID-19 pandemic induced stress and issues. A total of 740 participants (51.3% male and 48.7% female) structured with 2 sections, first with general demographic information and second with more targeted questions for each demographic were surveyed. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and General Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7) standard scales were utilized to measure the stress, sleep disorders and anxiety. Experimental results showed positive correlation between PSQI and GAD-7 scores for the participants. After adjusting for age and gender, occupation does not have an effect on sleep quality (PSQI), but it does have an effect on anxiety (GAD-7). Student community in spite of less susceptible to COVID-19 infection found to be highly prone to psychopathy mental health disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Young Adults,Marti-Puig P.,2022,Sensors,"Artificial intelligence techniques were explored to assess the ability to anticipate selfharming behaviour in the mental health context using a database collected by an app previously designed to record the emotional states and activities of a group of subjects exhibiting self-harm. Specifically, the Leave-One-Subject-Out technique was used to train classification trees with a maximum of five splits. The results show an accuracy of 84.78%, a sensitivity of 64.64% and a specificity of 85.53%. In addition, positive and negative predictive values were also obtained, with results of 14.48% and 98.47%, respectively. These results are in line with those reported in previous work using a multilevel mixed-effect regression analysis. The combination of apps and AI techniques is a powerful way to improve the tools to accompany and support the care and treatment of patients with this type of behaviour. These studies also guide the improvement of apps on the user side, simplifying and collecting more meaningful data, and on the therapist side, progressing in pathology treatments. Traditional therapy involves observing and reconstructing what had happened before episodes once they have occurred.

Development of “CULTURE FORWARD: A Strengths and Culture-Based Tool to Protect Our Native Youth From Suicide”,O’Keefe V.M.,2022,Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology,"Indigenous knowledge and practices promote American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN; Native) communities’ health and well-being. Historical losses and continued oppression have resulted in disproportionately higher AI/AN youth suicide rates. This article describes the development of a new national resource guide titled “CULTURE FORWARD” for tribal leaders and stakeholders to support youth suicide prevention efforts through cultural strengths. Method: The CULTURE FORWARD guide was developed over 6 months through a community-engaged process. We conducted nine roundtables and eight interviews with a wide variety of community members, leaders, and providers representing 36 diverse tribal communities and geographic regions. Participants discussed AI/AN youth risk and protective factors, successful community efforts to prevent suicide, and content and dissemination ideas. A comprehensive literature review complemented qualitative findings. A diverse and representative National Advisory Editorial Board guided content and design throughout development. Results: Qualitative data were analyzed iteratively and thematically. Across all listening sessions, culture was identified as a key protective factor against AI/AN youth suicide. Five themes related to cultural strengths informed guide chapters. Each chapter includes an introduction; how that theme helps prevent Native youth suicide; a review of academic literature, community stories and programs; action steps; and additional resources. Conclusions: CULTURE FORWARD honors and empowers communities by weaving strands of knowledge, stories, and practical resources highlighting Native communities’ strengths to protect against Native youth suicide. The guide is free online and print copies are being distributed nationally.",10.1037/cdp0000546,13,Scopus,85134052936,2-s2.0-85134052936,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134052936
Examining Social Media Experiences and Attitudes Toward Technology-Based Interventions for Reducing Social Isolation Among LGBTQ Youth Living in Rural United States: An Online Qualitative Study,Escobar-Viera C.G.,2022,Frontiers in Digital Health,"Purpose: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth living in rural areas who feel isolated are at high risk of depression and suicidality. Given the lack of support in their offline communities, many rural-living LGBTQ youth turn to social media for social support. In this qualitative study, we examined rural LGBTQ youth's social media experiences and attitudes toward technology-based interventions for reducing perceived isolation. Method: In Spring 2020, we conducted online interviews with LGBTQ youth aged 14-19, living in rural areas of the United States, who screened positive for perceived social isolation (n = 20; 11 cisgender sexual minority, 9 transgender). Interviews examined (1) supportive social media experiences, (2) personal strategies to improve social media experiences, and (3) perspective on potential digital intervention delivery modalities. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Related to supportive content and interactions, themes included (1) positive representation of and connecting with LGBTQ groups on social media are important; (2) content from people with shared experience feels supportive, and (3) lack of feedback to one's experiences is isolating. Regarding personal strategies to improve social media experiences, themes were (1) selecting platforms to connect with different audiences helps make for a more enjoyable social media experience, and (2) several social media platform features can help make for a safer social media experience. Youth discussed advantages and disadvantages of intervention delivery via a mobile app, social media pages or groups, conversational agents (chatbots), and a dedicated website. Conclusion: Viewing positive representation of and connecting with LGBTQ groups, content from people shared experiences, and utilizing a wide array of platform features to increase the likelihood of positive connections are key to a positive social media experience among this group. Combining delivery modalities is key to engaging rural-living LGBTQ youth in digitally delivered support interventions to reduce perceived isolation.

Flexibility and Social Disconnectedness: Assessing University Students' Well-Being Using an Experience Sampling Chatbot and Surveys Over Two Years of COVID-19,Draxler F.,2022,DIS 2022 Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference Digital Wellbeing,"COVID-19 caused an abrupt switch from face-to-face to online teaching. This led to unknown challenges and consequences for students and lecturers. In the first semester after its outbreak, we developed a messenger-based chatbot to perform an experience sampling study to evaluate students' well-being and experiences (n = 31) with the radical changes in higher education. Finding a decrease in students' perceived motivation but an increase in productivity, we conducted a follow-up survey to compare the development a year later (n = 41). Our results revealed two main student profiles, one feeling severely impacted by the persisting social distance in their study performance and the other appreciating the flexibility and expended free time due to the changes in the teaching formats. Based on our findings, we introduce implications for the overall design of higher education and show the benefits and challenges of combining chatbot-enabled experience sampling with traditional surveys.",10.1145/3532106.3533537,4,Scopus,85133557900,2-s2.0-85133557900,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133557900
Success Factors of an Early EHR System for Child and Adolescent Mental Health: Lessons Learned for Future Practice Data-Driven Decision Aids,Koochakpour K.,2022,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,"This paper recounts the successful BUPdata, a discontinued electronic health record (EHR) system for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Norway. It was developed and owned by the national association for CAMHS and fulfilled needs for collaborative care, practice insight, and service management. It aimed to unify the requirements of government, administration, clinicians, patients, and researchers alike, with the goal of providing uniform quality of care nationally. When CAMHS became integrated with specialist healthcare, BUPdata was replaced with more a general EHR system offering far less functionality and insight into CAMHS practice.

Machine learning model to predict mental health crises from electronic health records,Garriga R.,2022,Nature Medicine,"The timely identification of patients who are at risk of a mental health crisis can lead to improved outcomes and to the mitigation of burdens and costs. However, the high prevalence of mental health problems means that the manual review of complex patient records to make proactive care decisions is not feasible in practice. Therefore, we developed a machine learning model that uses electronic health records to continuously monitor patients for risk of a mental health crisis over a period of 28 days. The model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.797 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.159, predicting crises with a sensitivity of 58% at a specificity of 85%. A follow-up 6-month prospective study evaluated our algorithm’s use in clinical practice and observed predictions to be clinically valuable in terms of either managing caseloads or mitigating the risk of crisis in 64% of cases. To our knowledge, this study is the first to continuously predict the risk of a wide range of mental health crises and to explore the added value of such predictions in clinical practice.",10.1038/s41591-022-01811-5,118,Scopus,85130152064,2-s2.0-85130152064,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130152064
Prevalence of Sensitive Terms in Clinical Notes Using Natural Language Processing Techniques: Observational Study,Lee J.,2022,Jmir Medical Informatics,"Background: With the increased sharing of electronic health information as required by the US 21st Century Cures Act, there is an increased risk of breaching patient, parent, or guardian confidentiality. The prevalence of sensitive terms in clinical notes is not known. Objective: The aim of this study is to define sensitive terms that represent the documentation of content that may be private and determine the prevalence and characteristics of provider notes that contain sensitive terms. Methods: Using keyword expansion, we defined a list of 781 sensitive terms. We searched all provider history and physical, progress, consult, and discharge summary notes for patients aged 0-21 years written between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, for a direct string match of sensitive terms. We calculated the prevalence of notes with sensitive terms and characterized clinical encounters and patient characteristics. Results: Sensitive terms were present in notes from every clinical context in all pediatric ages. Terms related to the mental health category were most used overall (254,975/1,338,297, 19.5%), but terms related to substance abuse and reproductive health were most common in patients aged 0-3 years. History and physical notes (19,854/34,771, 57.1%) and ambulatory progress notes (265,302/563,273, 47.1%) were most likely to include sensitive terms. The highest prevalence of notes with sensitive terms was found in pain management (950/1112, 85.4%) and child abuse (1092/1282, 85.2%) clinics. Conclusions: Notes containing sensitive terms are not limited to adolescent patients, specific note types, or certain specialties.

Predicting Depression in Adolescents Using Mobile and Wearable Sensors: Multimodal Machine Learning–Based Exploratory Study,Mullick T.,2022,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Depression levels in adolescents have trended upward over the past several years. According to a 2020 survey by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 4.1 million US adolescents have experienced at least one major depressive episode. This number constitutes approximately 16% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. However, only 32.3% of adolescents received some form of specialized or nonspecialized treatment. Identifying worsening symptoms earlier using mobile and wearable sensors may lead to earlier intervention. Most studies on predicting depression using sensor-based data are geared toward the adult population. Very few studies look into predicting depression in adolescents. Objective: The aim of our work was to study passively sensed data from adolescents with depression and investigate the predictive capabilities of 2 machine learning approaches to predict depression scores and change in depression levels in adolescents. This work also provided an in-depth analysis of sensor features that serve as key indicators of change in depressive symptoms and the effect of variation of data samples on model accuracy levels. Methods: This study included 55 adolescents with symptoms of depression aged 12 to 17 years. Each participant was passively monitored through smartphone sensors and Fitbit wearable devices for 24 weeks. Passive sensors collected call, conversation, location, and heart rate information daily. Following data preprocessing, 67% (37/55) of the participants in the aggregated data set were analyzed. Weekly Patient Health Questionnaire-9 surveys answered by participants served as the ground truth. We applied regression-based approaches to predict the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression score and change in depression severity. These approaches were consolidated using universal and personalized modeling strategies. The universal strategies consisted of Leave One Participant Out and Leave Week X Out. The personalized strategy models were based on Accumulated Weeks and Leave One Week One User Instance Out. Linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms were trained to model the data. Results: We observed that personalized approaches performed better on adolescent depression prediction compared with universal approaches. The best models were able to predict depression score and weekly change in depression level with root mean squared errors of 2.83 and 3.21, respectively, following the Accumulated Weeks personalized modeling strategy. Our feature importance investigation showed that the contribution of screen-, call-, and location-based features influenced optimal models and were predictive of adolescent depression. Conclusions: This study provides insight into the feasibility of using passively sensed data for predicting adolescent depression. We demonstrated prediction capabilities in terms of depression score and change in depression level. The prediction results revealed that personalized models performed better on adolescents than universal approaches. Feature importance provided a better understanding of depression and sensor data. Our findings can help in the development of advanced adolescent depression predictions.",10.2196/35807,48,Scopus,85133074949,2-s2.0-85133074949,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133074949
Pharmacogenetics in psychiatry: some key clinical considerations,Fabbri C.,2022,Minerva Psychiatry,"Psychiatric disorders affect about 1 billion people and cause 19% of disabilities. Despite the high number of psychotropic drugs available, there are still few objective criteria to personalize treatments based on the individual characteristics, and pharmacogenetics (PGx) is one of them. this review aimed to present the current clinical applications of PGx in psychiatry and to discuss some key points related to the use of PGx in psychiatric practice. PGx is a potentially very useful resource; however, it should be applied on the ground of a series of considerations, starting with physicians’ training and patients’ point of view, that are important and interconnected elements. Patients may have different opinions, perceptions and needs concerning their therapeutic plan, including the use of PGx; clinicians should be trained both on technical aspects and proper skills to communicate the pros and cons of PGx, to avoid worry or unrealistic expectations. PGx can have different applications and impact depending on the clinical setting it is applied to, e.g., primary care or specialist care. Another important consideration is the prescription of PGx in some groups of patients who can require specific care. in particular, the use of PGx to guide treatment prescription in children/adolescents and in the elderly is discussed. Finally, considerations on the integration of PGx in electronic health records and future research perspectives are presented.",10.23736/S2724-6612.22.02363-6,0,Scopus,85133721581,2-s2.0-85133721581,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133721581
Identification and Impact Analysis of Family History of Psychiatric Disorder in Mood Disorder Patients With Pretrained Language Model,Wan C.,2022,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Mood disorders are ubiquitous mental disorders with familial aggregation. Extracting family history of psychiatric disorders from large electronic hospitalization records is helpful for further study of onset characteristics among patients with a mood disorder. This study uses an observational clinical data set of in-patients of Nanjing Brain Hospital, affiliated with Nanjing Medical University, from the past 10 years. This paper proposes a pretrained language model: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)–Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We first project the electronic hospitalization records into a low-dimensional dense matrix via the pretrained Chinese BERT model, then feed the dense matrix into the stacked CNN layer to capture high-level features of texts; finally, we use the fully connected layer to extract family history based on high-level features.

Effectiveness of embodied conversational agents for managing academic stress at an Indian University (ARU) during COVID-19,Nelekar S.,2022,British Journal of Educational Technology,"Stress has become one of the major reasons for many mental health related issues among students of all age groups, which has resulted in devastating personal losses including suicide. Societal and familial pressure to succeed is high, particularly in developing countries where education is highly valued as a key enabler. As part of stress management during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for online intelligent virtual advisors has risen and, consequently, the need for personalised explanation that is culturally sensitive to the user's context is essential to improve the user's understanding of and trust in the recommendations provided by the virtual advisor. This paper presents the mAnaging stRess at University embodied conversational agent (ECA) that has been adapted for Indian university students from an explainable agent that was found to help Western students reduce their stress by providing study tips with explanations based on the student's beliefs and/or goals. We conducted a research study with sixty students which measured the impact of providing three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief and goal-based explanation) on the students' intentions to change the recommended behaviours and the relationship built with the ECA. The experimental results indicate that there was stress reduction across all student groups provided with different types of explanations. Further, the students showed trust and a good working alliance with the conversational agent, along with an intention to change behaviour across all types of explanations. However, it was observed that the user context played an important role in behaviour change intention and hence explanations could be tailored further, making them culturally more relevant to Indian students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been mostly developed, applied and shown to be effective in developed countries. Hence, their design and development are mostly guided by the intended user's needs and preferences. In a Western context, ECAs have been found to be beneficial for reducing study stress in university students. There is a pertinent need for use of low cost, effective technology that can aid academic stress reduction in higher educational institutions in developing countries owing to their high youth populations, lack of adequate mental healthcare facilities and associated social stigma. What this paper adds The adaptation and use of ECAs to reduce study stress in higher education students in a developing country is evaluated. The ECA technology is adapted for an Indian context in terms of its physical appearance, colour, speech dialect and dialog content so that it is culturally more aligned to the target population. The ECA engages in an empathic conversation tailored for the Indian students and their COVID-19 context providing them with explanation-backed behaviour recommendations that take their beliefs and goals into account. The ECA provides three types of explanation: belief-only; goal-only; and both belief and goal. Results of a study carried out in an Indian university with 61 students, randomly assigned to one of the explanation types, to capture their demographics, study stress statistics, behaviour change intentions and trust/working alliance with the conversational agent. The major findings include stress reduction across all explanation groups, development of a positive relationship between the ECA and the students regardless of its explanation pattern, and changes in behaviour intentions across all types of explanations for all recommended behaviours. However, differences in change intentions for certain behaviours indicate further tailoring of explanations is required based on the user context. Implications for practice and/or policy The ECA technology has shown promise in terms of stress reduction amongst Indian students. Higher Education Institutions in developing countries could utilise low-cost and widely accessible ECAs to overcome lack of access to human-based support and reluctance to use available services due to stigmatized attitudes to mental health issues. This technology can be further improved and deployed into a larger number of Indian educational institutions leading to a widespread impact on overall student health and wellbeing. Digital technologies to support mental health have become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in Western countries. The ECA technology evaluated in our study demonstrates its viability and potential value for use in developing countries, with appropriate tailoring.",10.1111/bjet.13174,22,Scopus,85121470125,2-s2.0-85121470125,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121470125
Development of RehaBot - A Conversational Agent for Promoting Rewarding Activities in Users With Traumatic Brain Injury,Rabinowitz A.R.,2022,Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation,"Objective: In this article, we describe the development and preliminary testing of RehaBot - a chatbot that users communicate with via text messaging designed to augment behavioral activation (BA) treatment of reducing depression and increasing participation in individuals with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Setting: Outpatient brain injury rehabilitation facility. Participants: Outpatient brain injury clinicians and individuals with moderate to severe TBI. Design: Focus groups, software demonstration trials, and single-case experiments with an A-B-A design. Main Measures: System Usability Scale (SUS) and self-reported completed target activities. Results: Focus group feedback guided the development of a flexible system to be used in conjunction with face-to-face therapy, designed to provide reminders, encouragement, and supportive feedback. Two of 3 participants completed all 6 RehaBot tasks independently. One completed 4 tasks independently and a fifth with assistance. Average SUS score in demonstration trials was 76.77 (SD = 21.19). In 4 single-case experiments, participants completed their highest proportion of planned activities in the RehaBot phase and the lowest proportion of planned activities in the reversal phase. They all interacted with RehaBot daily, exchanging an average of 225 messages over the 1-week period, and average SUS score was 95 (SD = 4.74). Their open-ended feedback revealed that participants found RehaBot enjoyable and easy to use. They felt it was a helpful memory aid and promoted better adherence to planned activities by providing accountability and positive reinforcement. Conclusions: This article presents a chatbot development process heavily involving consumer input, which may serve as a model for future development efforts. Our findings provide preliminary evidence suggesting that RehaBot is usable and may promote better adherence to planned target activities. However, future research is needed to establish usability and efficacy of RehaBot and to explore applications of chatbots to other domains of TBI rehabilitation.",10.1097/HTR.0000000000000770,12,Scopus,85132455360,2-s2.0-85132455360,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132455360
COVID Student Study: A Year in the Life of College Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic Through the Lens of Mobile Phone Sensing,Nepal S.,2022,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Proceedings,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the daily life of college students, impacting their social life, education, stress levels and overall mental well-being. We study and assess behavioral changes of N=180 undergraduate college students one year prior to the pandemic as a baseline and then during the first year of the pandemic using mobile phone sensing and behavioral inference. We observe that certain groups of students experience the pandemic very differently. Furthermore, we explore the association of self-reported COVID-19 concern with students' behavior and mental health. We find that heightened COVID-19 concern is correlated with increased depression, anxiety and stress. We evaluate the performance of different deep learning models to classify student COVID-19 concerns with an AUROC and F1 score of 0.70 and 0.71, respectively.

Nomogram predicting bullying victimization in adolescents,Lv J.,2022,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to construct a cross-sectional study to predict the risk of bullying victimization among adolescents. Methods: The study recruited 17,365 Chinese adolescents using stratified random cluster sampling method. The classical regression methods (logistic regression and Lasso regression) and machine learning model were combined to identify the most significant predictors of bullying victimization. Nomogram was built based on multivariable logistic regression model. The discrimination, calibration and generalization of nomogram were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), the calibration curve and a high-quality external validation. Results: Grade, gender, peer violence, family violence, body mass index, family structure, depressive symptoms and Internet addiction, recognized as the best combination, were included in the multivariable regression. The nomogram established based on the non-overfitting multivariable model was verified by internal validation (Area Under Curve: 0.749) and external validation (Area Under Curve: 0.755), showing decent prediction of discrimination, calibration and generalization. Conclusion: Comprehensive nomogram constructed in this study was a useful and convenient tool to evaluate the risk of bullying victimization of adolescents. It is helpful for health-care professionals to assess the risk of bullying victimization among adolescents, and to identify high-risk groups and take more effective preventive measures.",10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.037,32,Scopus,85124728963,2-s2.0-85124728963,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124728963
Psychosis Relapse Prediction Leveraging Electronic Health Records Data and Natural Language Processing Enrichment Methods,Lee D.Y.,2022,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Identifying patients at a high risk of psychosis relapse is crucial for early interventions. A relevant psychiatric clinical context is often recorded in clinical notes; however, the utilization of unstructured data remains limited. This study aimed to develop psychosis-relapse prediction models using various types of clinical notes and structured data. Methods: Clinical data were extracted from the electronic health records of the Ajou University Medical Center in South Korea. The study population included patients with psychotic disorders, and outcome was psychosis relapse within 1 year. Using only structured data, we developed an initial prediction model, then three natural language processing (NLP)-enriched models using three types of clinical notes (psychological tests, admission notes, and initial nursing assessment) and one complete model. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to cluster the clinical context into similar topics. All models applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression algorithm. We also performed an external validation using another hospital database. Results: A total of 330 patients were included, and 62 (18.8%) experienced psychosis relapse. Six predictors were used in the initial model and 10 additional topics from Latent Dirichlet Allocation processing were added in the enriched models. The model derived from all notes showed the highest value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC = 0.946) in the internal validation, followed by models based on the psychological test notes, admission notes, initial nursing assessments, and structured data only (0.902, 0.855, 0.798, and 0.784, respectively). The external validation was performed using only the initial nursing assessment note, and the AUROC was 0.616. Conclusions: We developed prediction models for psychosis relapse using the NLP-enrichment method. Models using clinical notes were more effective than models using only structured data, suggesting the importance of unstructured data in psychosis prediction.",10.3389/fpsyt.2022.844442,14,Scopus,85128765582,2-s2.0-85128765582,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128765582
Comparison of the performance of machine learning-based algorithms for predicting depression and anxiety among University Students in Bangladesh: A result of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,Nayan M.,2022,Asian Journal of Social Health and Behavior,"Introduction: The purpose of this research was to predict mental illness among university students using various machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: A structured questionnaire-based online survey was conducted on 2121 university students (private and public) living in Bangladesh. After obtaining informed consent, the participants completed a web-based survey examining sociodemographic variables and behavioral tests (including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 scale). This study applied six well-known ML algorithms, namely logistic regression, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminate analysis, K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes, and which were used to predict mental illness among university students from Dhaka city in Bangladesh. Results: Of the 2121 eligible respondents, 45% were male and 55% were female, and approximately 76.9% were 21-25 years old. The prevalence of severe depression and severe anxiety was higher for women than for men. Based on various performance parameters, the results of the accuracy assessment showed that RF outperformed other models for the prediction of depression (89% accuracy), while SVM provided the best result than other models for the prediction of anxiety (91.49% accuracy). Conclusion: Based on these findings, we recommend that the RF algorithm and the SVM algorithm were more moderate than any other ML algorithm used in this study to predict the mental health status of university students in Bangladesh (depression and anxiety, respectively). Finally, this study proposes to apply RF and SVM classification when the prediction of mental illness status is the core interest.",10.4103/shb.shb_38_22,44,Scopus,85131623307,2-s2.0-85131623307,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131623307
Machine learning for passive mental health symptom prediction: Generalization across different longitudinal mobile sensing studies,Adler D.A.,2022,Plos One,"Mobile sensing data processed using machine learning models can passively and remotely assess mental health symptoms from the context of patients’ lives. Prior work has trained models using data from single longitudinal studies, collected from demographically homogeneous populations, over short time periods, using a single data collection platform or mobile application. The generalizability of model performance across studies has not been assessed. This study presents a first analysis to understand if models trained using combined longitudinal study data to predict mental health symptoms generalize across current publicly available data. We combined data from the CrossCheck (individuals living with schizophrenia) and StudentLife (university students) studies. In addition to assessing generalizability, we explored if personalizing models to align mobile sensing data, and oversampling less-represented severe symptoms, improved model performance. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) results were reported. Two symptoms (sleep quality and stress) had similar question-response structures across studies and were used as outcomes to explore cross-dataset prediction. Models trained with combined data were more likely to be predictive (significant improvement over predicting training data mean) than models trained with single-study data. Expected model performance improved if the distance between training and validation feature distributions decreased using combined versus single-study data. Personalization aligned each LOSO-CV participant with training data, but only improved predicting CrossCheck stress. Oversampling significantly improved severe symptom classification sensitivity and positive predictive value, but decreased model specificity. Taken together, these results show that machine learning models trained on combined longitudinal study data may generalize across heterogeneous datasets. We encourage researchers to disseminate collected de-identified mobile sensing and mental health symptom data, and further standardize data types collected across studies to enable better assessment of model generalizability.",10.1371/journal.pone.0266516,50,Scopus,85128961126,2-s2.0-85128961126,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128961126

Objective: To review published reports on the association of school closures during broader social lockdown with mental health, health behaviors, and well-being in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years, excluding associations with transmission of infection. Evidence Review: Eleven databases were searched from inception to September 2020, and machine learning was applied for screening articles. A total of 16817 records were screened, 151 were reviewed in full text, and 36 studies were included. Quality assessment was tailored to study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken because data did not allow meta-analysis. Findings: A total of 36 studies from 11 countries were identified, involving a total of 79781 children and adolescents and 18028 parents, which occurred during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February to July 2020). All evaluated school closure as part of broader social lockdown during the first COVID-19 wave, and the duration of school closure ranged from 1 week to 3 months. Of those, 9 (25%) were longitudinal pre-post studies, 5 (14%) were cohort, 21 (58%) were cross-sectional, and 1 (3%) was a modeling study. Thirteen studies (36%) were high quality, 17 (47%) were medium quality, and 6 (17%) were low quality. Twenty-three studies (64%) were published, 8 (22%) were online reports, and 5 (14%) were preprints. Twenty-five studies (69%) concerning mental health identified associations across emotional, behavioral, and restlessness/inattention problems; 18% to 60% of children and adolescents scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms, and 2 studies reported no significant association with suicide. Three studies reported that child protection referrals were lower than expected number of referrals originating in schools. Three studies suggested higher screen time usage, 2 studies reported greater social media use, and 6 studies reported lower physical activity. Studies on sleep (10 studies) and diet (5 studies) provided inconclusive evidence on harms. Conclusions and Relevance: In this narrative synthesis of reports from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies of short-term school closures as part of social lockdown measures reported adverse mental health symptoms and health behaviors among children and adolescents.

Exploring the Relationship between Urban Youth Sentiment and the Built Environment Using Machine Learning and Weibo Comments,Duan S.,2022,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"As the relationship between the built environment and the sense of human experience becomes increasingly important, emotional geography has begun to focus on sentiments in space and time and improving the quality of urban construction from the perspective of public emotion and mental health. While youth is a powerful force in urban construction, there are no studies on the relationship between urban youth sentiments and the built environment. With the development of the Internet, social media has provided a large source of data for the metrics of youth sentiment. Based on data from more than 10,000 geolocated Sina Weibo comments posted over one week (from 19 to 25 July 2021) in Shanghai and using a machine learning algorithm for attention mechanism, this study calculates the sentiment label and sentiment intensity of each comment. Ten elements in five aspects were selected to assess the built environment at different scales and also to explore the correlations between built environment elements and sentiment intensity at different scales. The study finds that the overall sentiment of Shanghai youth tends to be negative. Sentiment intensity is significantly associated with most built environment elements at smaller scales. Urban youth have a higher proportion of both happy and sad sentiments, within which sad sentiments are more closely related to the built environment and are significantly related to all built environment elements. This study uses a deep learning algorithm to improve the accuracy of sentiment classification and confirms that the built environment has a great impact on sentiment. This research can help cities develop built environment optimization measures and policies to create positive emotional environments and enhance the well-being of urban youth.",10.3390/ijerph19084794,17,Scopus,85128178934,2-s2.0-85128178934,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128178934
Annual Research Review: Translational machine learning for child and adolescent psychiatry,Dwyer D.,2022,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines,"Children and adolescents could benefit from the use of predictive tools that facilitate personalized diagnoses, prognoses, and treatment selection. Such tools have not yet been deployed using traditional statistical methods, potentially due to the limitations of the paradigm and the need to leverage large amounts of digital data. This review will suggest that a machine learning approach could address these challenges and is designed to introduce new readers to the background, methods, and results in the field. A rationale is first introduced followed by an outline of fundamental elements of machine learning approaches. To provide an overview of the use of the techniques in child and adolescent literature, a scoping review of broad trends is then presented. Selected studies are also highlighted in order to draw attention to research areas that are closest to translation and studies that exhibit a high degree of experimental innovation. Limitations to the research, and machine learning approaches generally, are outlined in the penultimate section highlighting issues related to sample sizes, validation, clinical utility, and ethical challenges. Finally, future directions are discussed that could enhance the possibility of clinical implementation and address specific questions relevant to the child and adolescent psychiatry.

Impact of Virtual Imaging Technology on Film and Television Production Education of College Students Based on Deep Learning and Internet of Things,Du C.,2022,Frontiers in Psychology,"More and more schools begin to design simulation technology based on virtual imaging technology (VIT) and virtual reality (VR) in their course contents. In particular, among these technical courses, there is a need to first strengthen the Film and Television Production (FTP) education in higher institutions. This article aims to study the impact of VRT, VR, and Internet of things (IoT) technology on FTP courses and audience psychology in higher institutions under the era of intelligent multimedia. How to use emerging VR technology to promote the psychological wellbeing of students or patients has become a new research direction, the exploration of which has a far-reaching significance for the applications of the related technologies. First, the principle and applications of VR and IoT technology are described. Thereon, the deep learning (DL)-based training model is used to analyze the postproduction (PP) of VR-based Sand Table game, and the function and effect of the designed game model are discussed. Subsequently, VR-based Sand Play Therapy (SPT) is applied to mentally ill patients to obtain its therapeutic effect. The results show that the designed VR-based Sand Table game model can be used to treat mentally ill patients and alleviate their negative psychological states. Meanwhile, the Test Anxiety Scale (TAS) scores prove the significant therapeutic effect of the designed game model on the mental problems of patients. Therefore, VR-based psychological SPT can be applied in the stress relief of students and the treatment of mentally ill patients, as well as alleviate their mental health problems. This research provides a new direction and some theoretical support for the application field of VR technology.",10.3389/fpsyg.2021.766634,7,Scopus,85128450341,2-s2.0-85128450341,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128450341
A cognitive behavioural therapy smartphone app for adolescent depression and anxiety: co-design of ClearlyMe,Li S.H.,2022,Cognitive Behaviour Therapist,"Adolescence is associated with heightened vulnerability to symptoms of depression and anxiety. In-person and computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are effective treatment options, yet uptake and engagement remain low. Smartphone delivery of CBT offers an alternative, highly accessible method of delivering CBT. However, there is no freely available CBT smartphone application (app) specifically designed to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. The aim of this study was to design a new CBT smartphone app (ClearlyMe) that targets depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. We engaged in a rigorous co-design process with adolescents (n=36), parents (n=15), and mental health professionals (n=32). Co-design involved: (1) discovery of users' needs, views and preferences by conducting focus groups, (2) defining app features through ideation workshops and user consultations, (3) designing therapeutic CBT content and visual features, and (4) testing prototypes. Users were involved at every step and the process was iterative, with findings carried forward to ensure continued refinement of concepts and features. We found a preference for vibrant, cheerful colours and illustrations and non-endorsement of gamification and chatbots, which contrasted with findings from other studies. Preferences were largely consistent between the three user groups. However, adolescents preferred an app that could be used autonomously without professional support, whereas mental health professionals desired a product for use as a therapy adjunct to support CBT skill development. The importance of co-design, and particularly the inclusion of all stakeholders throughout the entire co-design process, is discussed in relation to the design of ClearlyMe. Key learning aims (1) To understand the co-design process that underpins the development of a new CBT smartphone app for youth with elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety. (2) To understand adolescent, parent and mental health professionals' key preferences regarding the features and functionality of a CBT smartphone app for adolescents with elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety. (3) To understand how ClearlyMe has been designed as both a therapy adjunct and stand-alone program, and how it can be incorporated into day-to-day clinical practice.",10.1017/S1754470X22000095,28,Scopus,85127459391,2-s2.0-85127459391,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127459391
Who Is at Risk of Poor Mental Health Following Coronavirus Disease-19 Outpatient Management?,Hüfner K.,2022,Frontiers in Medicine,"Background: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) convalescents are at risk of developing a de novo mental health disorder or worsening of a pre-existing one. COVID-19 outpatients have been less well characterized than their hospitalized counterparts. The objectives of our study were to identify indicators for poor mental health following COVID-19 outpatient management and to identify high-risk individuals. Methods: We conducted a binational online survey study with adult non-hospitalized COVID-19 convalescents (Austria/AT: n = 1,157, Italy/IT: n = 893). Primary endpoints were positive screening for depression and anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-4) and self-perceived overall mental health (OMH) and quality of life (QoL) rated with 4 point Likert scales. Psychosocial stress was surveyed with a modified PHQ stress module. Associations of the mental health and QoL with socio-demographic, COVID-19 course, and recovery variables were assessed by multi-parameter Random Forest and Poisson modeling. Mental health risk subsets were defined by self-organizing maps (SOMs) and hierarchical clustering algorithms. The survey analyses are publicly available (https://im2-ibk.shinyapps.io/mental_health_dashboard/). Results: Depression and/or anxiety before infection was reported by 4.6% (IT)/6% (AT) of participants. At a median of 79 days (AT)/96 days (IT) post-COVID-19 onset, 12.4% (AT)/19.3% (IT) of subjects were screened positive for anxiety and 17.3% (AT)/23.2% (IT) for depression. Over one-fifth of the respondents rated their OMH (AT: 21.8%, IT: 24.1%) or QoL (AT: 20.3%, IT: 25.9%) as fair or poor. Psychosocial stress, physical performance loss, high numbers of acute and sub-acute COVID-19 complaints, and the presence of acute and sub-acute neurocognitive symptoms (impaired concentration, confusion, and forgetfulness) were the strongest correlates of deteriorating mental health and poor QoL. In clustering analysis, these variables defined subsets with a particularly high propensity of post-COVID-19 mental health impairment and decreased QoL. Pre-existing depression or anxiety (DA) was associated with an increased symptom burden during acute COVID-19 and recovery. Conclusion: Our study revealed a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and mental health. We put forward specific acute symptoms of the disease as “red flags” of mental health deterioration, which should prompt general practitioners to identify non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients who may benefit from early psychological and psychiatric intervention.

Exploration and Strategy Analysis of Mental Health Education for Students in Sports Majors in the Era of Artificial Intelligence,Liang L.,2022,Frontiers in Psychology,"This study aims to explore new educational strategies suitable for the mental health education of college students. Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are combined to evaluate the mental health education of college students in sports majors. First, the research status on the mental health education of college students is introduced. The internet of things (IoT) on mental health education, a structure based on big data and convolutional neural network (CNN), is constructed. Next, the survey design and questionnaire survey are carried out. Finally, the questionnaire data are analyzed and compared with the mental health status under traditional education. The results show that the CNN model has good accuracy and ability to distinguish symptoms, so it can be applied to the existing psychological work in colleges. In the symptom comparison survey, under the traditional education and big data network, the number of college students with mild mental health problems is found to be 158 (84.9%) and 170 (91.4%), respectively. It indicates that the number of college students with moderate mental health problems decreases significantly. In the comparative investigation of the severity of mental problems, the number of students with normal mental health, subhealth, and serious mental health problems under the background of traditional mental health education is 125 (67.2%), 56 (30.1%), and 5 (2.7%), respectively. The mental health status of college students under the influence of big data networks on mental health education is better than that of traditional mental health education. There are 140 students with normal mental health, a year-on-year increase of 16.7%. In the comparative survey of specific mental disorders, students with obsessive-compulsive symptoms under traditional mental health education account for 22.0% of the total sample, having the largest proportion. In the subhealth psychological group under the big data network on mental health education, the number of hostile students decreases by 7, which is the psychological factor with the most obvious improvement. Hence, the proposed path of mental health education is feasible.",10.3389/fpsyg.2021.762725,24,Scopus,85127183612,2-s2.0-85127183612,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127183612
Raising Awareness of Smartphone Overuse among University Students: A Persuasive Systems Approach,Abreu C.,2022,Informatics,"Smartphone overuse can lead to a series of physical, mental and social disturbances. This problem is more prevalent among young adults as compared to other demographic groups. Additionally, university students are already undergoing high cognitive loads and stress conditions; therefore, they are more susceptible to smartphone addiction and its derived problems. In this paper, we present a novel approach where a conversational mobile agent uses persuasive messages exploring the reflective mind to raise users’ awareness of their usage and consequently induce reduction behaviors. We conducted a four-week study with 16 university students undergoing stressful conditions—a global lockdown during their semester—and evaluated the impact of the agent on smartphone usage reduction and the perceived usefulness of such an approach. Results show the efficacy of self-tracking in the behavior change process: 81% of the users reduced their usage time, and all of them mentioned that having a conversational agent alerting them about their usage was useful. Before this experiment, only 68% of them considered such an approach could be useful. In conclusion, users deemed it essential to have an engaging conversational agent on their smartphones, in terms of helping them become more aware of usage times.",10.3390/informatics9010015,7,Scopus,85125358833,2-s2.0-85125358833,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125358833
Using AI chatbots to provide self-help depression interventions for university students: A randomized trial of effectiveness,Liu H.,2022,Internet Interventions,"Background: Depression impacts the lives of a large number of university students. Mobile-based therapy chatbots are increasingly being used to help young adults who suffer from depression. However, previous trials have short follow-up periods. Evidence of effectiveness in pragmatic conditions are still in lack. Objective: This study aimed to compare chatbot therapy to bibliotherapy, which is a widely accepted and proven-useful self-help psychological intervention. The main objective of this study is to add to the evidence of effectiveness for chatbot therapy as a convenient, affordable, interactive self-help intervention for depression. Methods: An unblinded randomized controlled trial with 83 university students was conducted. The participants were randomly assigned to either a chatbot test group (n = 41) to receive a newly developed chatbot-delivered intervention, or a bibliotherapy control group (n = 42) to receive a minimal level of bibliotherapy. A set of questionnaires was implemented as measurements of clinical variables at baseline and every 4 weeks for a period of 16 weeks, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) were used to measure satisfaction and therapeutic alliance after the intervention. Participants' self-reported adherence and feedback on the therapy chatbot were also collected. Results: Participants were all university students (undergraduate students (n = 31), postgraduate students (n = 52)). They were between 19 and 28 years old (mean = 23.08, standard deviation (SD) = 1.76) and 55.42% (46/83) female. 24.07% (20/83) participants were lost to follow-up. No significant group difference was found at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, individuals in the chatbot test group showed a significant reduction in the PHQ-9 scores (F = 22.89; P < 0.01) and the GAD-7 scores (F = 5.37; P = 0.02). Follow-up analysis of completers suggested that the reduction of anxiety was significant only in the first 4 weeks. The WAI-SR scores in the chatbot group were higher compared to the bibliotherapy group (t = 7.29; P < 0.01). User feedback showed that process factors were more influential than the content factors. Conclusions: The chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention was proven to be superior to the minimal level of bibliotherapy in terms of reduction on depression, anxiety, and therapeutic alliance achieved with participants.",10.1016/j.invent.2022.100495,161,Scopus,85122523146,2-s2.0-85122523146,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122523146
"An Internet-Based Multi-Approach Intervention Targeting University Students Suffering from Psychological Problems: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation",De Fabritiis M.,2022,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Despite the widespread prevalence of mental health problems, most psychological distress remains untreated. Internet-based psychological interventions can be an essential tool for increasing treatment availability and accessibility. The main objective of the MindBlooming project is to design and implement an innovative Internet-based multi-approach treatment for university students suffering from psychological or physical problems. The intervention will focus on symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep problems, self-destructive thoughts, job-and study-related stress and burnout, and chronic pain. It will be based on different approaches, primarily psychoeducation, Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CBT), and third-wave CBT. At the end of the treatment, user satisfaction and usability will be assessed. In addition, two further aims will be evaluating the treatment efficacy through a randomized controlled trial and tuning a predictive model through Machine Learning techniques. The intervention consists of a 7-week treatment on two problematic areas according to each students’ personal needs, identified through an initial assessment. Besides the treatment assigned following the initial screening, participants will also be assigned to a different module to improve their relational skills. The treatment, which can be accessed through a mobile app, consists of psychoeducational videos followed by related exercises.

Artificial Intelligence Tools for Suicide Prevention in Adolescents and Young Adults,Gupta M.,2022,Adolescent Psychiatry,"Background: Artificial Intelligence is making a significant transformation in human lives. Its application in the medical and healthcare field has also been observed to make an impact and improve overall outcomes. There has been a quest for similar processes in mental health due to the lack of observable changes in the areas of suicide prevention. In the last five years, there has been an emerging body of empirical research applying the technology of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in mental health. Objective: To review the clinical applicability of the AI/ML-based tools in suicide prevention. Methods: The compelling question of predicting suicidality has been the focus of this research. We performed a broad literature search and then identified 36 articles relevant to meet the objectives of this review. We review the available evidence and provide a brief overview of the advances in this field. Conclusion: In the last five years, there has been more evidence supporting the implementation of these algorithms in clinical practice. Its current clinical utility is limited to using electronic health records and could be highly effective in conjunction with existing tools for suicide prevention.

Researching the Links Between Smartphone Behavior and Adolescent Well-being With the FUTURE-WP4 (Modeling the Future: Understanding the Impact of Technology on Adolescent's Well-being Work Package 4) Project: Protocol for an Ecological Momentary Assessment Study,Elavsky S.,2022,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Smartphone ownership has increased among teens within the last decade, with up to 89% of adolescents owning a smartphone and engaging daily with the online world through it. Although the results of recent meta-analyses suggest that engaging digital technology plays only a small role in adolescent well-being, parents, professionals, and policymakers remain concerned about the impact that the instant connectivity of smartphones has on adolescent well-being. Objective: Herein, we introduce the protocol of a research study investigating the associations between adolescent smartphone use and different facets of well-being (social, physical, and psychological), with the aim to apply innovative methods to address the limitations of existing empirical studies. Methods: This 12-month prospective study of adolescents uses a repeated measurement-burst design with the ecological momentary assessment methodology. Adolescents (N=203; age range 13-17 years) complete baseline assessments through online questionnaires, four 14-day intensive data collection bursts, and an online questionnaire at the end of the study. As part of the 4 measurement bursts, adolescent smartphone behavior is assessed objectively by passive data collection of smartphone data logs and through self-reports in short questionnaires administered via a custom-built Android app. Results: The protocol describes the study objectives, research tools (including the development of the Android app and specialized software), and process (including pilot studies, the main study, and targets for machine learning approaches). Two of the 203 enrolled participants provided no data during the first data collection burst of the main study. Preliminary analyses of the data from the first data collection burst indicated an acceptable level of compliance (72.25%) with the daily questionnaires. The design of the study will allow for the assessment of both within- and between-person variabilities in smartphone behavior, as well as short-term variation and long-term change in smartphone behavior and how it impacts the indicators of social, physical, and psychological well-being. Conclusions: The innovative methods applied in this study (objective smartphone logs, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning) will allow for a more nuanced assessment of the links between smartphone use and well-being, informing strategies to help adolescents navigate the online world more constructively in terms of the development of their physical, social, and psychological well-being.",10.2196/35984,10,Scopus,85126136717,2-s2.0-85126136717,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126136717
Use of Mobile and Wearable Artificial Intelligence in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: Scoping Review,Welch V.,2022,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Mental health disorders are a leading cause of medical disabilities across an individual's lifespan. This burden is particularly substantial in children and adolescents because of challenges in diagnosis and the lack of precision medicine approaches. However, the widespread adoption of wearable devices (eg, smart watches) that are conducive for artificial intelligence applications to remotely diagnose and manage psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents is promising. Objective: This study aims to conduct a scoping review to study, characterize, and identify areas of innovations with wearable devices that can augment current in-person physician assessments to individualize diagnosis and management of psychiatric disorders in child and adolescent psychiatry. Methods: This scoping review used information from the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A comprehensive search of several databases from 2011 to June 25, 2021, limited to the English language and excluding animal studies, was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE and Epub ahead of print, in-process and other nonindexed citations, and daily; Ovid Embase; Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Web of Science; and Scopus. Results: The initial search yielded 344 articles, from which 19 (5.5%) articles were left on the final source list for this scoping review. Articles were divided into three main groups as follows: studies with the main focus on autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and internalizing disorders such as anxiety disorders. Most of the studies used either cardio-fitness chest straps with electrocardiogram sensors or wrist-worn biosensors, such as watches by Fitbit. Both allowed passive data collection of the physiological signals. Conclusions: Our scoping review found a large heterogeneity of methods and findings in artificial intelligence studies in child psychiatry. Overall, the largest gap identified in this scoping review is the lack of randomized controlled trials, as most studies available were pilot studies and feasibility trials.",10.2196/33560,66,Scopus,85126422214,2-s2.0-85126422214,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126422214
Tracking Subjective Sleep Quality and Mood With Mobile Sensing: Multiverse Study,Niemeijer K.,2022,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Sleep influences moods and mood disorders. Existing methods for tracking the quality of people's sleep are laborious and obtrusive. If a method were available that would allow effortless and unobtrusive tracking of sleep quality, it would mark a significant step toward obtaining sleep data for research and clinical applications. Objective: Our goal was to evaluate the potential of mobile sensing data to obtain information about a person's sleep quality. For this purpose, we investigated to what extent various automatically gathered mobile sensing features are capable of predicting (1) subjective sleep quality (SSQ), (2) negative affect (NA), and (3) depression; these variables are associated with objective sleep quality. Through a multiverse analysis, we examined how the predictive quality varied as a function of the selected sensor, the extracted feature, various preprocessing options, and the statistical prediction model. Methods: We used data from a 2-week trial where we collected mobile sensing and experience sampling data from an initial sample of 60 participants. After data cleaning and removing participants with poor compliance, we retained 50 participants. Mobile sensing data involved the accelerometer, charging status, light sensor, physical activity, screen activity, and Wi-Fi status. Instructions were given to participants to keep their smartphone charged and connected to Wi-Fi at night. We constructed 1 model for every combination of multiverse parameters to evaluate their effects on each of the outcome variables. We evaluated the statistical models by applying them to training, validation, and test sets to prevent overfitting. Results: Most models (on either of the outcome variables) were not informative on the validation set (ie, predicted R2≤0). However, our best models achieved R2 values of 0.658, 0.779, and 0.074 for SSQ, NA, and depression, respectively on the training set and R2 values of 0.348, 0.103, and 0.025, respectively on the test set. Conclusions: The approach demonstrated in this paper has shown that different choices (eg, preprocessing choices, various statistical models, different features) lead to vastly different results that are bad and relatively good as well. Nevertheless, there were some promising results, particularly for SSQ, which warrant further research on this topic.",10.2196/25643,12,Scopus,85126719369,2-s2.0-85126719369,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126719369
Evaluation of Machine Learning Techniques to Predict the Likelihood of Mental Health Conditions Following a First mTBI,Dabek F.,2022,Frontiers in Neurology,"Objective: Limited research has evaluated the utility of machine learning models and longitudinal data from electronic health records (EHR) to forecast mental health outcomes following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective of this study is to assess various data science and machine learning techniques and determine their efficacy in forecasting mental health (MH) conditions among active duty Service Members (SMs) following a first diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Materials and Methods: Patient demographics and encounter metadata of 35,451 active duty SMs who have sustained an initial mTBI, as documented within the EHR, were obtained. All encounter records from a year prior and post index mTBI date were collected. Patient demographics, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 codes, enhanced diagnostic related groups, and other risk factors estimated from the year prior to index mTBI were utilized to develop a feature vector representative of each patient. To embed temporal information into the feature vector, various window configurations were devised. Finally, the presence or absence of mental health conditions post mTBI index date were used as the outcomes variable for the models. Results: When evaluating the machine learning models, neural network techniques showed the best overall performance in identifying patients with new or persistent mental health conditions post mTBI. Various window configurations were tested and results show that dividing the observation window into three distinct date windows [−365:−30, −30:0, 0:14] provided the best performance. Overall, the models described in this paper identified the likelihood of developing MH conditions at [14:90] days post-mTBI with an accuracy of 88.2%, an AUC of 0.82, and AUC-PR of 0.66. Discussion: Through the development and evaluation of different machine learning models we have validated the feasibility of designing algorithms to forecast the likelihood of developing mental health conditions after the first mTBI. Patient attributes including demographics, symptomatology, and other known risk factors proved to be effective features to employ when training ML models for mTBI patients. When patient attributes and features are estimated at different time window, the overall performance increase illustrating the importance of embedding temporal information into the models. The addition of temporal information not only improved model performance, but also increased interpretability and clinical utility. Conclusion: Predictive analytics can be a valuable tool for understanding the effects of mTBI, particularly when identifying those individuals at risk of negative outcomes. The translation of these models from retrospective study into real-world validation models is imperative in the mitigation of negative outcomes with appropriate and timely interventions.",10.3389/fneur.2021.769819,5,Scopus,85124885859,2-s2.0-85124885859,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124885859
Evaluating the Feasibility and Acceptability of an Artificial-Intelligence-Enabled and Speech-Based Distress Screening Mobile App for Adolescents and Young Adults Diagnosed with Cancer: A Study Protocol,Zhang A.,2022,Cancers,"Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer are an age-defined population, with studies reporting up to 45% of the population experiencing psychological distress. Although it is essential to screen and monitor for psychological distress throughout AYAs’ cancer journeys, many cancer centers fail to effectively implement distress screening protocols largely due to busy clinical workflow and survey fatigue. Recent advances in mobile technology and speech science have enabled flexible and engaging methods to monitor psychological distress. However, patient-centered research focusing on these methods’ feasibility and acceptability remains lacking. Therefore, in this project, we aim to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled and speech-based mobile application to monitor psychological distress among AYAs diagnosed with cancer. We use a single-arm prospective cohort design with a stratified sampling strategy. We aim to recruit 60 AYAs diagnosed with cancer and to monitor their psychological distress using an AI-enabled speech-based distress monitoring tool over a 6 month period. The primary feasibility endpoint of this study is defined by the number of participants completing four out of six monthly distress assessments, and the acceptability endpoint is defined both quantitatively using the acceptability of intervention measure and qualitatively using semi-structured interviews.",10.3390/cancers14040914,11,Scopus,85124352045,2-s2.0-85124352045,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124352045
Sustainable Technology for Adolescents and youth to Reduce Stress (STARS): a WHO transdiagnostic chatbot for distressed youth,Hall J.,2022,World Psychiatry,,10.1002/wps.20947,15,Scopus,85122959796,2-s2.0-85122959796,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122959796
Text Messaging Intervention for Mental Wellness in American Indian and Alaska Native Teens and Young Adults (BRAVE Study): Analysis of User Engagement Patterns,Wrobel J.,2022,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Many American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN or Native) communities express concern about high rates of suicide and poor mental health. Technology-based health interventions that nurture resilience, coping skills, connectedness, and help-seeking skills may be an effective strategy for promoting health and wellbeing among AI/AN youth. The Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board designed the BRAVE intervention for AI/AN youth. BRAVE is delivered via SMS text messaging and includes role model videos, mental wellness strategies, links to culturally relevant resources, and social support from family and friends. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore system data from the BRAVE intervention to determine patterns of user engagement and differences in psychosocial outcomes based on the number of clicks on BRAVE content. Methods: The BRAVE study included 1030 AI/AN teens and young adults nationwide (15 to 24 years old). The message series in the BRAVE and STEM study arms included 3 to 5 SMS text messages per week, featuring 1 role model video and 1 image per week. Messages were sent out via Mobile Commons (Upland Software Inc), a mobile messaging provider that supports text, picture, and video SMS. Results: Of the 509 participants in the original BRAVE analysis, 270 had sufficient data to analyze user engagement, with at least 1 trackable click on a study SMS text message. Of the 270, 184 (68.1%) were female, 50 (18.5%) were male, and 36 (13.3%) selected another gender category. The average participant was 20.6 years old, with a minimum and maximum age of 15 and 26 years. Most participants had relatively low engagement measured by the number of clicks (median 2; mean 3.4), although others clicked message content as many as 49 times. Users engaged most frequently with the YouTube-based content (viewing 1 of 7 role model videos), with 64.8% (175/270) of total clicks coming from the role model videos, and earlier episodes receiving the highest number of clicks. Most baseline psychosocial measures were not significantly associated with the number of links clicked. However, help-seeking behavior was highly significant (P<.001), with a rate ratio of 0.82 (0.73, 0.92), indicating that each 1-unit increase in help-seeking score at baseline was associated with an 18% decrease in the expected number of study content clicks. Conclusions: This is the first study to set initial standards for assessing user engagement in an mHealth intervention. Our work underscores the feasibility of exploring the impact of engagement on intended outcomes, allowing for more precise exploration of the dose-response relationship that may be realized through these low-touch interventions that offer promising potential for reaching high numbers of program participants.",10.2196/32138,9,Scopus,85126134950,2-s2.0-85126134950,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126134950
Digital biomarkers of anxiety disorder symptom changes: Personalized deep learning models using smartphone sensors accurately predict anxiety symptoms from ecological momentary assessments,Jacobson N.C.,2022,Behaviour Research and Therapy,"Smartphones are capable of passively capturing persons’ social interactions, movement patterns, physiological activation, and physical environment. Nevertheless, little research has examined whether momentary anxiety symptoms can be accurately assessed using these methodologies. In this research, we utilize smartphone sensors and personalized deep learning models to predict future anxiety symptoms among a sample reporting clinical anxiety disorder symptoms. Participants (N = 32) with generalized anxiety disorder and/or social anxiety disorder (based on self-report) installed a smartphone application and completed ecological momentary assessment symptoms assessing their anxiety and avoidance symptoms hourly for the course of one week (T = 2007 assessments). During the same period, the smartphone app collected information about physiological activation (heart rate and heart rate variability), exposure to light, social contact, and GPS location. GPS locations were coded to reveal the type of location and the weather information. Personalized deep learning models using the smartphone sensor data were capable of predicting the majority of total variation in anxiety symptoms (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.748) and predicting a large proportion of within-person variation at the hour-by-hour level (mean R<sup>2</sup> = 0.385). These results suggest that personalized deep learning models using smartphone sensor data are capable of accurately predicting future anxiety disorder symptom changes.",10.1016/j.brat.2021.104013,57,Scopus,85123308446,2-s2.0-85123308446,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123308446
Exploring variables related to medical surrogate decision-making accuracy during the COVID-19 pandemic,Spalding R.L.,2022,Patient Education and Counseling,"Objective: Surrogate medical decision making is common in the United States healthcare system. Variables that may influence surrogate decision making have been proposed. Little work has examined relations between these variables and outcomes of surrogate decision making. This study investigated whether surrogates’ characteristics, including their knowledge of treatment options, and interpersonal factors predicted surrogates’ accuracy and intervention selections. Specifically, predictor variables included: trust in the medical profession, trait-level anxiety, depression, anxiety about COVID-19, religiosity, perceived emotional support, understanding of treatment options, empathy, willingness to accept responsibility for medical decisions, reluctance to burden others, and perceived similarity between oneself and the patient. Methods: 154 pairs of patients and their surrogates completed an online survey. Patients indicated preferred treatments in hypothetical decision scenarios. Surrogates indicated the treatment that they thought the patient would prefer. Results: When taken all together in a predictive model, the variables significantly predicted surrogatesʼ accuracy, F (6) = 3.03, R<sup>2</sup> = .12, p = .008. Variables also predicted selection of intensive interventions, F (4) = 5.95, R<sup>2</sup> = .14, p = .00. Surrogates reporting greater anxiety about COVID-19 selected more intensive interventions. Conclusions: Consistent with prior research, this study found that surrogates’ characteristics influence the interventions they choose, with anxiety about COVID-19 having considerable bearing on their chosen interventions. Practice implications: These findings can inform development of decision-making interventions to improve surrogates’ accuracy. Providers may attend to variables highlighted by this study to support surrogates, particularly within the stressful context of COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.",10.1016/j.pec.2021.06.011,13,Scopus,85108106173,2-s2.0-85108106173,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108106173
Assessing Inequities in COVID-19 Vaccine Roll-Out Strategy Programs: A Cross-Country Study Using a Machine Learning Approach,Kazemi M.,2022,Vaccines,"After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and its spread across the world, countries have adopted containment measures to stop its transmission, limit fatalities, and relieve hospitals from straining and overwhelming conditions imposed by the virus. Many countries implemented social distancing and lockdown strategies that negatively impacted their economies and the psychological wellbeing of their citizens, even though they contributed to saving lives. Recently approved and available, COVID-19 vaccines can provide a really viable and sustainable option for controlling the pandemic. However, their uptake represents a global challenge due to vaccine hesitancy and logistic– organizational hurdles that have made its distribution stagnant in several developed countries despite several appeals by the media, policy-and decision-makers, and community leaders. Vaccine distribution is also a concern in developing countries, where there is a scarcity of doses. The objective of the present study was to set up a metric to assess vaccination uptake and identify national socio-economic factors influencing this indicator. We conducted a cross-country study. We first estimated the vaccination uptake rate across countries by fitting a logistic model to reported daily case numbers. Using the uptake rate, we estimated the vaccine roll-out index. Next, we used Random Forest, an “off-the-shelf” machine learning algorithm, to study the association between vaccination uptake rate and socio-economic factors. We found that the mean vaccine roll-out index is 0.016 (standard deviation 0.016), with a range between 0.0001 (Haiti) and 0.0829 (Mongolia). The top four factors associated with the vaccine roll-out index are the median per capita income, human development index, percentage of individuals who have used the internet in the last three months, and health expenditure per capita. The still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the disparity in vaccine adoption across low-and high-income countries, which represents a global public health challenge. We must pave the way for universal access to vaccines and other approved treatments, regardless of demographic structures and underlying health conditions. Income disparity remains, instead, an important cause of vaccine inequity, which restricts the functioning of the global vaccine allocation framework and, thus, the ending of the pandemic. Stronger mechanisms are needed to foster countries’ political willingness to promote vaccine and drug access equity in a globalized society where future pandemics and other global health crises can be anticipated.",10.3390/vaccines10020194,16,Scopus,85124048495,2-s2.0-85124048495,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124048495

A nationally representative Qualtrics panel sample consisting of 441 adolescents (M<inf>age</inf> = 17.3; SD<inf>age</inf> = 1.67) participated in this study. The results of a three-step hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that gender, social media usage, and mattering were most strongly associated with adolescent distress (i.e., anxiety/depressive symptom reporting). For the full predictive model with all six predictors added, mattering was found to significantly improve the prediction of adolescents’ anxiety/depressive symptomatology, contributing an additional 12.8% of explained variance. For this sample, adolescent girls participants reported experiencing more anxiety/depressive symptoms. Furthermore, higher levels of social media usage, indicative of an addictive stage, and lower levels of mattering were related to more significant anxiety/depressive symptomatology. Overall, mattering was found to significantly correlate with adolescent distress, online activity, problematic social media usage, and school connectedness, evidencing its importance in addressing adolescent mental health.",10.1177/07342829211050536,35,Scopus,85117088967,2-s2.0-85117088967,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117088967
Measuring and Modeling the Effect of Audio on Human Focus in Everyday Environments Using Brain-Computer Interface Technology,Haruvi A.,2022,Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,"The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of audio listened to through headphones on subjectively reported human focus levels, and to identify through objective measures the properties that contribute most to increasing and decreasing focus in people within their regular, everyday environment. Participants (N = 62, 18–65 years) performed various tasks on a tablet computer while listening to either no audio (silence), popular audio playlists designed to increase focus (pre-recorded music arranged in a particular sequence of songs), or engineered soundscapes that were personalized to individual listeners (digital audio composed in real-time based on input parameters such as heart rate, time of day, location, etc.). Audio stimuli were delivered to participants through headphones while their brain signals were simultaneously recorded by a portable electroencephalography headband. Participants completed four 1-h long sessions at home during which different audio played continuously in the background. Using brain-computer interface technology for brain decoding and based on an individual’s self-report of their focus, we obtained individual focus levels over time and used this data to analyze the effects of various properties of the sounds contained in the audio content. We found that while participants were working, personalized soundscapes increased their focus significantly above silence (p = 0.008), while music playlists did not have a significant effect. For the young adult demographic (18–36 years), all audio tested was significantly better than silence at producing focus (p = 0.001–0.009). Personalized soundscapes increased focus the most relative to silence, but playlists of pre-recorded songs also increased focus significantly during specific time intervals. Ultimately we found it is possible to accurately predict human focus levels a priori based on physical properties of audio content. We then applied this finding to compare between music genres and revealed that classical music, engineered soundscapes, and natural sounds were the best genres for increasing focus, while pop and hip-hop were the worst. These insights can enable human and artificial intelligence composers to produce increases or decreases in listener focus with high temporal (millisecond) precision. Future research will include real-time adaptation of audio for other functional objectives beyond affecting focus, such as affecting listener enjoyment, drowsiness, stress and memory.",10.3389/fncom.2021.760561,5,Scopus,85124515090,2-s2.0-85124515090,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124515090
Construction of Mental Health Education Model for College Students Based on Fine-Grained Parallel Computing Programming,Hong J.,2022,Scientific Programming,"Psychological education is beneficial in maintaining the psychological health of college students, resolving psychological issues, and creating a harmonious campus and society. Mental health education for college students is a development-oriented basic education activity that contributes significantly to educational quality. To improve the accuracy of college students' mental health assessments, a model for mental health education for college students based on fine-grained parallel computing programming is proposed. This study uses a deep learning algorithm to subdivide the classification of an emotion dictionary, which can be classified by adding negative word lists, polarity conversion dictionaries, and online dictionaries, among other things, based on the theory of ecological instantaneous evaluation. It can be used for both multiclass and detailed emotion analysis. The model is more accurate in assessing the mental health of college students, according to the results of the study.

Research on Psychological Emotion Recognition of College Students Based on Deep Learning,Li Y.,2022,Scientific Programming,"College students' anxiety, depression, inferiority complex, interpersonal sensitivity, and a series of mental health problems have a very serious negative impact on individuals, families, and society. In order to obtain better psychological emotion recognition effect of college students, this paper proposes a psychological emotion recognition algorithm based on multisource data. One-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) was used to mine students' online patterns from online behavior sequences. According to the consumption data of students in the canteen, abnormal scores are calculated to depict the dietary differences among students. At the same time, the students' psychological state data provided by the psychological center are used as labels to improve the shortcomings of the questionnaire. Five kinds of common classification algorithms are trained by training set, and the classifier with the best effect is selected through evaluation of verification set, which is used to identify students with mental health problems in the test set.

Detecting Depression from Social Media Data as a Multiple-Instance Learning Task,Mann P.,2022,2022 10th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Acii 2022,"Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is a mental condition that causes severe impairments in a person's life. Early detection of such a condition is imperative, especially to detect cases where the person does not even know that they are affected by it. Social media provide a ubiquitous platform with self-generated data that Machine Learning models enhanced with Natural Language Processing mechanisms can extensively explore. Nonetheless, we advocate that previous Machine Learning approaches to early detection of MDD do not adequately model the problem at hand. Most assume that the isolated publications on social media are enough for early detection. This paper proposes a new problem formulation for this task using the multiple-instance learning paradigm. Furthermore, we include a theoretical and experimental analysis of the method on a dataset of Brazilian university students using the transformer and LSTM architectures. The results indicate that the proposed approach yields better accuracy and explanation capabilities than previous studies that do not rely on multiple-instance learning.",10.1109/ACII55700.2022.9953811,6,Scopus,85143785099,2-s2.0-85143785099,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143785099
Design of Psychological Well-Being Education Environment Scheme Based on Deep Learning Theory,Guo L.,2022,Journal of Environmental and Public Health,"This paper discusses the structure of psychological well-being education programmes in higher education institutions based on an analysis of the connotation and characteristics of deep learning theory, as well as the background of today's talent training requirements, the psychological traits of contemporary students, and the practical requirements of the teaching reform of psychological well-being education courses in higher education institutions. A model for evaluating the psychological well-being of college students based on BPNN is presented in this paper, which also addresses the current severe shortage of full-time psychological counsellors. Additionally, the traditional BPNN is optimised by GA, and the resulting NN can better achieve the desired effect, demonstrating the viability of BPNN. It enables the psychological well-being of college students to be self-diagnosed online and significantly lessens the workload of psychological counselling institutions in higher education. According to the experimental findings, the optimised algorithm's accuracy can reach 92.47 percent, and it is considered to be reliable. This study not only offers a novel approach to nonlinear data processing, but also paves the way for variable screening in the presence of an ambiguous structure. Additionally, in a limited sense, it offers insightful research for psychological education in higher education institutions.",10.1155/2022/3460830,4,Scopus,85137674686,2-s2.0-85137674686,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137674686

The Design of Psychological Education Intervention System in Universities Based on Deep Learning,Wang Y.,2022,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"With the rapid development of Chinese society and economy as well as the deepening of the reform of the higher education management system and the change of employment mode of graduates, college students face various challenges of frustration and pressure in the areas of value and ethical concepts, interpersonal relationships, behavior, life, and employment. Some students who are relatively fragile psychologically are unable to bear the heavy pressure of frustration and challenges, and are prone to psychological crisis, overreacting, and even hurting others or self-injury or suicide. How to solve the current psychological problems of college students and help them become adults and talents is a new task and a serious challenge for college students' mental health education under the new situation. With the development of the Internet, more and more people are expressing their emotions in social networks, including suicidal intentions, which creates new opportunities for suicide prevention. If suicide risk can be automatically identified using microblogs, it can open up new directions for suicide prevention efforts. This paper is based on the use of deep learning to build a social media suicide identifier to explore the possibility of assessing individual users' suicide in real time through social platforms. To verify the effectiveness of this algorithmic model, the keyword attributes used by the algorithm are statistically analyzed and compared with the prediction results of two other algorithmic models. The experimental results show that the algorithmic model based on deep learning can be more effective in predicting the suicide risk of microblog users.",10.1155/2022/9208172,2,Scopus,85131850197,2-s2.0-85131850197,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131850197

Machine learning based analysis and prediction of college students' mental health during COVID-19 in India,Nanda A.,2022,Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and Mental Health in Pandemics A Computational Approach,"The traditional education system is focused on peer-to-peer learning, which helps in engagement, interactivity, and building confidence in students. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the focus from the traditional education system to online learning. The radical change in the education system has increased the mental stress in students. The parameters that affect the mental health of students include: anxiety, academic stress, difficulty in concentrating, sleeping pattern disorders, decreased social interaction, job fear, etc. In this work, we design a modular framework for predicting the students' mental health based on a set of questions. First, we create a questionnaire to assess and analyze the parameters associated with mental health among college students in the Indian context. Based on these parameters, we first survey 600 students from Indian universities. Then, we categorize the students into two groups: high mental stress and low mental stress using k-means clustering. Using the labels identified by k-means and further validated by the students, we then apply different classification models to predict the class of students. The proposed framework is experimentally validated through the dataset created from the questionnaire. In addition, we also analyze students' responses to find the parameters of utmost concern to the students. Therefore, our proposed work can be used to find the mental stress level of students so that corrective actions can be taken.",10.1016/B978-0-323-91196-2.00001-6,7,Scopus,85137609747,2-s2.0-85137609747,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137609747

A Personalized Conversational Agent to Treat Depression in Youth and Young Adults – A Transdisciplinary Design Science Research Project,Kuhlmeier F.O.,2022,Lecture Notes in Computer Science Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics,"Depression is a large-scale and consequential problem in youth and young adults. Conversational agents (CAs) can contribute to addressing current barriers to seeking treatment, such as long waiting lists, and reduce the high dropout rates reported for other digital health interventions. However, existing CAs have not considered differences between youth and adults and are primarily designed based on a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach that neglects individual symptoms and preferences. Therefore, we propose a theory-driven design for personalized CAs to treat depression in youth and young adults. Based on interviews with patients (i.e., people diagnosed with depression), we derive two design principles to personalize the character of the CA and its therapeutic content. These principles are instantiated in prototypes and evaluated in interviews with experts experienced in delivering psychotherapy and potential nondiagnosed users. Personalization was perceived as crucial for treatment success, and autonomy and transparency emerged as important themes for personalization. We contribute by providing design principles for personalized CAs for mental health that extend previous CA research in the context of mental health.",10.1007/978-3-031-06516-3_3,4,Scopus,85131963583,2-s2.0-85131963583,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131963583

Machine Learning Based Psychotic Behaviors Prediction from Facebook Status Updates,Ali M.,2022,Computers Materials and Continua,"With the advent of technological advancements and the widespread Internet connectivity during the last couple of decades, social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) have consumed a large proportion of time in our daily lives. People tend to stay alive on their social media with recent updates, as it has become the primary source of interactionwithin social circles. Although social media platforms offer several remarkable features but are simultaneously prone to various critical vulnerabilities. Recent studies have revealed a strong correlation between the usage of social media and associated mental health issues consequently leading to depression, anxiety, suicide commitment, and mental disorder, particularly in the young adults who have excessively spent time on socialmedia which necessitates a thorough psychological analysis of all these platforms. This study aims to exploit machine learning techniques for the classification of psychotic issues based on Facebook status updates. In this paper, we start with depression detection in the first instance and then expand on analyzing six other psychotic issues (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychopathic deviate, hypochondria, unrealistic, and hypomania) commonly found in adults due to extreme use of social media networks. To classify the psychotic issues with the user's mental state, we have employed different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers i.e., Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The usedMLmodels are trained and tested by using different combinations of features selection techniques. To observe themost suitable classifiers for psychotic issue classification, a cost-benefit function (sometimes termed as 'Suitability') has been used which combines the accuracy of the model with its execution time. The experimental evidence argues that RF outperforms its competitor classifiers with the unigram feature set.",10.32604/cmc.2022.024704,7,Scopus,85127330433,2-s2.0-85127330433,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127330433
Hidradenitis Suppurativa International Online Community: Patient Characteristics and a Novel Model of Treatment Effectiveness,Barak-Levitt J.,2022,Acta Dermato Venereologica,"Treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa is diverse, yet frequently unsatisfactory. The aims of this study were to create a reproducible artificial intelligence-based patient-reported outcome platform for evaluation of the clinical characteristics and comorbidities of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, and to use this to grade treatment effectiveness. A retrospective patient-reported outcome study was conducted, based on online questionnaires completed by English-speaking patients registered to the hidradenitis suppurativa Stuff-ThatWorks® online community. Data collected included patient characteristics, comorbidities and treatment satisfaction. These were recoded into scalable labels using a combination of machine learning algorithm, manual coding and validation. A model of treatment effectiveness was generated. The cohort included 1,050 patients of mean ± standard deviation age 34.3 ± 10.3 years. Greater severity of hidradenitis suppurativa was associated with younger age at onset (p < 0.001) and male sex (p < 0.001). The most frequent comorbidities were depression (30%), anxiety (26.4%), and polycys-tic ovary syndrome (16.6%). Hurley stage I patients rated topical agents, dietary changes, turmeric, and pain relief measures more effective than tetracyclines. For Hurley stage II, adalimumab was rated most effec-tive. For Hurley stage III, adalimumab, other biologic agents, systemic steroids, and surgical treatment were rated more effective than tetracyclines. Patients with hidradenitis suppurativa often have comorbid psychia-tric and endocrine diseases.

Influence Analysis of the Screen Time on Daily Exercise Based on the Personal Activity Factor Model,Sekine Y.,2022,IEEE Region 10 Humanitarian Technology Conference R10 Htc,"The lockdown caused by the COVID-19 epidemic has led to using smartphones and decreasing physical activity in the world. It is known that increased screen time and decreased physical activity have bad effects on physical and mental health. However, few studies investigate the influence of screen time on the amount of exercise. By analyzing the influence, exercise promotion services can be improved. Therefore, in this study, we challenge to clarify the relationship between exercise and the screen time. Using a machine learning method, we verify the influence importance of screen time on the amount of exercise. We collect the data on smartphone screen time, tablet screen time, steps, and sleep score from a male college student. In addition, we gather weather of the location, and weekdays/weekends data during our experiment period. To analyze the influence, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is used. GBDT is a kind of decision tree-based method, and it can show the importance of explainable variables. As a result, the variables that were more important for exercise were, in order of importance, total screen time (total screen times of his smartphone and tablet), screen time of smartphone, and sleep score.

Depression and alcohol use in American Indian adolescents: The influence of family factors,Schick M.R.,2022,Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research,"Background: Rates of both depression and alcohol use are disproportionately higher among American Indian (AI) adolescents than adolescents in the general population. The co-occurrence of depression and alcohol use is common and clinically relevant given their reciprocal negative influences on outcomes. Family factors may be especially relevant because they could have a buffering effect on this relationship due to the importance of kinship and community in AI communities. The current study examines the roles of family warmth and parental monitoring in the association between depressive symptoms and alcohol use in a large, nationally representative sample of AI adolescents. Methods: Data were collected from 3498 AI 7th to 12th graders (47.8% female) residing on or near a reservation during the period 2009 to 2013. Participants reported on their depressive symptoms, family factors, and alcohol use. Results: There was a small, but statistically significant positive association between depressive symptoms and alcohol use (r = 0.11, p < 0.001). Greater depressive symptoms were associated with significantly less perceived family warmth (β = −0.09, 95% CI [−0.13, −0.06]), which was associated with significantly greater alcohol use (β = −0.39, 95% CI [−0.55, −0.23]). Family warmth significantly accounted for the association between depressive symptoms and alcohol use at high (β = 0.04, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [0.004, 0.09]), but not low, levels of parental monitoring (β = 0.02, SE = 0.02, 95% CI [−0.002, 0.06]). Conclusions: Results of the present study suggest that developing culturally sensitive prevention and treatment approaches focusing on increasing both family warmth and parental monitoring are important to address the co-occurrence of depression and alcohol misuse among AI adolescents.",10.1111/acer.14748,18,Scopus,85123480320,2-s2.0-85123480320,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123480320
"Association of screen time, quality of sleep and dry eye in college-going women of Northern India",Gupta P.,2022,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,"To evaluate the association of daily screen time and quality of sleep with the prevalence of dry eye among college-going women. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional, comparative questionnaire-based study of 547 college-going women in northern India. A 10-item Mini Sleep Questionnaire was used to check the quality of sleep, and the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) scale was used to examine the prevalence of dry eye among college-going women. Results: Multinomial logistic regression showed a significant association between dry eye with daily screen time spent (P < 0.05) and the quality of sleep (P < 0.05) among college-going girls. Using Latent Class Analysis, two latent classes were selected based on the Bayesian Information Criteria. It was found that the majority population falls in class two and was having Severe Sleep-Wake difficulty. It was seen that the participants in class two belonged to the age bracket of 18-21 years, were from stream Humanities, education of father and mother equal to graduation, father working only, belonging to the nuclear family, having one sibling, hailing from the urban locality, spending more than 6 h daily on-screen, a majority of them using mobile phones, not using eye lubricants, and reported an increase in screen time during COVID-19. Conclusion: Dry eye and sleep quality are essential global health issues, and coupled with increased screen time, may pose a challenge in the present era.

MRI-Based Radiomic Machine-Learning Model May Accurately Distinguish between Subjects with Internet Gaming Disorder and Healthy Controls,Han X.,2022,Brain Sciences,"Purpose To identify cerebral radiomic features related to the diagnosis of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and construct a radiomics-based machine-learning model for IGD diagnosis. Methods A total of 59 treatment-naïve subjects with IGD and 69 age-and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited and underwent anatomic and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The features of the morphometric properties of gray matter and diffusion properties of white matter were extracted for each participant. After excluding the noise feature with single-factor analysis of variance, the remaining 179 features were included in an all-relevant feature selection procedure within cross-validation loops to identify features with significant discriminative power. Random forest classifiers were constructed and evaluated based on the identified features. Results No overall differences in the total brain volume (1,555,295.64 ± 152,316.31 mm<sup>3</sup> vs. 154,491.19 ± 151,241.11 mm<sup>3</sup>), total gray (709,119.83 ± 59,534.46 mm<sup>3</sup> vs. 751,018.21 ± 58,611.32 mm<sup>3</sup>) and white (465,054.49 ± 51,862.65 mm<sup>3</sup> vs. 470,600.22 ± 47,006.67 mm<sup>3</sup>) matter volumes, and subcortical region volume (63,882.71 ± 5110.42 mm<sup>3</sup> vs. 64,764.36 ± 4332.33 mm<sup>3</sup>) between the IGD and HC groups were observed. The mean classification accuracy was 73%. An altered cortical shape in the bilateral fusiform, left rostral middle frontal (rMFG), left cuneus, left parsopercularis (IFG), and regions around the right uncinate fasciculus (UF) and left internal capsule (IC) contributed significantly to group discrimination.

A Systematic Survey on Computational agents for Mental Health Aid,Mansoori M.,2022,2022 IEEE 7th International Conference for Convergence in Technology I2ct 2022,"In recent times the rate of mental health disorders among the youth has spiked due to increased competitiveness which affects the mental well-being of students. An unhealthy mental state not only affects the daily life of an individual but is also the reason for increased self-harm and suicide rates. In developing nations, the ratio of mental care professionals to mental health patients is far too less for all to receive care. A solution to this problem is internet-delivered cognitive therapy (iCBT). The objective of this paper is to shed light on various techniques that can deliver iCBT to a patient in a comfortable manner. Since iCBT can be delivered from home, it tackles the challenge of societal stigma. Different existing approaches and solutions being implemented like various types of chatbots(SERMO, EMMA) and social robots(Ryan Bot)are analyzed and compared in this paper.

A Machine Learning Based Approach to Predict Online Gaming Addiction in the Context of Bangladesh,Islam S.,2022,2022 13th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies Icccnt 2022,"Online games are hazardous to one's health and well-being. Addiction to video games has now become a concern to Bangladeshi youth. Our lives are negatively impacted by online gaming. We must keep an eye on our country's youth to ensure that they do not become addicted to any kind of internet gaming. We must refrain from playing games in order to avoid being hooked on them. Machine learning will be used to forecast the likelihood of becoming addicted to video games. We begin by reviewing relevant studies, journals, and internet publications, and then we speak with online gaming addictions. We discovered certain common elements that are linked to gaming addiction and Lemmen's gaming addiction scale to measure the whether a person is addicted or not. Then, based on those criteria, such as age, gender, mental pressure, and so on, we collect data. We gather information from both addicts and nonaddicts. There are two possible outcomes: We processed all of the data once it was collected and developed a processed dataset. On our processed dataset, we used machine learning techniques. In different predictions and detection systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning are applied. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), LR (Logistic Regression), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (ADA Boosting), Decision Tree (DT), XGBOOST and Gradient Boosting (GB) classifier are some of the methods we utilize. Adaptive Boosting outperformed the other nine methods in our study. All the nine classifiers predict with high accuracy and among them, Adaptive Boosting (ADA Boosting) gives the maximum accuracy which is 93.00%.",10.1109/ICCCNT54827.2022.9984508,7,Scopus,85146335984,2-s2.0-85146335984,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146335984
Anxiety and Depression Detection using Machine Learning,Aggarwal R.,2022,2022 International Conference on Machine Learning Big Data Cloud and Parallel Computing Com IT Con 2022,"Anxiety and Depression are among the extremely crucial mental health issues. Every year, millions of individuals suffer from depression and anxiety, yet only a small percentage of them receive timely treatment. Throughout the last few decades, the evolution of machine learning methods has considerably aided in the development of technologies that assist clinicians in predicting various sorts of mental illnesses. As the Covid-19 pandemic rapidly spreads over the world, the global gaming industry is booming. Youth is increasingly focused on digital games due to lockdown and social distancing policies. This work presents a system for predicting if a player suffers from psychological illnesses such as anxiety and depression by combining game and player information with a selfesteem measure. The game and player's data has been gathered from two questionnaires namely, GAD and SWL, and multiple state-of-the-art simulations have been conducted. Four different machine learning classifiers were tested using 10-fold cross-validation approach on data set of internet gamers. Among the four algorithms, Decision Tree classifier showed the best accuracy for all predicted parameters.

Emotional Robotics: Curse or Blessing in Psychiatric Care?,Al-Ameery-brosche I.,2022,Intelligence Theories and Applications,"The development of artificial social–emotional intelligence is being intensively researched and financially supported. Socially and emotionally intelligent robots are still “science fiction,” but assistive robots in social areas such as nursing and artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning are already being used in psychiatry. What implications does this have for child and adolescent psychiatry? The benefits of the sporadically used “social” robots in child and adolescent psychiatry should be intensively examined and critically questioned from a content-related, ethical, and political perspective. Machine learning for the development of mental health apps and therapeutic chatbots is in use worldwide, and it is hard to imagine the digital field of “mental health” care without it. Here, artificial intelligence can be helpful and supportive in reaching out to those in need of help who would otherwise not be able to access mental health care. It can process massive amounts of data in the form of screenings to identify people at risk and enable support from the helpline system. For such use, the mental health community should be deeply involved to develop qualitative, ethical, and legal standards.

In particular, we highlight how promising (and less promising) potential areas of application can be identified and discuss some of the general challenges of applying machine learning methods. We provide illustrative examples where they exist. We draw, where possible, from mental health services, and especially those that serve children and adolescents or have implications for common developmental or early-onset disorders. Machine learning has the potential to enhance CAMHS and particularly the effectiveness and reach of psychological therapies.

Deep learning for prediction of depressive symptoms in a large textual dataset,Uddin M.Z.,2022,Neural Computing and Applications,"Depression is a common illness worldwide with potentially severe implications. Early identification of depressive symptoms is a crucial first step towards assessment, intervention, and relapse prevention. With an increase in data sets with relevance for depression, and the advancement of machine learning, there is a potential to develop intelligent systems to detect symptoms of depression in written material. This work proposes an efficient approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to identify texts describing self-perceived symptoms of depression. The approach is applied on a large dataset from a public online information channel for young people in Norway. The dataset consists of youth’s own text-based questions on this information channel. Features are then provided from a one-hot process on robust features extracted from the reflection of possible symptoms of depression pre-defined by medical and psychological experts. The features are better than conventional approaches, which are mostly based on the word frequencies (i.e., some topmost frequent words are chosen as features from the whole text dataset and applied to model the underlying events in any text message) rather than symptoms. Then, a deep learning approach is applied (i.e., RNN) to train the time-sequential features discriminating texts describing depression symptoms from posts with no such descriptions (non-depression posts). Finally, the trained RNN is used to automatically predict depression posts. The system is compared against conventional approaches where it achieved superior performance than others. The linear discriminant space clearly reveals the robustness of the features by generating better clustering than other traditional features. Besides, since the features are based on the possible symptoms of depression, the system may generate meaningful explanations of the decision from machine learning models using an explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The proposed depression symptom feature-based approach shows superior performance compared to the traditional general word frequency-based approaches where frequency of the features gets more importance than the specific symptoms of depression. Although the proposed approach is applied on a Norwegian dataset, a similar robust approach can be applied on other depression datasets developed in other languages with proper annotations and symptom-based feature extraction. Thus, the depression prediction approach can be adopted to contribute to develop better mental health care technologies such as intelligent chatbots.",10.1007/s00521-021-06426-4,139,Scopus,85113630004,2-s2.0-85113630004,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113630004
Which Adolescents Are Well-Suited to App-Based Mindfulness Training? A Randomized Clinical Trial and Data-Driven Approach for Personalized Recommendations,Webb C.A.,2022,Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,"Objective: Rumination heightens risk for depression and anxiety, which increase substantially during adolescence. Smartphone apps offer a convenient and cost-effective means for adolescents to access mindfulness training, which may reduce rumination. Despite their increasing popularity, it is unclear which adolescents benefit from mindfulness apps. Method: Adolescents (n = 152) with elevated trait rumination were randomly assigned to 3 weeks of app-based mindfulness training or a mood-monitoring control. Multilevel models tested group differences in state rumination change, assessed via ecological momentary assessment. Baseline adolescent characteristics were submitted to elastic net regularization models to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” indicating an individual’s expected outcome from the mindfulness app relative to the mood-monitoring control. Finally, we translated a predictive model (developed in an external sample) for personalized recommendations of expected benefit from the mindfulness app. Results: Adolescents in the mindfulness app condition reported significantly greater reductions in rumination than adolescents in the control condition. Individuals predicted to have better outcomes from the mindfulness app relative to mood monitoring had significantly greater reductions in rumination if randomly assigned to the mindfulness condition. In contrast, between-condition differences in outcome were not significant for adolescents predicted to have better outcomes in the mood-monitoring condition. Conclusions: Findings support the efficacy of a mindfulness app to reduce state rumination in adolescents, particularly among adolescents high in trait rumination. A predictive model is put forth, which could be used to objectively communicate expected mindfulness app outcomes to adolescents prior to engagement in app-based mindfulness training.",10.1037/ccp0000763,21,Scopus,85140658997,2-s2.0-85140658997,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140658997

An Automated Stress Recognition for Digital Healthcare: Towards E-Governance,Phukan O.C.,2022,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"Mental health is of utmost importance in present times as mental health problems can have a negative impact on an individual. Stress recognition is an important part of the digital healthcare system as stress may act as a catalyst and lead to mental health problems or further amplify them. With the advancement of technology, the presence of smart wearable devices is seen and it can be used to automate stress recognition for digital healthcare. These smart wearable devices have physiological sensors embedded into them. The data collected from these physiological sensors have paved an efficient way for stress recognition in the user. Most of the previous work related to stress recognition was done using classical machine learning approaches. One of the major drawbacks related to these approaches is that they require manually extracting important features that will be helpful in stress recognition. Extracting these features requires human domain expertise. Another drawback of previous works was that it only caters to specific groups of individuals such as stress among youths, stress due to the workplace, etc. and fails to generalize. To overcome the issues related to previous works done, this study proposes a transformer-based deep learning approach for automating the feature extraction phase and classifying a user’s state into three classes baseline, stress, and amusement.",10.1007/978-3-031-22950-3_10,5,Scopus,85147715871,2-s2.0-85147715871,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147715871
An optimized deep learning approach for suicide detection through Arabic tweets,Baghdadi N.A.,2022,Peerj Computer Science,"Many people worldwide suffer from mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder (MDD), which affect their thoughts, behavior, and quality of life. Suicide is regarded as the second leading cause of death among teenagers when treatment is not received. Twitter is a platform for expressing their emotions and thoughts about many subjects. Many studies, including this one, suggest using social media data to track depression and other mental illnesses. Even though Arabic is widely spoken and has a complex syntax, depressive detection methods have not been applied to the language. The Arabic tweets dataset should be scraped and annotated first. Then, a complete framework for categorizing tweet inputs into two classes (such as Normal or Suicide) is suggested in this study. The article also proposes an Arabic tweet preprocessing algorithm that contrasts lemmatization, stemming, and various lexical analysis methods. Experiments are conducted using Twitter data scraped from the Internet. Five different annotators have annotated the data. Performance metrics are reported on the suggested dataset using the latest Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) models. The measured performance metrics are balanced accuracy, specificity, F1-score, IoU, ROC, Youden Index, NPV, and weighted sum metric (WSM). Regarding USE models, the best-weighted sum metric (WSM) is 80.2%, and with regards to Arabic BERT models, the best WSM is 95.26%.",10.7717/PEERJ-CS.1070,29,Scopus,85138116440,2-s2.0-85138116440,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138116440
Investigating User Information and Social Media Features in Cyberbullying Detection,Qiu J.,2022,Proceedings 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data Big Data 2022,"As society grows increasingly more online with each passing year, the problem of cyberbullying becomes more and more prominent, with such incidents having the capacity to negatively impact mental health in a major way, especially among children and teenagers. The proposed approach builds on our previous work that established multi-modal detection of cyberbullying on Twitter, and restructures the multi-modal approach by incorporating social media features such as time-related features and social network information. As a result, the new models reach a classification accuracy between 94.4% and 94.6%, from the previous accuracy of 93%. The proposed new approach affirms the use of context-based data in addition to more directly-related features when analyzing cyberbullying and other interactions with promising improvements. We believe that this work contributes significantly to the study of cyberbullying detection, which is an imminent problem with growing importance in the post-COVID society.",10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020305,3,Scopus,85147944507,2-s2.0-85147944507,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147944507
A machine learning-based depression detection on social media platforms for adolescents: A work in progress narrative review,Vahdati F.,2022,Proceedings of IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering Csde 2022,"A rise in depression episodes has prompted an increased focus on depression detection. This research paper aims to review the literature to discover the pros and cons of proposed solutions for this critical social problem. In this narrative review, specifically, we looked at machine learning (ML) based techniques that analyse text data from social media to diagnose depression symptoms. A thorough search technique across several databases for relevant articles, specifically Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, ERIC, PsycINFO, and BioMed databases, were used to perform a narrative evaluation. Terms and definitions were used to filter the article titles, abstracts, and full texts.

PRODEP: Smart Social Media Procrastination and Depression Tracker,Kulatilake T.T.,2022,2022 17th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization Smap 2022,"Procrastination refers to the voluntary delay of urgent tasks and can have several negative consequences such as stress, health issues and academic underachievement [47]. It is viewed within physiological research as a self-regulation failure [48]. Similar to procrastination, another severe problem which comes up within lots of people including students and teenagers is ""Depression"". Depression is a massively widespread problem among people around the world as well as in Sri Lanka [49]. As a result of procrastination and depression, students has to face academic underachievement. One of the main cause of these widespread problems are Social media over-usage [50]. Therefore this paper presents a new tracker which presented as a mobile application with four main components. This research study is about identifying and tracking users' facial emotions and eye-aspect ratio to analyze real emotions of the user via device inbuilt webcam to identify user fatigueness and procrastination. This study also analyzes user behavior in two selected social media platforms which are Facebook and Twitter and identifies the negativity and depressiveness of ""Sinhala""content using Machine learning based Sentiment analysis approaches. Also as a companion, this paper introduces a chat-bot which communicates with the user in ""Singlish""language.

Adolescent Behavioral Risk Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Foundation for Precision Suicide Prevention,Zheng Y.,2022,Proceedings of SPIE the International Society for Optical Engineering,"Suicidal ideation, attempts, and deaths among adolescents are a major and growing health concern. In 2019, suicide accounted for 11% of adolescent deaths in the U.S. (second-leading cause of death among U.S. teenagers). Accurately predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among adolescents remains challenging. This study aimed to identify the most accurate prediction models for adolescent STBs using machine learning (ML) methods. The predictors were selected by expert-informed and parametric models. The study used the data from Mississippi Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). The data were collected from Mississippi public high school students between 2001 and 2019 (inclusive). A broad array of features (survey question responses) were available to train the models including depression, drug use, bullying, violence, online habits, diet, and sports participation. We applied support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and neural network algorithms to the YRBSS data. Suicide ideation (consideration) or suicide attempt are used as the outcome variables. Data-derived ML models performed well in predictive accuracy. These results are compared with three ML algorithms versus three different methods of predictor variable selection. The highest accuracy was achieved with expert-informed models. The accuracy of predicting suicide ideation was slightly higher than the accuracy of suicide attempt. The difference between ML algorithms was insignificant. These prediction models of suicide ideation and attempt may help Mississippi public high schools educators, parents, and policy makers, better target risk behaviors and hence effectively prevent adolescent suicide in Mississippi.",10.1117/12.2620105,2,Scopus,85135913173,2-s2.0-85135913173,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135913173
Strengthening Public Institutions and Social Inclusion of Vulnerable Groups in A Developing Country - Innovation in Organizations and Artificial Intelligence Implications,Mallah Boustani N.,2022,Pacific Asia Journal of the Association for Information Systems,"Background: In the context of a developing nation, children's participation in communal life is almost non-existent. The goal of the study is to contribute to national policies for local development that should prioritize the safety and well-being of the most vulnerable populations, particularly children under the age of 18. Innovating, including children in decision-making and maintaining local services in three pilot municipalities in order to prevent and combat all forms of exploitation to which they are exposed. How can Youth engagement in social and political community life be improved through better understanding of their needs and interests, and what are the artificial intelligence implications? Method: The methodology was used and designed to re-validate an existing program using pre-defined components of an agreement between the Italian and Lebanese governments. A needs study on the socio-demographic profile of youth and a situational analysis was conducted answering three objectives in the program of the Child Friendly City initiative. Results: Assuring the long-term viability and social inclusion of a significant sociodemographic group was successfully implemented: A free call center, software applications, a library, a digital network center, and the involvement of children on the municipal board of directors were established. The findings need to be adapted to various locations using artificial intelligence (AI) solutions and strategies for social awareness and behavior analysis. Conclusion: The importance of this study was underscored during the Covid-19 sanitary crisis, when some of these technologies enabled young people in impacted areas to integrate and become aware of the pandemic's risk. The case was based on theories such as Gender Inequalities and Children's Inclusion, Municipal Governance & Reform, Organizational Innovation (Public Sector), and Social Inclusion, and it demonstrates the value of innovating in the public sector and protecting vulnerable populations through the use of AI.",10.17705/1pais.14304,2,Scopus,85131356607,2-s2.0-85131356607,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131356607
Yoga Recommendation System for the Mental Well-Being of Students using Machine Learning,Ramamoorthy S.,2022,6th International Conference on Electronics Communication and Aerospace Technology Iceca 2022 Proceedings,"Many expectations placed on students by society have made stress a part of their academic lives. Youth are susceptible to the issues brought on by academic stress since they are going through a phase of transitions in both aspects i.e personal and social. Academic stress has been shown to lower academic achievement and lower motivation toward academics. Therefore, it becomes crucial to develop appropriate and effective intervention options. In recent times, due to COVID, the utilization of online health blogs and sites recommending health, exercise, and yoga has been significantly increased. The blog will provide solution to a problem and then provide precautions to common people but they lack the dynamics to suggest yoga that can be done any person or a personalized yoga by considering their health condition and not a static article. This research work intends to develop an AI model to predict the possible practices a student can do to alleviate their problem by considering their BPM, blood pressure (both systole and diastole), sleep time and some questions related to stress. The proposed stress prediction model has achieved an accuracy of 94.4% and the yoga pose recommendation system has achieved an accuracy of 97.3%.",10.1109/ICECA55336.2022.10009557,9,Scopus,85147533114,2-s2.0-85147533114,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147533114
Engagement With a Mobile Phone–Based Life Skills Intervention for Adolescents and Its Association With Participant Characteristics and Outcomes: Tree-Based Analysis,Castro R.P.,2022,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Mobile phone–delivered life skills programs are an emerging and promising way to promote mental health and prevent substance use among adolescents, but little is known about how adolescents actually use them. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine engagement with a mobile phone–based life skills program and its different components, as well as the associations of engagement with adolescent characteristics and intended substance use and mental health outcomes. Methods: We performed secondary data analysis on data from the intervention group (n=750) from a study that compared a mobile phone–based life skills intervention for adolescents recruited in secondary and upper secondary school classes with an assessment-only control group. Throughout the 6-month intervention, participants received 1 SMS text message prompt per week that introduced a life skills topic or encouraged participation in a quiz or individual life skills training or stimulated sharing messages with other program participants through a friendly contest. Decision trees were used to identify predictors of engagement (use and subjective experience). The stability of these decision trees was assessed using a resampling method and by graphical representation. Finally, associations between engagement and intended substance use and mental health outcomes were examined using logistic and linear regression analyses. Results: The adolescents took part in half of the 50 interactions (mean 23.6, SD 15.9) prompted by the program, with SMS text messages being the most used and contests being the least used components. Adolescents who did not drink in a problematic manner and attended an upper secondary school were the ones to use the program the most. Regarding associations between engagement and intended outcomes, adolescents who used the contests more frequently were more likely to be nonsmokers at follow-up than those who did not (odds ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.98; P=.02). In addition, adolescents who read the SMS text messages more attentively were less likely to drink in a problematic manner at follow-up (odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 1.29-3.41; P=.003). Finally, participants who used the program the most and least were more likely to increase their well-being from baseline to 6-month follow-up compared with those with average engagement (βs=.39; t<inf>586</inf>=2.66; P=.008; R<sup>2</sup>=0.24). Conclusions: Most of the adolescents participating in a digital life skills program that aimed to prevent substance use and promote mental health engaged with the intervention. However, measures to increase engagement in problem drinkers should be considered. Furthermore, efforts must be made to ensure that interventions are engaging and powerful across different educational levels. First results indicate that higher engagement with digital life skills programs could be associated with intended outcomes. Future studies should apply further measures to improve the reach of lower-engaged participants at follow-up to establish such associations with certainty.",10.2196/28638,11,Scopus,85123536317,2-s2.0-85123536317,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123536317
Uncoupling Inequality: Reflections on the Ethics of Benchmarks for Digital Media,Washington A.L.,2022,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,"Our collaboration seeks to demonstrate shared interrogation by exploring the ethics of machine learning benchmarks from a socio-technical management perspective with insight from public health and ethnic studies. Benchmarks, such as ImageNet, are annotated open data sets for training algorithms. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the practical need for ethical information infrastructures to analyze digital and social media, especially related to medicine and race. Social media analysis that obscures Black teen mental health and ignores anti-Asian hate fails as information infrastructure. Despite inadequately handling non-dominant voices, machine learning benchmarks are the basis for analysis in operational systems. Turning to the management literature, we interrogate cross-cutting problems of benchmarks through the lens of coupling, or mutual interdependence between people, technologies, and environments. Uncoupling inequality from machine learning benchmarks may require conceptualizing the social dependencies that build structural barriers to inclusion.",,1,Scopus,85152227570,2-s2.0-85152227570,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152227570

Cyberbullying in Online/E-Learning Platforms Based on Social Networks,Balaji N.,2022,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"Cyberbullying is a method of harassment using electronic means and is very common among all, as the digital sphere has extended its technology. As school districts shut down in retort to COVID-19 and students are moving to E-learning, ever than before our children may be using most of the period in front of screens. Though the digital world is supporting us link and study more, it is also a situation where harmful behavior can be encountered. It is serious that we engross our children in dialogue to keep them protective and motivate them to be very vigilant with what they share online. To better safeguard your child, we wish you to study more about digital awareness, check your child’s screen time and online activities, comprehend and set settings related to privacy, and set rules with your child. Bullying is spiteful behavior that is aggressive, unwanted, and repeated. This can be verbal, social, physical, or online. They are acts of power and can directly cause guilt, sadness, shame, and anger. Bullying is not restricted to children; adults can also bully other adults or children. Cyberbullying is victimization that happens online and over digital devices. Cyberbullying examples comprise detestable or mean texts, social media posts envisioned to embarrassing or fake images, spread rumors, sexually explicit, or threatening direct messages. It is significant to take cyberbullying and bullying of any kind, seriously. Bullying can have a long-lasting effect on a child’s mental health, relationships, and confidence. It can distress their capability to focus on academics and extracurricular happenings. And, it can also cause a child to make to bullying others, as a technique to get control back and feel like they have power again. In social media where bigger communication opportunities are offered, they even enhance the defenselessness for many people in the form of threatening online with the messages, images, and so on. In recent studies, cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters, teenagers, and school students. To avoid such situation, an intelligent system is required for the identification of these threats automatically. The chapter mainly focuses on the types of cyberbullying, followed by case studies in which we discuss about the automatic detection of cyberbullying in online learning/E-learning platform based on social network.",10.1007/978-981-16-6369-7_20,3,Scopus,85122077242,2-s2.0-85122077242,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122077242
Arabic Cyberbullying Detection from Imbalanced Dataset Using Machine Learning,AlFarah M.E.,2022,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"In recent years, the number of online social networks users is dramatically increased. Cyberbullying is a serious threat in online social networks especially toward children and teenagers. Victims are harassed by perpetrators even with no physical attendance. Cyberbullying causes psychological damage to victims resulting in anxiety, depression, and even suicide. Cyberbullying is language and culture sensitive. Many prior works in cyberbullying detection was conducted in English and only few papers studied Arabic cyberbullying detection. In this research, Arabic cyberbullying detection using five machine learning techniques were studied using real Arabic messages from Twitter and YouTube. Many performance techniques were used to evaluate the robustness of the model.

Sentiment Analysis of Depression Illness during Covid-19 in Social Media: A Preliminary Study,Nazir N.I.,2022,2022 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences Championing Innovations in Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences for Sustainable Future Aidas 2022 Proceedings,"Depression is now a common mental health condition that must be treated in people, particularly adolescents. Although the issue of mental illness has received more attention in recent years, many cases of depression remain undiagnosed. Traditionally, the diagnosis process involved face-to-face communication between doctors and patients, with the doctors referring to clinical depression criteria. However, there are few and limited resources and facilities for the early detection and treatment of depression and other mental illnesses. Therefore, to reduce the negative effect on public health, it is important to provide a model to classify depression by using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis has recently emerged as a hot topic in classifying the opinions expressed in a piece of writing to determine the information insight and the writer's point of view on a specific issue. This paper investigates the method to classify sentiments in the mental health domain. The classical features and sentiment analysis approach is conducted in this preliminary study to detect depression using a sample of data collected from Twitter. By using a combination of the lexical approach and the Naive Bayes model, the highest accuracy is achieved above 69%. The results indicate a combination of lexical and machine learning outperforms several machine learning approaches for classifying depression in individual tweets.",10.1109/AiDAS56890.2022.9918805,2,Scopus,85141801925,2-s2.0-85141801925,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141801925
Clinical applications of big data to child and adolescent mental health care,Wickersham A.,2022,Shaping the Future of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Towards Technological Advances and Service Innovations,"Over the past twodecades, healthcare providers across the world have adopted digital methods for capturing clinical and administrative information. Clinicians take contemporaneous records of their interactions with patients, so many health service providers have accrued vast repositories of longitudinally collected data. These data, coupled with advances in data extraction methods, computer processing power, and linkage to nonhealth public services data, now provide child and adolescent mental health researchers unique opportunities for tackling a broad range of clinical questions; especially those where the considerations of scale and generalizability make individually funded studies unaffordable. However, these “big” data have their limitations. Best practice requires clinicians, informaticians, and data scientists to work together, so assumptions over data quality or validity are not misplaced. This chapter explains why the evidence base for child and adolescent mental healthcare needs big data applications as well as conventional research, to move the field forward. This chapter provides illustrations of big data applications to child and adolescent mental healthcare, primarily from England and the United Kingdom, but also offers a section on the global perspective. This chapter also reviews the methodological strengths and weaknesses of big data and describes the ethical and governance implications for their use.",10.1016/B978-0-323-91709-4.00005-6,2,Scopus,85142777622,2-s2.0-85142777622,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142777622
Empirical Investigation for Predicting Depression from Different Machine Learning Based Voice Recognition Techniques,Punithavathi R.,2022,Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine,"Over the past few decades, the rate of diagnosing depression and mental illness among youths in both genders has been emerging as a challenging issue in the present society. Adequate numbers of cases that have been prevailing had unheard of symptoms linked to mental depression that are able to be detected using their voice recordings and their messages in social media websites. Due to the wide spread usage of mobile phones, services and social sites emotion prediction and analyzing have been an indispensable part of providing vital care for the eminence of youth's life. In addition to dynamicity and popularity of mobile applications and services, it is really a challenge to provide an emotion prediction system that can collect, analyze, and process emotional communications in real time and as well as in a highly accurate manner with minimal computation time. Few depression prediction researchers have analyzed and examined that various social networking sites and its activities may be merged to low self-confidence, particularly in young people and adolescents. Moreover, the researchers suggest that several objective voice acoustic measures affected by depression can be detected reliably over the smart phones. And also in some observational study, it is stated that speech samples of patients from the telephone were obtained each week using an IVR system, and voice recording files from smart phones have been under process for predicting the depression. Such that several telephonic standards for obtaining voice data were identified as a crucial factor influencing the reliability and eminence of speech data. Hence, this article investigates on different process applied in different machine learning algorithms in recognizing voice signals which in turn will be used for scrutinizing the techniques for detecting depression levels in future. This will make a blooming change in the youth's life and solve the social unethical issues in hand.",10.1155/2022/6395860,10,Scopus,85128695772,2-s2.0-85128695772,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128695772
Evaluation of Internet Addiction Exercise Intervention Effect for Teenagers Based on Intelligent Psychological Strategy Technology,Li J.,2022,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,"Modern information has led to Internet addiction among some young people. Some studies have shown that Internet addiction has serious harm to young people, such as affecting young people's learning and endangering young people's physical health. Even more serious, it may lead to depression, suicide, and other problem appearance. At present, most of the research on Internet addiction focuses on the development of questionnaires, symptoms, and causes of Internet addiction, and there is still a lack of treatment and intervention. Therefore, in the era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, let artificial intelligence use psychological strategies. Technology to intervene adolescents' Internet addiction is a new technology required by current intelligent psychological terminal equipment, and this technology is still in the field of data preprocessing and classification. For the intelligent psychological strategy technology that is applied and located in the terminal device, the ability to intelligently identify whether the Internet addiction is an inevitable trend of the development of modern intelligent devices. Looking back at this technology, we can often see two prominent problems with this technology during the development process, namely, accuracy and efficiency. Due to the development of 5G technology and cloud computing, the intelligent identification process can be transferred to the cloud for rapid completion, and the terminal device only needs to receive feedback to solve the efficiency problem as much as possible. The problem of relative accuracy is the difficulty that the current intelligent psychological strategy technology needs to overcome, and it is also the focus of this article. This paper introduces the related technologies in the process of intelligent psychological technology intervention, the extraction of Internet addiction problems, and the use of related technologies to intervene and explore the improvement under the current mainstream algorithm conditions. Intelligent technology improves the accuracy of psychological intervention. Through the discussion of the actual comparison experiment of the algorithm, we can understand that the influencing factors of the accuracy rate are mainly concentrated in the influence of the Internet, such as unreasonable game play and video browsing. We are committed to ensuring that the intelligent psychological strategy technology of terminal equipment can accurately intervene the Internet addiction problem of young people without changing the equipment conditions. First of all, the optimized algorithm is easier to understand and less difficult to use than ordinary algorithms, which greatly reduces the difficulty for psychoanalysts or intervention evaluators to deal with problems. Secondly, the intelligent psychological strategy technology is the product of many experiments and is gradually widely recognized and accepted by everyone. It can carry out statistics, calculation, and visual display through various data of intelligent programs and realizes automatic intervention for multiple problems, which can significantly reduce the user's time and cost investment, reduce the burden of staff, and provide analysts and evaluators with substantial information help.",10.1155/2022/7029855,0,Scopus,85138853099,2-s2.0-85138853099,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138853099
Wearable device for determining and preempting the emotional dysregulation of ADHD adolescents,Tim P.L.,2022,IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference Proceedings TENCON,"Anger is one of our core natural emotions. It is a crucial part of the survival of the human species as it assists us to conquer fears and can trigger the fight or flight response when we encounter threats and dangerous situations. However, the dysregulation of anger control can lead to different health and psychological problems for individuals. This is especially true for adolescents who were diagnosed with Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous research has shown that emotion dysregulation is one of the main reasons young people with ADHD have difficulty socially leading to a higher risk of anxiety, depression, and substance abuse especially as adolescents. Current and past research suggests that behaviour conditioning and medication are two possible ways that destructive and unwarranted symptoms of ADHD may be reduced. Effective conditioning involves first sensing an ADHD individual is moving towards an unstable anger trigger point, and then mitigating the cause or distracting the individual to prevent further aggravation. Specific changes of certain vital signs, during the mood change, can be detected as the individual moves towards a trigger point. These include changes in the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), pulse rate (PR) and skin temperature (ST). These mentioned vital signs can be used as indicators of changes in mood or stress. This research considers the above three factors and combines the necessary sensors into one wearable device for an ADHD individual to wear.

Men’s preferences for therapist gender: Predictors and impact on satisfaction with therapy,Seidler Z.E.,2022,Counselling Psychology Quarterly,"Little empirical data exists regarding men’s preferences for therapist gender, including what predicts these preferences, and the impact they may have on satisfaction with care. To address this, data were drawn from an online survey of Australian men (n = 2002; aged 16–85; M = 43.8 years) reflecting on their preferences for and experiences of mental health treatment. Participants responded to items assessing demographics alongside their preference for therapist gender, reason for this preference and items on masculinity and treatment satisfaction, which were entered into a predictive model. Findings indicated that the majority (60.5%) of respondents did not indicate a preference, while equal proportions preferred male (19.1%) and female therapists (20.4%). Undergraduate-educated, non-heterosexual, and more masculine-identifying men were all more likely to prefer a male therapist. Severely depressed men preferred a female therapist. Finally, seeing a therapist who matched one’s gender preference was a significant predictor of satisfaction with therapy, while feeling less manly in attending therapy mediated this relationship. While the majority of men reported no gender preference for their therapist, for those who do, the underpinnings and implications warrant consideration and discussion. Limitations and clinical and research implications are discussed.",10.1080/09515070.2021.1940866,12,Scopus,85109854849,2-s2.0-85109854849,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109854849

"PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICTORS AND ""PROTECTORS"" OF STUDENTS' INTERNET ADDICTION",Kolmogortseva A.A.,2022,Obrazovanie I Nauka,"Introduction. Currently, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the educational environment is forced to ""migrate"" to a virtual environment, which significantly increases the duration of student youth on the Internet space. In this regard, it has become even more relevant to consider psychological characteristics, which allow a person to remain within the framework of a ""healthy"" use of the Internet, and, which ones predict the emergence of Internet addiction. The aim of the present research was to identify the psychological properties of a person that contribute to and prevent the emergence of Internet addiction among students in the higher education system. Methodology and research methods. The methodological foundations of the study are the following: the theory of G. Allport, who considers the personality as an open self-developing system; the psychological concept of viability of E. A. Rylskaya; the theory of reflection by A. V. Karpov; a set of reasonable ideas about Internet addiction by A. Yu. Egorov, A. E. Voiskunsky, et al. The methodological foundations made it possible to present the predictors of Internet addiction as factors contributing to the ""closure"" of the system and inhibiting the personality development, and ""protectors"" as those psychological variables that protect the individual from the occurrence of Internet addiction, ensuring its openness and freedom of humanbecoming. The sample of the study was 201 people: students of South Ural State University aged 18 to 24 years (X = 21.14; SD = 1.52): 94 women (46.8 %) and 107 men (53.2 %). In the course of the empirical research, a complex of psychodiagnostic methods was used: ""Chen Internet Addiction Scale"" as adapted by K. A. Feklisov and V. L. Malygin; the Cattell's Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (form C); the reflexivity questionnaire by A. V. Karpov and the questionnaire ""Human vitality"" by E. A. Rylskaya. The following methods of mathematical statistics were used: descriptive statistics, discriminant analysis. Calculations were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 17.0. Results. The psychological characteristics of the personality, which act as predictors and ""protectors"" of Internet addiction, are revealed. The predictors of Internet addiction in students include: emotional instability, low normative behaviour, anxiety, tension, low self-control, indicating the tendency of a person addicted to the Internet to be highly conflicted and irritable, reactive arousal and impulsiveness. Such students are characterised by immaturity of emotions, instability of interests, irresponsibility; dependent on mood, poorly control the manifestation of emotions and their own behaviour; have a weak will. Internet addiction hinders personal development. At the same time, reflexivity and vitality act as ""protectors"" and perform a protective function in the emergence of Internet addiction, allowing the individual to remain an open self-developing system. Scientific novelty. For the first time, a comprehensive study of predictors and ""protectors"" of Internet addiction was performed on a sample of students in the context of the idea of a personality as an open self-developing system, which made it possible to present Internet addiction as a phenomenon that negatively affects the personality development. A prognostic model has been empirically verified, which includes a set of psychological variables that ""predict"" the emergence of Internet addiction in students with a greater or lesser degree of probability. Practical significance. The Internet addiction ""prediction"" modelling can be applied in counselling practice, when clients are not aware of their addiction or are trying to hide it. The research materials and the conclusions made by the authors can serve as a basis for developing recommendations for the prevention of Internet addiction, and the identified ""protectors"" (viability and reflexivity) determine the direction of development of correctional and training programmes.",10.17853/1994-5639-2022-5-122-146,0,Scopus,85132822208,2-s2.0-85132822208,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132822208
Acoustic and Facial Features from Clinical Interviews for Machine Learning-Based Psychiatric Diagnosis: Algorithm Development,Birnbaum M.L.,2022,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: In contrast to all other areas of medicine, psychiatry is still nearly entirely reliant on subjective assessments such as patient self-report and clinical observation. The lack of objective information on which to base clinical decisions can contribute to reduced quality of care. Behavioral health clinicians need objective and reliable patient data to support effective targeted interventions. Objective: We aimed to investigate whether reliable inferences-psychiatric signs, symptoms, and diagnoses-can be extracted from audiovisual patterns in recorded evaluation interviews of participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder. Methods: We obtained audiovisual data from 89 participants (mean age 25.3 years; male: 48/89, 53.9%; female: 41/89, 46.1%): individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (n=41), individuals with bipolar disorder (n=21), and healthy volunteers (n=27). We developed machine learning models based on acoustic and facial movement features extracted from participant interviews to predict diagnoses and detect clinician-coded neuropsychiatric symptoms, and we assessed model performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in 5-fold cross-validation. Results: The model successfully differentiated between schizophrenia spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder (AUROC 0.73) when aggregating face and voice features. Facial action units including cheek-raising muscle (AUROC 0.64) and chin-raising muscle (AUROC 0.74) provided the strongest signal for men. Vocal features, such as energy in the frequency band 1 to 4 kHz (AUROC 0.80) and spectral harmonicity (AUROC 0.78), provided the strongest signal for women. Lip corner-pulling muscle signal discriminated between diagnoses for both men (AUROC 0.61) and women (AUROC 0.62). Several psychiatric signs and symptoms were successfully inferred: blunted affect (AUROC 0.81), avolition (AUROC 0.72), lack of vocal inflection (AUROC 0.71), asociality (AUROC 0.63), and worthlessness (AUROC 0.61). Conclusions: This study represents advancement in efforts to capitalize on digital data to improve diagnostic assessment and supports the development of a new generation of innovative clinical tools by employing acoustic and facial data analysis.",10.2196/24699,24,Scopus,85124133911,2-s2.0-85124133911,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124133911
Using natural language processing to extract self-harm and suicidality data from a clinical sample of patients with eating disorders: A retrospective cohort study,Cliffe C.,2021,BMJ Open,"Objectives The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for those diagnosed with eating disorders who report self-harm and suicidality. Design and setting This study was a retrospective cohort study within a secondary mental health service, South London and Maudsley National Health Service Trust. Participants All diagnosed with an F50 diagnosis of eating disorder from January 2009 to September 2019 were included. Intervention and measures Electronic health records (EHRs) for these patients were extracted and two natural language processing tools were used to determine documentation of self-harm and suicidality in their clinical notes. These tools were validated manually for attribute agreement scores within this study. Results The attribute agreements for precision of positive mentions of self-harm were 0.96 and for suicidality were 0.80; this demonstrates a € near perfect' and € strong' agreement and highlights the reliability of the tools in identifying the EHRs reporting self-harm or suicidality. There were 7434 patients with EHRs available and diagnosed with eating disorders included in the study from the dates January 2007 to September 2019. Of these, 4591 (61.8%) had a mention of self-harm within their records and 4764 (64.0%) had a mention of suicidality; 3899 (52.4%) had mentions of both. Patients reporting either self-harm or suicidality were more likely to have a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN) (self-harm, AN OR=3.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 11.3, p=0.04; suicidality, AN OR=8.20, 95% CI 2.17 to 30.1; p=0.002). They were also more likely to have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (p≤0.001), bipolar disorder (p<0.001) or substance misuse disorder (p<0.001). Conclusion A high percentage of patients (>60%) diagnosed with eating disorders report either self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Relative to other eating disorders, those diagnosed with AN were more likely to report either self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Psychiatric comorbidity, in particular borderline personality disorder and substance misuse, was also associated with an increase risk in self-harm and suicidality. Therefore, risk assessment among patients diagnosed with eating disorders is crucial.",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053808,16,Scopus,85122621732,2-s2.0-85122621732,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122621732
Prediction of chronic postsurgical pain in adults: A protocol for multivariable prediction model development,Papadomanolakis-Pakis N.,2021,BMJ Open,"Introduction Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is a condition that affects an estimated 10%-50% of adults, depending on the surgical procedure. CPSP often interferes with activities of daily living and may have a negative impact on quality of life, emotional and physical well-being. Clinical prediction models can help clinicians target preventive strategies towards patients at high-risk of CPSP. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a clinically applicable and generalisable prediction model for CPSP in adults. Methods and analysis This research will be a prospective single-centre observational cohort study in Denmark spanning approximately 1 year or until a predefined number of patients are recruited (n=1526). Adult patients aged 18 years and older scheduled to undergo surgery will be recruited at Aarhus University Hospital. The primary outcome is CPSP 3 months after surgery defined as average pain intensity at rest or on movement ≥3 on numerical rating scale (NRS) within the past week, and/or average pain interference ≥3 on NRS among any of seven short-form Brief Pain Inventory items in the past week (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work (including housework), relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life). Logistic regression will be used to conduct multivariate analysis. Predictive model performance will be evaluated by discrimination, calibration and model classification. Ethics and dissemination This research has been approved by Central Region Denmark and will be conducted in accordance with the Danish Data Protection Act and Declaration of Helsinki. Study findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publication. A CPSP risk calculator (CPSP-RC) will be developed based on predictors retained in the final models. The CPSP-RC will be made available online and as a mobile application to be easily accessible for clinical use and future research including validation and clinical impact assessments.

Quoted text in the mental healthcare electronic record: An analysis of the distribution and content of single-word quotations,Jayasinghe L.,2021,BMJ Open,"Objective To investigate the distribution and content of quoted text within the electronic health records (EHRs) using a previously developed natural language processing tool to generate a database of quotations. Design χ 2 and logistic regression were used to assess the profile of patients receiving mental healthcare for whom quotations exist. K-means clustering using pre-trained word embeddings developed on general discharge summaries and psychosis specific mental health records were used to group one-word quotations into semantically similar groups and labelled by human subjective judgement. Setting EHRs from a large mental healthcare provider serving a geographic catchment area of 1.3 million residents in South London. Participants For analysis of distribution, 33 499 individuals receiving mental healthcare on 30 June 2019 in South London and Maudsley. For analysis of content, 1587 unique lemmatised words, appearing a minimum of 20 times on the database of quotations created on 16 January 2020. Results The strongest individual indicator of quoted text is inpatient care in the preceding 12 months (OR 9.79, 95% CI 7.84 to 12.23). Next highest indicator is ethnicity with those with a black background more likely to have quoted text in comparison to white background (OR 2.20, 95% CI 2.08 to 2.33). Both are attenuated slightly in the adjusted model. Early psychosis intervention word embeddings subjectively produced categories pertaining to: mental illness, verbs, negative sentiment, people/relationships, mixed sentiment, aggression/violence and negative connotation. Conclusions The findings that inpatients and those from a black ethnic background more commonly have quoted text raise important questions around where clinical attention is focused and whether this may point to any systematic bias. Our study also shows that word embeddings trained on early psychosis intervention records are useful in categorising even small subsets of the clinical records represented by one-word quotations.",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049249,2,Scopus,85122634168,2-s2.0-85122634168,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122634168
Fostering university students’ engagement in teamwork and innovation behaviors through game-based learning (GBL),Martín-Hernández P.,2021,Sustainability Switzerland,"Higher Education Instituions (HEIs) should be the driving force behind the training of college students in terms of both hard and soft skills (for example, innovation and teamwork competencies), and they should also do so without neglecting their health and well-being, perhaps more than ever in these complex times of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Game-based learning (GBL) could be a powerful and useful tool in this regard. There is, however, some controversy surrounding the use of games for learning purposes in higher education institutions, and most of the research done about this issue corresponds to GBL through digital games. Under this background, the main objective of this study was to test the effect of GBL on the intrinsic motivation (IM), teamwork engagement (TWE), team building (TB), teamwork competence (TWC), and innovation behaviors (IWB) of 142 college students of Health Sciences and Social Work. After rehearsing in small groups, the game was tested (T2). Our results obtained through the differential analyses confirmed that undergraduates were more intrinsically motivated, experienced more TWE, TB, and TWC, and developed more IWB than before playing the game (T1). Therefore, the development of core personal skills might be promoted effectively by games in an efficient, engaging, and motivating way.",10.3390/su132413573,36,Scopus,85121129784,2-s2.0-85121129784,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121129784
Depression predictions from GPS-based mobility do not generalize well to large demographically heterogeneous samples,Müller S.R.,2021,Scientific Reports,"Depression is one of the most common mental health issues in the United States, affecting the lives of millions of people suffering from it as well as those close to them. Recent advances in research on mobile sensing technologies and machine learning have suggested that a person’s depression can be passively measured by observing patterns in people’s mobility behaviors. However, the majority of work in this area has relied on highly homogeneous samples, most frequently college students. In this study, we analyse over 57 million GPS data points to show that the same procedure that leads to high prediction accuracy in a homogeneous student sample (N = 57; AUC = 0.82), leads to accuracies only slightly higher than chance in a U.S.-wide sample that is heterogeneous in its socio-demographic composition as well as mobility patterns (N = 5,262; AUC = 0.57). This pattern holds across three different modelling approaches which consider both linear and non-linear relationships. Further analyses suggest that the prediction accuracy is low across different socio-demographic groups, and that training the models on more homogeneous subsamples does not substantially improve prediction accuracy. Overall, the findings highlight the challenge of applying mobility-based predictions of depression at scale.",10.1038/s41598-021-93087-x,42,Scopus,85109376947,2-s2.0-85109376947,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109376947
Extended classifier system with continuous real-coded variables for feature extraction of instantaneous pulse-rate variability and respiration of individuals with gaming disorder,Chi H.M.,2021,Biomedical Engineering Online,"Background: Individuals with gaming disorder (GD) exhibit autonomic nervous system responses that indicate dysfunctional emotion regulation. Pulse rate variability (PRV) is a valuable biomarker for investigating the autonomic function of patients with mental disorders. Because individuals with GD dynamically regulate emotions during gaming, the PRV response relating to GD is not well understood. To investigate the dynamic PRV responses of individuals with GD, this study proposed the indexes of instantaneous PRV (iPRV) and instantaneous respiratory frequency (IF<inf>resp</inf>) of arterial blood pressure signals using empirical mode decomposition and normalized direct-quadrature algorithms. iPRV consists of low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF), and very high-frequency (VHF) bands. Moreover, a novel method of extended classifier system with continuous real-coded variables (XCSR) was used to detect GD and extract GD-related iPRV features using iPRV and IF<inf>resp</inf> as input data. Results: A total of 32 college students without depressive and anxiety symptoms or cardiovascular diseases were recruited in this study. Participants were grouped into the high-risk GD and low-risk GD using both Chen Internet Addiction Scale and Internet Gaming Disorder Questionnaire. Their arterial blood pressures signals were measured while they watched gameplay videos with negative or positive emotional stimuli. Seven participants with high-risk GD exhibited significantly increased normalized VHF (nVHF) PRV and IF<inf>resp</inf> readings and significantly decreased normalized LF (nLF) PRV readings and LF/HF PRV ratios (from baseline) during negative or positive gameplay videos stimuli. These participants also exhibited higher nVHF PRV and lower nLF PRV readings and LF/HF PRV ratios when they experienced negative gameplay video stimuli relative to 17 participants with low-risk GD. The classification accuracy of the XCSR reached 90% for both negative and positive video stimuli, and nVHF PRV was most frequently used to detect GD risk. Conclusions: iPRV and IF<inf>resp</inf> can be used to detect GD and analyze the autonomic mechanism of individuals with GD.",10.1186/s12938-021-00930-3,3,Scopus,85115627948,2-s2.0-85115627948,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115627948
"How do you feel during the COVID-19 pandemic? A survey using psychological and linguistic self-report measures, and machine learning to investigate mental health, subjective experience, personality, and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students",Herbert C.,2021,BMC Psychology,"Background: The WHO has raised concerns about the psychological consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affecting health across societies, cultures and age-groups. Methods: This online survey study investigated mental health, subjective experience, and behaviour (health, learning/teaching) among university students studying in Egypt or Germany shortly after the first pandemic lockdown in May 2020. Psychological assessment included stable personality traits, self-concept and state-like psychological variables related to (a) mental health (depression, anxiety), (b) pandemic threat perception (feelings during the pandemic, perceived difficulties in describing, identifying, expressing emotions), (c) health (e.g., worries about health, bodily symptoms) and behaviour including perceived difficulties in learning. Assessment methods comprised self-report questions, standardized psychological scales, psychological questionnaires, and linguistic self-report measures. Data analysis comprised descriptive analysis of mental health, linguistic analysis of self-concept, personality and feelings, as well as correlational analysis and machine learning. N = 220 (107 women, 112 men, 1 = other) studying in Egypt or Germany provided answers to all psychological questionnaires and survey items. Results: Mean state and trait anxiety scores were significantly above the cut off scores that distinguish between high versus low anxious subjects. Depressive symptoms were reported by 51.82% of the student sample, the mean score was significantly above the screening cut off score for risk of depression. Worries about health (mental and physical health) and perceived difficulties in identifying feelings, and difficulties in learning behaviour relative to before the pandemic were also significant. No negative self-concept was found in the linguistic descriptions of the participants, whereas linguistic descriptions of feelings during the pandemic revealed a negativity bias in emotion perception. Machine learning (exploratory) predicted personality from the self-report data suggesting relations between personality and subjective experience that were not captured by descriptive or correlative data analytics alone. Conclusion: Despite small sample sizes, this multimethod survey provides important insight into mental health of university students studying in Egypt or Germany and how they perceived the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in May 2020. The results should be continued with larger samples to help develop psychological interventions that support university students across countries and cultures to stay psychologically resilient during the pandemic.",10.1186/s40359-021-00574-x,57,Scopus,85107210724,2-s2.0-85107210724,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107210724

Chatbots to Support Mental Wellbeing of People Living in Rural Areas: Can User Groups Contribute to Co-design?,Potts C.,2021,Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science,"Digital technologies such as chatbots can be used in the field of mental health. In particular, chatbots can be used to support citizens living in sparsely populated areas who face problems such as poor access to mental health services, lack of 24/7 support, barriers to engagement, lack of age appropriate support and reductions in health budgets. The aim of this study was to establish if user groups can design content for a chatbot to support the mental wellbeing of individuals in rural areas. University students and staff, mental health professionals and mental health service users (N = 78 total) were recruited to workshops across Northern Ireland, Ireland, Scotland, Finland and Sweden. The findings revealed that participants wanted a positive chatbot that was able to listen, support, inform and build a rapport with users. Gamification could be used within the chatbot to increase user engagement and retention. Content within the chatbot could include validated mental health scales and appropriate response triggers, such as signposting to external resources should the user disclose potentially harmful information or suicidal intent. Overall, the workshop participants identified user needs which can be transformed into chatbot requirements. Responsible design of mental healthcare chatbots should consider what users want or need, but also what chatbot features artificial intelligence can competently facilitate and which features mental health professionals would endorse.",10.1007/s41347-021-00222-6,35,Scopus,85130492971,2-s2.0-85130492971,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130492971
Are online mental health interventions for youth effective? A systematic review,Zhou X.,2021,Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare,"Objectives: This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of online mental health interventions for youth. Methods: We searched seven electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS) for the past 10 years to identify randomized controlled trials which have evaluated the use of telehealth interventions for young people with mental health problems. The included studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias. Results: Forty-five randomized controlled trials (n = 13,291 participants) were eligible for this review. Most studies (35 trials) evaluated the use of web-based self-help platforms to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (14 trials), mindfulness (four trials), acceptance commitment therapy (five trials) and positive psychology (two trials). Mobile/computer applications were used to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (four trials) and coping strategies training (two trials). Web-based synchronous chat (one trial) was used to assist communication between counsellors and participants. Three studies used artificial intelligence-based conversational agents to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (two trials) and problem-solving-strategy training (one trial). Eighty-two percent (n = 37) identified the participants as student population (i.e. university students, high school students). Sixty-four percent (n = 29) of the telehealth interventions were found to be effective in managing depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia and improving quality of life when compared with control conditions. Conclusions: Online mental health interventions were found to be effective in managing diverse mental health conditions among youth. Online self-help platforms were the most frequently used modality and artificial intelligence-based chatbots are merging as potential solutions. Future research is warranted to investigate the solutions to improve the retention rate and satisfaction of telehealth interventions among this population.",10.1177/1357633X211047285,71,Scopus,85118510391,2-s2.0-85118510391,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118510391
Identifying subtypes of depression in clinician-annotated text: a retrospective cohort study,Kung B.,2021,Scientific Reports,"Current criteria for depression are imprecise and do not accurately characterize its distinct clinical presentations. As a result, its diagnosis lacks clinical utility in both treatment and research settings. Data-driven efforts to refine criteria have typically focused on a limited set of symptoms that do not reflect the disorder’s heterogeneity. By contrast, clinicians often write about patients in depth, creating descriptions that may better characterize depression. However, clinical text is not commonly used to this end. Here we show that clinically relevant depressive subtypes can be derived from unstructured electronic health records. Five subtypes were identified amongst 18,314 patients with depression treated at a large mental healthcare provider by using unsupervised machine learning: severe-typical, psychotic, mild-typical, agitated, and anergic-apathetic. Subtypes were used to place patients in groups for validation; groups were found to be associated with future outcomes and characteristics that were consistent with the subtypes. These associations suggest that these categorizations are actionable due to their validity with respect to disease prognosis. Moreover, they were derived with automated techniques that might theoretically be widely implemented, allowing for future analyses in more varied populations and settings. Additional research, especially with respect to treatment response, may prove useful in further evaluation.",10.1038/s41598-021-01954-4,10,Scopus,85119247978,2-s2.0-85119247978,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119247978
"Insomnia in Bangladeshi Young Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Behavioral Factors, COVID-19 Risk and Fear, and Mental Health Issues",Hasan M.,2021,Sleep and Vigilance,"Background: Given the importance of sleep, several studies were conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh, but no study was conducted during the second wave. Thus, this study assessed the prevalence rate, associated factors, and predictive models of insomnia during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted during the second wave of the pandemic (within April 1–13, 2021) and collected information on sociodemographic, behavior and health, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, suicidality, and insomnia. A total of 756 data from Bangladeshi young adults (22.24 ± 4.39 years) were finally analyzed. Results: About 13% of the participants (n = 98 out of a total of 756) had the symptoms of insomnia. Insomnia had a significant gender difference, where females were more prone to be insomniac. Besides, middle class, urban residence, smoking status, not engaging in physical exercise, poor health status, and multi-comorbidities were also profoundly associated with insomnia. In addition, fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 risk, and mental health problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, and suicidality) showed a significant relationship in terms of insomnia. A total of 31.2% variance predicting insomnia was identified considering all of the studied variables. Conclusions: The prevalence of insomnia reported herein seems relatively lower than the prior studies, but this figure is not neglectable. Thus, the identified associated factors are highly suggested to consider in policy actions with a special focus on mental health problems to elevate the risk of sleep problems.",10.1007/s41782-021-00161-5,15,Scopus,85112505298,2-s2.0-85112505298,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112505298
Characterization of polycystic ovary syndrome among Flo app users around the world,Jain T.,2021,Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology,"Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and multi-faceted endocrine disorder that affects 5–20% of women. Literature is limited regarding potentially differing PCOS phenotypes among women around the world. Objective: To use Flo app technology to understand the multifaceted characteristics of PCOS across several countries and identify contributing risk factors to the development of this condition. Study design: Flo is a widely used female health and wellbeing app with period tracking functionality that provides a globally representative and medically unbiased perspective on PCOS symptomatology. A chatbot dialog on PCOS was subsequently administered on the Flo application (app) to users from 142 countries (with at least 100 respondents) who have the app running in English during September–October 2019. Results: For analyses, we selected the five countries with the greatest number of respondents: US (n = 243,238), UK (n = 68,325), India (n = 40,092), Philippines (n = 35,131), and Australia (n = 29,926). Bloating was the most frequently reported symptom among PCOS-positive women and appeared to be the main predictor of PCOS in our model (odds ratio 3·76 [95% CI 3·60–3·94]; p < 0·0001). Additional top predictors of PCOS are high blood cholesterol and glucose levels. As BMI increased, the percentage of women who reported a physician-confirmed PCOS diagnosis also increased. However, women in India did not follow this trend. Conclusion: Our findings are based on the largest known PCOS dataset and indicate that symptoms are more complex than previously understood. The most frequently reported symptoms (bloating, facial hirsutism, irregular cycles, hyperpigmentation, and baldness) are broader than those included in the Rotterdam criteria. Future work should reevaluate and refine the criteria utilized in PCOS diagnosis.",10.1186/s12958-021-00719-y,27,Scopus,85102010627,2-s2.0-85102010627,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102010627
Predictive modeling of depression and anxiety using electronic health records and a novel machine learning approach with artificial intelligence,Nemesure M.D.,2021,Scientific Reports,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly prevalent and impairing problems, but frequently go undetected, leading to substantial treatment delays. Electronic health records (EHRs) collect a great deal of biometric markers and patient characteristics that could foster the detection of GAD and MDD in primary care settings. We approached the problem of predicting MDD and GAD using a novel machine learning pipeline to re-analyze data from an observational study. The pipeline constitutes an ensemble of algorithmically distinct machine learning methods, including deep learning. A sample of 4,184 undergraduate students completed the study, undergoing a general health screening and completing a psychiatric assessment for MDD and GAD. After explicitly excluding all psychiatric information, 59 biomedical and demographic features from the general health survey in addition to a set of engineered features were used for model training. We assessed the model's performance on a held-out test set and found an AUC of 0.73 (sensitivity: 0.66, specificity: 0.7) and 0.67 (sensitivity: 0.55, specificity: 0.7) for GAD, and MDD, respectively. Additionally, we used advanced techniques (SHAP values) to illuminate which features had the greatest impact on prediction for each disease. The top predictive features for MDD were being satisfied with living conditions and having public health insurance. The top predictive features for GAD were vaccinations being up to date and marijuana use. Our results indicate moderate predictive performance for the application of machine learning methods in detection of GAD and MDD based on EHR data. By identifying important predictors of GAD and MDD, these results may be used in future research to aid in the early detection of MDD and GAD.",10.1038/s41598-021-81368-4,168,Scopus,85099832030,2-s2.0-85099832030,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099832030
Major depression disorder diagnosis and analysis based on structural magnetic resonance imaging and deep learning,Wang Y.,2021,Journal of Integrative Neuroscience,"Major depression disorder is one of the diseases with the highest rate of disability and morbidity and is associated with numerous structural and functional differences in neural systems. However, it is difficult to analyze digital medical imaging data without computational intervention. A voxel-wise densely connected convolutional neural network, Three-dimensional Densenet (3D-DenseNet), is proposed to mine the feature differences. In addition, a novel transfer learning method, called Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Transfer (ADNI-Transfer), is designed and combined with the proposed 3D-DenseNet. The experimental results on a database that contains 174 subjects, including 99 patients with major depression disorder and 75 healthy controls, show that large changes in brain structures between major depressive disorder patients and healthy controls mainly are located in the regions including superior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral, middle temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus. In addition, the proposed deep learning network can better extract different features of brain structures between major depressive disorder patients and healthy controls and achieve excellent classification results of major depressive disorder. At the same time, the designed transfer learning method can further improve classification performance. These results verify that our proposed method is feasible and valid for diagnosing and analyzing major depression disorder.",10.31083/j.jin2004098,14,Scopus,85122805545,2-s2.0-85122805545,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122805545
Identifying urban built environment factors in pregnancy care and maternal mental health outcomes,Zhang Y.,2021,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,"Backgrounds: Risk factors related to the built environment have been associated with women’s mental health and preventive care. This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting. Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients’ residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients’ residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. Results: We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality. Conclusions: In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD. Findings may inform urban design policies and provide awareness for care providers on the association of patients’ residing neighborhoods and healthy pregnancy.",10.1186/s12884-021-04056-1,15,Scopus,85114312834,2-s2.0-85114312834,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114312834
Estimation of postpartum depression risk from electronic health records using machine learning,Amit G.,2021,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,"Background: Postpartum depression is a widespread disorder, adversely affecting the well-being of mothers and their newborns. We aim to utilize machine learning for predicting risk of postpartum depression (PPD) using primary care electronic health records (EHR) data, and to evaluate the potential value of EHR-based prediction in improving the accuracy of PPD screening and in early identification of women at risk. Methods: We analyzed EHR data of 266,544 women from the UK who gave first live birth between 2000 and 2017. We extracted a multitude of socio-demographic and medical variables and constructed a machine learning model that predicts the risk of PPD during the year following childbirth. We evaluated the model’s performance using multiple validation methodologies and measured its accuracy as a stand-alone tool and as an adjunct to the standard questionnaire-based screening by Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). Results: The prevalence of PPD in the analyzed cohort was 13.4%. Combing EHR-based prediction with EPDS score increased the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) from 0.805 to 0.844 and the sensitivity from 0.72 to 0.76, at specificity of 0.80. The AUC of the EHR-based prediction model alone varied from 0.72 to 0.74 and decreased by only 0.01–0.02 when applied as early as before the beginning of pregnancy. Conclusions: PPD risk prediction using EHR data may provide a complementary quantitative and objective tool for PPD screening, allowing earlier (pre-pregnancy) and more accurate identification of women at risk, timely interventions and potentially improved outcomes for the mother and child.",10.1186/s12884-021-04087-8,51,Scopus,85115155259,2-s2.0-85115155259,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115155259
Digital public health surveillance: a systematic scoping review,Shakeri Hossein Abad Z.,2021,Npj Digital Medicine,"The ubiquitous and openly accessible information produced by the public on the Internet has sparked an increasing interest in developing digital public health surveillance (DPHS) systems. We conducted a systematic scoping review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to consolidate and characterize the existing research on DPHS and identify areas for further research. We used Natural Language Processing and content analysis to define the search strings and searched Global Health, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar from 2005 to January 2020 for peer-reviewed articles on DPHS, with extensive hand searching. Seven hundred fifty-five articles were included in this review. The studies were from 54 countries and utilized 26 digital platforms to study 208 sub-categories of 49 categories associated with 16 public health surveillance (PHS) themes. Most studies were conducted by researchers from the United States (56%, 426) and dominated by communicable diseases-related topics (25%, 187), followed by behavioural risk factors (17%, 131). While this review discusses the potentials of using Internet-based data as an affordable and instantaneous resource for DPHS, it highlights the paucity of longitudinal studies and the methodological and inherent practical limitations underpinning the successful implementation of a DPHS system. Little work studied Internet users’ demographics when developing DPHS systems, and 39% (291) of studies did not stratify their results by geographic region. A clear methodology by which the results of DPHS can be linked to public health action has yet to be established, as only six (0.8%) studies deployed their system into a PHS context.",10.1038/s41746-021-00407-6,57,Scopus,85102008609,2-s2.0-85102008609,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102008609
Mental health trajectories of individuals and families following the COVID-19 pandemic: Study protocol of a longitudinal investigation and prevention program,Langhammer T.,2021,Mental Health and Prevention,"Introduction: Many adults, adolescents and children are suffering from persistent stress symptoms in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to characterize long-term trajectories of mental health and to reduce the transition to manifest mental disorders by means of a stepped care program for indicated prevention. Methods and analysis: Using a prospective-longitudinal design, we will assess the mental strain of the pandemic using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and Spence Child Anxiety Scale. Hair samples will be collected to assess cortisol as a biological stress marker of the previous months. Additionally, we will implement a stepped-care program with online- and face-to-face-interventions for adults, adolescents, and children. After that we will assess long-term trajectories of mental health at 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. The primary outcome will be psychological distress (depression, anxiety and somatoform symptoms). Data will be analyzed with general linear model and machine learning. This study will contribute to the understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. The evaluation of the stepped-care program and longitudinal investigation will inform clinicians and mental health stakeholders on populations at risk, disease trajectories and the sufficiency of indicated prevention to ameliorate the mental strain of the pandemic.

Improving body image at scale among Brazilian adolescents: study protocol for the co-creation and randomised trial evaluation of a chatbot intervention,Matheson E.L.,2021,BMC Public Health,"Background: Body image concerns are prevalent among Brazilian adolescents and can lead to poor psychological and physical health. Yet, there is a scarcity of culturally-appropriate, evidence-based interventions that have been evaluated and made widely available. Chatbot technology (i.e., software that mimics written or spoken human speech) offers an innovative method to increase the scalability of mental health interventions for adolescents. The present protocol outlines the co-creation and evaluation of a body image chatbot for Brazilian adolescents via a partnership between academics, industry organisations and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Methods: A two-armed fully remote randomised controlled trial will evaluate the chatbot’s effectiveness at improving body image and well-being. Adolescent girls and boys (N = 2800) aged 13–18 years recruited online will be randomly allocated (1:1) into either: 1) a body image chatbot or 2) an assessment-only control condition. Adolescents will engage with the chatbot over a 72-hour period on Facebook Messenger. Primary outcomes will assess the immediate and short-term impact of the chatbot on state- and trait-based body image, respectively. Secondary outcomes will include state- and trait-based affect, trait self-efficacy and treatment adherence. Discussion: This research is the first to develop an evidence-informed body image chatbot for Brazilian adolescents, with the proposed efficacy trial aiming to provide support for accessible, scalable and cost-effective interventions that address disparities in body image prevalence and readily available resources.

Depression Intensity Estimation via Social Media: A Deep Learning Approach,Ghosh S.,2021,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,"Depression has become a big problem in our society today. It is also a major reason for suicide, especially among teenagers. In the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the affected countries have recommended social distancing and lockdown measures. Resulting in interpersonal isolation, these measures have raised serious concerns for mental health and depression. Generally, clinical psychologists diagnose depressed people via face-to-face interviews following the clinical depression criteria. However, often patients tend to not consult doctors in their early stages of depression. Nowadays, people are increasingly using social media to express their moods. In this article, we aim to predict depressed users as well as estimate their depression intensity via leveraging social media (Twitter) data, in order to aid in raising an alarm. We model this problem as a supervised learning task. We start with weakly labeling the Twitter data in a self-supervised manner. A rich set of features, including emotional, topical, behavioral, user level, and depression-related n -gram features, are extracted to represent each user. Using these features, we train a small long short-term memory (LSTM) network using Swish as an activation function, to predict the depression intensities. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We outperform the baseline models for depression intensity estimation by achieving the lowest mean squared error of 1.42 and also outperform the existing state-of-the-art binary classification method by more than 2% of accuracy. We found that the depressed users frequently use negative words such as stress and sad, mostly post during late nights, highly use personal pronouns and sometimes also share personal events.",10.1109/TCSS.2021.3084154,128,Scopus,85107367572,2-s2.0-85107367572,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107367572
"A prospective, randomized, single-blinded, crossover trial to investigate the effect of a wearable device in addition to a daily symptom diary for the remote early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-RED): a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",Brakenhoff T.B.,2021,Trials,"Objectives: It is currently thought that most—but not all—individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop symptoms, but that the infectious period starts on average two days before the first overt symptoms appear. It is estimated that pre- and asymptomatic individuals are responsible for more than half of all transmissions. By detecting infected individuals before they have overt symptoms, wearable devices could potentially and significantly reduce the proportion of transmissions by pre-symptomatic individuals. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests [to determine if there are antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in the blood] or SARS-CoV-2 infection tests such as polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the following two algorithms to detect first time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection:the algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo; experimental condition)the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone (Symptom Only Algo; control condition) In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. Trial design: The trial is a randomized, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial. All subjects will participate in an initial Learning Phase (varying from 2 weeks to 3 months depending on enrolment date), followed by two contiguous 3-month test phases, Period 1 and Period 2. Each subject will undergo the experimental condition (the Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) in one of these periods and the control condition (Symptom Only Algo) in the other period. The order will be randomly assigned, resulting in subjects being allocated 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition first) or Sequence 2 (control condition first). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. Participants: The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. A target of 20,000 subjects will be enrolled. Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk individuals and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Subjects will be recruited from previously studied cohorts as well as via public campaigns and social media. All data for this study will be collected remotely through the Ava COVID-RED app, the Ava bracelet, surveys in the COVID-RED web portal, and self-sampling serology and PCR kits. During recruitment, subjects will be invited to visit the COVID-RED web portal (www.covid-red.eu). After successfully completing the enrolment questionnaire, meeting eligibility criteria and indicating interest in joining the study, subjects will receive the subject information sheet and informed consent form. Subjects can enrol in COVID-RED if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria:Resident of the NetherlandsAt least 18 years oldInformed consent provided (electronic)Willing to adhere to the study procedures described in the protocolMust have a smartphone that runs at least Android 8.0 or iOS 13.0 operating systems and is active for the duration of the study (in the case of a change of mobile number, study team should be notified)Be able to read, understand and write Dutch Exclusion criteria:Previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (confirmed either through PCR/antigen or antibody tests; self-reported)Previously received a vaccine developed specifically for COVID-19 or in possession of an appointment for vaccination in the near future (self-reported)Current suspected (e.g., waiting for test result) COVID-19 infection or symptoms of a COVID-19 infection (self-reported)Participating in any other COVID-19 clinical drug, vaccine, or medical device trial (self-reported)Electronic implanted device (such as a pacemaker; self-reported)Pregnant at time of informed consent (self-reported)Suffering from cholinergic urticaria (per the Ava bracelet’s User Manual; self-reported)Staff involved in the management or conduct of this study Intervention and comparator: All subjects will be instructed to complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app daily, wear their Ava bracelet each night and synchronise it with the app each day for the entire period of study participation. Provided with wearable sensor and/or self-reported symptom data within the last 24 hours, the Ava COVID-RED app’s underlying algorithms will provide subjects with a real-time indicator of their overall health and well-being. Subjects will see one of three messages, notifying them that: no seeming deviations in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected; some changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected and they should self-isolate; or alerting them that deviations in their symptoms and/or physiological parameters could be suggestive of a potential COVID-19 infection and to seek additional testing. We will assess intraperson performance of the algorithms in the experimental condition (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) and control conditions (Symptom Only Algo). Main outcomes: The trial will evaluate the use and performance of the Ava COVID-RED app and Ava bracelet, which uses sensors to measure breathing rate, pulse rate, skin temperature, and heart rate variability for the purpose of early and asymptomatic detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in general and high-risk populations. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests, PCR tests and/or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the following two algorithms to detect first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava Bracelet data when coupled with the self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data, and the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone. In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. The protocol contains an additional seventeen secondary outcomes which address infection incidence rates, health resource utilization, symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected participants, and the rate of breakthrough and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. PCR or antigen testing will occur when the subject receives a notification from the algorithm to seek additional testing. Subjects will be advised to get tested via the national testing programme, and report the testing result in the Ava COVID-RED app and a survey. If they cannot obtain a test via the national testing programme, they will receive a nasal swab self-sampling kit at home, and the sample will be tested by PCR in a trial-affiliated laboratory. In addition, all subjects will be asked to take a capillary blood sample at home at baseline (Month 0), and at the end of the Learning Phase (Month 3), Period 1 (Month 6) and Period 2 (Month 9). These samples will be used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody testing in a trial-affiliated laboratory, differentiating between antibodies resulting from a natural infection and antibodies resulting from COVID-19 vaccination (as vaccination will gradually be rolled out during the trial period). Baseline samples will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of the Learning Phase is positive, and samples collected at the end of Period 1 will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of Period 2 is positive. When subjects obtain a positive PCR/antigen or serology test result during the study, they will continue to be in the study but will be moved into a so-called “COVID-positive” mode in the Ava COVID-RED app. This means that they will no longer receive recommendations from the algorithms but can still contribute and track symptom and bracelet data. The primary analysis of the main objective will be executed using data collected in Period 2 (Month 6 through 9). Within this period, serology tests (before and after Period 2) and PCR/antigen tests (taken based on recommendations by the algorithms) will be used to determine if a subject was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. Within this same time period, it will be determined if the algorithms gave any recommendations for testing. The agreement between these quantities will be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and how these compare between the study conditions. Randomisation: All eligible subjects will be randomized using a stratified block randomization approach with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to one of two sequences (experimental condition followed by control condition or control condition followed by experimental condition). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence, resulting in equal numbers of high-risk and normal-risk individuals between the sequences. Blinding (masking): In this study, subjects will be blinded as to study condition and randomization sequence. Relevant study staff and the device manufacturer will be aware of the assigned sequence. The subject will wear the Ava bracelet and complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app for the full duration of the study, and they will not know if the feedback they receive about their potential infection status will only be based on data they entered in the Daily Symptom Diary within the Ava COVID-RED app or based on both the data from the Daily Symptom Diary and the Ava bracelet. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): 20,000 subjects will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition followed by control condition) or Sequence 2 (control condition followed by experimental condition), taking into account their risk level. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence.

21-day stress detox: Open trial of a universal well-being chatbot for young adults,Williams R.,2021,Social Sciences,"There has been a lot of interest in digital mental health interventions but adherence to online programmes has been less than optimal. Chatbots that mimic brief conversations may be a more engaging and acceptable mode of delivery. We developed a chatbot, called 21-Day Stress Detox, to deliver stress management techniques for young adults. The purpose of the study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of this low-intensity digital mental health intervention in a non-clinical population of young adults. The content was derived from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and included evidence-informed elements such as mindfulness and gratitude journaling. It was delivered over 21 daily sessions using the Facebook Messenger platform. Each session was intended to last about 5–7 min and included text, animated GIFs, relaxation tracks and reflective exercises. We conducted an open single-arm trial collecting app usage through passive data collection as well as self-rated satisfaction and qualitative (open-ended) feedback. Efficacy was assessed via outcome measures of well-being (World Health Organisation (Five) Well-being Index; WHO-5; and Personal Well-being Measure; ONS4); stress (Perceived Stress Scale–10 item version; PSS-10); and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale; GAD-7). One hundred and ten of the 124 participants who completed baseline commenced the chatbot and 64 returned the post-intervention assessment. Eighty-one percent were female and 51% were first year students. Forty-five percent were NZ European and 41% were Asian. Mean engagement was 11 days out 21 days (SD = 7.8). Most (81%) found the chatbot easy to use. Sixty-three percent rated their satisfaction as 7 out of 10 or higher. Qualitative feedback revealed that convenience and relatable content were the most valued features. There was a statistically significant improvement on the WHO-5 of 7.38 (SD = 15.07; p < 0.001) and a mean reduction on the PSS-10 of 1.77 (SD = 4.69; p = 0.004) equating to effect sizes of 0.49 and 0.38, respectively. Those who were clinically anxious at baseline (n = 25) experienced a greater reduction of GAD-7 symptoms than those (n = 39) who started the study without clinical anxiety (−1.56, SD = 3.31 vs. 0.67, SD = 3.30; p = 0.011). Using a chatbot to deliver universal psychological support appears to be feasible, acceptable, have good levels of engagement, and lead to significant improvements in well-being and stress. Future iterations of the chatbot should involve a more personalised content.",10.3390/socsci10110416,24,Scopus,85121629602,2-s2.0-85121629602,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121629602
Using Machine Learning to Predict Young People’s Internet Health and Social Service Information Seeking,Comulada W.S.,2021,Prevention Science,"Machine learning creates new opportunities to design digital health interventions for youth at risk for acquiring HIV (YARH), capitalizing on YARH’s health information seeking on the internet. To date, researchers have focused on descriptive analyses that associate individual factors with health-seeking behaviors, without estimating of the strength of these predictive models. We developed predictive models by applying machine learning methods (i.e., elastic net and lasso regression models) to YARH’s self-reports of internet use. The YARH were aged 14–24 years old (N = 1287) from Los Angeles and New Orleans. Models were fit to three binary indicators of YARH’s lifetime internet searches for general health, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and social service information. YARH responses regarding internet health information seeking were fed into machine learning models with potential predictor variables based on findings from previous research, including sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and gender minority identity, healthcare access and engagement, sexual behavior, substance use, and mental health. About half of the YARH reported seeking general health and SRH information and 26% sought social service information. Areas under the ROC curve (≥.75) indicated strong predictive models and results were consistent with the existing literature. For example, higher education and sexual minority identification was associated with seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. New findings also emerged. Cisgender identity versus transgender and non-binary identities was associated with lower odds of general health, SRH, and social service information seeking. Experiencing intimate partner violence was associated with higher odds of seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. Findings demonstrate the ability to develop predictive models to inform targeted health information dissemination strategies but underscore the need to better understand health disparities that can be operationalized as predictors in machine learning algorithms.",10.1007/s11121-021-01255-2,9,Scopus,85105866157,2-s2.0-85105866157,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105866157
Using social media Reddit data to examine foster families' concerns and needs during COVID-19,Lee J.Y.,2021,Child Abuse and Neglect,"Background: COVID-19 is likely to have negatively impacted foster families but few data sources are available to confirm this. Objective: The current study used Reddit social media data to examine how foster families are faring in the pandemic. Discussion topics were identified and examined for changes before and after COVID-19. Participants and setting: Comments were collected from three Reddit online discussion boards dedicated to foster families (N = 11,830). Methods: We used machine learning techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, for topic modeling and textual analysis for qualitative coding of the Reddit comments. Results: Results showed that three main topics had both significant quantitative and meaningful qualitative changes before and after COVID-19. There were significant increases in conversation about becoming a foster parent (F = 5.75, p = 0.02) and activities for foster children (F = 10.61, p = 0.001), whereas there was a significant decrease in discussing permanency (F = 9.46, p = 0.003) before and after the onset of COVID-19. Qualitative coding showed that regarding the topic of becoming a parent, excitement over approval of foster care license before COVID-19 shifted to foster families' increased anxieties about delays in their licensing cases after COVID-19. For permanency, content changed from the best interest of the child and reunifications before COVID-19 to concerns over family separations and permanency challenges after COVID-19. Regarding activities for foster children, content related to everyday activities before COVID-19 changed to specific activities foster children and families could do during lockdowns. Results suggest areas child welfare workers may focus on to better support foster families during and after the pandemic.",10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105262,26,Scopus,85104788524,2-s2.0-85104788524,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104788524
Two-Step Model for Emotion Detection on Twitter Users: A Covid-19 Case Study in Malaysia,Razak C.S.A.,2021,Malaysian Journal of Computer Science,"Human emotion is often a reflection of one’s behaviour that leads to awareness of one’s mental health. Emotion detection on Twitter users specifically gains attention as it generates information that is useful in the field of psychology and linguistics. However, most existing works related to the subject analysed the emotion of a tweet based on the number of keywords or phrases in it, thus resulting in false annotations and eventually false judgement of the user’s emotion. This paper proposes a two-step model with high and reliable accuracy to detect the emotion of Twitter users based on the semantic meaning of the tweets they posted. The first step classified the emotion of each tweet using four different deep learning techniques. The second step detected the emotion of the user based on the proposed statistical post-level features and a boosting technique. Then, Kappa’s agreement score method was implemented to validate both models. The first step achieved 0.9482 in accuracy while the second step achieved 0.9683 in accuracy. To further validate such highly accurate result, a case study was conducted, and a web-based system was developed to analyse the emotion of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our analysis corresponded to most of the current reports on the pandemic which further proved the reliability of the developed model.",10.22452/mjcs.vol34no4.4,4,Scopus,85121507745,2-s2.0-85121507745,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121507745
The Effect of College Students' Adaptability on Nomophobia: Based on Lasso Regression,Luo J.,2021,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Smartphones can improve our lives, but also consume our lives. It is known that problematic mobile phone use, such as nomophobia, can lead to some mental health problems. So far, psychological factors behind nomophobia were yet to be fully discovered. Previous studies showed that individuals' adaptability was closely related to nomophobia. However, adaptability was a complex construct that contains various components, and it was unclear whether these components contributed equally to nomophobia. This study investigated 678 college students by using Chinese versions of the nomophobia questionnaire, mobile phone addiction tendency scale, and freshmen adaptability scale. Lasso regression was used to further explore the key factors that could affect nomophobia. Model results showed that the value of λ+1se was [0.303, 0.423] at the minimum mean squared error in the training data. Emotional adaptability significantly predicted the fear of being unable to access information (β = −0.022, p < 0.001), losing convenience (β = −0.067, p < 0.001), and losing Internet connection (β = −0.003, p < 0.01) after λ+1se was included in the testing data, and the R<sup>2</sup> were 0.496, 0.483, and 0.493. Homesickness adaptability significantly predicted the fear of losing contact (β = −0.056, p < 0.05), and R<sup>2</sup> was 0.508. In addition, similar results were obtained by using datasets of mobile phone addiction and adaptability. Therefore, we concluded that the emotional adaptability has an important effect on nomophobia. Additionally, we also found that homesickness adaptability has an important role in predicting fear of losing contact.",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.641417,10,Scopus,85119053159,2-s2.0-85119053159,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119053159
MOSafely: Building an Open-Source HCAI Community to Make the Internet a Safer Place for Youth,Caddle X.V.,2021,Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work CSCW,"The goal of this one-day workshop is to build an active community of researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers who are jointly committed to leveraging human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) to make the internet a safer place for youth. This community will be founded on the principles of open innovation and human dignity to address some of the most salient safety issues of modern-day internet, including online harassment, sexual solicitation, and the mental health of vulnerable internet users, particularly adolescents and young adults. We will partner with Mozilla Research Foundation to launch a new open project named ""MOSafely.org,""which will serve as a platform for code library, research, and data contributions that support the mission of internet safety. During the workshop, we will discuss: 1) the types of contributions and technical standards needed to advance the state-of-the art in online risk detection, 2) the practical, legal, and ethical challenges that we will face, and 3) ways in which we can overcome these challenges through the use of HCAI to create a sustainable community.

Detecting subclinical social anxiety using physiological data from a wrist-worn wearable: Small-scale feasibility study,Shaukat-Jali R.,2021,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Subclinical (ie, threshold) social anxiety can greatly affect young people’s lives, but existing solutions appear inadequate considering its rising prevalence. Wearable sensors may provide a novel way to detect social anxiety and result in new opportunities for monitoring and treatment, which would be greatly beneficial for persons with social anxiety, society, and health care services. Nevertheless, indicators such as skin temperature measured by wrist-worn sensors have not been used in prior work on physiological social anxiety detection. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether subclinical social anxiety in young adults can be detected using physiological data obtained from wearable sensors, including heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity (EDA). Methods: Young adults (N=12) with self-reported subclinical social anxiety (measured using the widely used self-reported version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) participated in an impromptu speech task. Physiological data were collected using an E4 Empatica wearable device. Using the preprocessed data and following a supervised machine learning approach, various classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) were used to develop models for 3 different contexts. Models were trained to differentiate (1) between baseline and socially anxious states, (2) among baseline, anticipation anxiety, and reactive anxiety states, and (3) social anxiety among individuals with social anxiety of differing severity. The predictive capability of the singular modalities was also explored in each of the 3 supervised learning experiments. The generalizability of the developed models was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation as a performance index. Results: With modalities combined, the developed models yielded accuracies between 97.54% and 99.48% when differentiating between baseline and socially anxious states. Models trained to differentiate among baseline, anticipation anxiety, and reactive anxiety states yielded accuracies between 95.18% and 98.10%. Furthermore, the models developed to differentiate between social anxiety experienced by individuals with anxiety of differing severity scores successfully classified with accuracies between 98.86% and 99.52%. Surprisingly, EDA was identified as the most effective singular modality when differentiating between baseline and social anxiety states, whereas ST was the most effective modality when differentiating anxiety among individuals with social anxiety of differing severity. Conclusions: The results indicate that it is possible to accurately detect social anxiety as well as distinguish between levels of severity in young adults by leveraging physiological data collected from wearable sensors.",10.2196/32656,27,Scopus,85117192190,2-s2.0-85117192190,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117192190
Digital biomarkers for depression screening with wearable devices: Cross-sectional study with machine learning modeling,Rykov Y.,2021,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that is undiagnosed and untreated in half of all cases. Wearable activity trackers collect fine-grained sensor data characterizing the behavior and physiology of users (ie, digital biomarkers), which could be used for timely, unobtrusive, and scalable depression screening. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the predictive ability of digital biomarkers, based on sensor data from consumer-grade wearables, to detect risk of depression in a working population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 290 healthy working adults. Participants wore Fitbit Charge 2 devices for 14 consecutive days and completed a health survey, including screening for depressive symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), at baseline and 2 weeks later. We extracted a range of known and novel digital biomarkers characterizing physical activity, sleep patterns, and circadian rhythms from wearables using steps, heart rate, energy expenditure, and sleep data. Associations between severity of depressive symptoms and digital biomarkers were examined with Spearman correlation and multiple regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders, including sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol consumption, smoking, self-rated health, subjective sleep characteristics, and loneliness. Supervised machine learning with statistically selected digital biomarkers was used to predict risk of depression (ie, symptom severity and screening status). We used varying cutoff scores from an acceptable PHQ-9 score range to define the depression group and different subsamples for classification, while the set of statistically selected digital biomarkers remained the same. For the performance evaluation, we used k-fold cross-validation and obtained accuracy measures from the holdout folds. Results: A total of 267 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 33 (SD 8.6, range 21-64) years. Out of 267 participants, there was a mild female bias displayed (n=170, 63.7%). The majority of the participants were Chinese (n=211, 79.0%), single (n=163, 61.0%), and had a university degree (n=238, 89.1%). We found that a greater severity of depressive symptoms was robustly associated with greater variation of nighttime heart rate between 2 AM and 4 AM and between 4 AM and 6 AM; it was also associated with lower regularity of weekday circadian rhythms based on steps and estimated with nonparametric measures of interdaily stability and autocorrelation as well as fewer steps-based daily peaks. Despite several reliable associations, our evidence showed limited ability of digital biomarkers to detect depression in the whole sample of working adults. However, in balanced and contrasted subsamples comprised of depressed and healthy participants with no risk of depression (ie, no or minimal depressive symptoms), the model achieved an accuracy of 80%, a sensitivity of 82%, and a specificity of 78% in detecting subjects at high risk of depression. Conclusions: Digital biomarkers that have been discovered and are based on behavioral and physiological data from consumer wearables could detect increased risk of depression and have the potential to assist in depression screening, yet current evidence shows limited predictive ability. Machine learning models combining these digital biomarkers could discriminate between individuals with a high risk of depression and individuals with no risk.",10.2196/24872,97,Scopus,85118496844,2-s2.0-85118496844,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118496844
Natural language processing for cognitive therapy: Extracting schemas from thought records,Burger F.,2021,Plos One,"The cognitive approach to psychotherapy aims to change patients' maladaptive schemas, that is, overly negative views on themselves, the world, or the future. To obtain awareness of these views, they record their thought processes in situations that caused pathogenic emotional responses. The schemas underlying such thought records have, thus far, been largely manually identified. Using recent advances in natural language processing, we take this one step further by automatically extracting schemas from thought records. To this end, we asked 320 healthy participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to each complete five thought records consisting of several utterances reflecting cognitive processes. Agreement between two raters on manually scoring the utterances with respect to how much they reflect each schema was substantial (Cohen's κ = 0.79). Natural language processing software pretrained on all English Wikipedia articles from 2014 (GLoVE embeddings) was used to represent words and utterances, which were then mapped to schemas using k-nearest neighbors algorithms, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks. For the more frequently occurring schemas, all algorithms were able to leverage linguistic patterns. For example, the scores assigned to the Competence schema by the algorithms correlated with the manually assigned scores with Spearman correlations ranging between 0.64 and 0.76. For six of the nine schemas, a set of recurrent neural networks trained separately for each of the schemas outperformed the other algorithms. We present our results here as a benchmark solution, since we conducted this research to explore the possibility of automatically processing qualitative mental health data and did not aim to achieve optimal performance with any of the explored models. The dataset of 1600 thought records comprising 5747 utterances is published together with this article for researchers and machine learning enthusiasts to improve upon our outcomes. Based on our promising results, we see further opportunities for using free-text input and subsequent natural language processing in other common therapeutic tools, such as ecological momentary assessments, automated case conceptualizations, and, more generally, as an alternative to mental health scales.",10.1371/journal.pone.0257832,13,Scopus,85119043007,2-s2.0-85119043007,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119043007
"The growing field of digital psychiatry: current evidence and the future of apps, social media, chatbots, and virtual reality",Torous J.,2021,World Psychiatry,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth, mobile mental health technologies – such as smartphone apps, vir­tual reality, chatbots, and social media – have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for “digital phenotyping” and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self-management of psychological well-being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long-term psychiatric conditions – including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders – as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real-world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.",10.1002/wps.20883,682,Scopus,85114667523,2-s2.0-85114667523,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114667523
Learning about the current state of digital mental health interventions for canadian youth to inform future decision-making: Mixed methods study,Kemp J.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for youth mental health services in Canada as disruptions to clinical care continue to persist due to the risk of transmission and exposure to the virus. Digital mental health interventions, including web-based resources and mobile apps, have provided opportunities to support youth mental health remotely across Canada. There is a need to better understand how these digital interventions are being selected, recommended, and used in various regions across Canada. Objective: A national jurisdictional scan was completed to (1) determine what web-based programs, apps, and websites are promoted and licensed in Canada for youth mental health; (2) identify criteria and decision-making processes that Canadian jurisdictions use to select web-based programs, apps, and websites for youth mental health; and (3) identify upcoming trends, innovations, and digital mental health possibilities that are emerging in the youth sector. Methods: The aims of the jurisdictional scan were addressed through a review of related academic and grey literature; stakeholder interviews, including individuals involved in various areas of the youth mental health sector; and a social media review of pertinent Twitter content. Results: A total of 66 web-based resources and apps were identified for use by youth in Canada. 16 stakeholder interviews were completed and included discussions with researchers, clinicians, youth organizations, and others involved in digital interventions for youth mental health. These discussions identified a limited use of frameworks used to guide decision-making processes when selecting digital interventions. Many clinicians agreed on a similar set of eligibility requirements for youth mental health apps and digital resources, such as the evidence base and cultural relevance of the intervention. Stakeholders also identified upcoming trends and innovations in the youth digital mental health space, including artificial intelligence, digital phenotyping, and personalized therapy. Over 4 weeks, 2184 tweets were reviewed to identify and compare global and national trends and innovations involving digital mental health and youth. Key trends included the promotion of regional chat services as well as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health and access to care. Conclusions: As organizations begin to plan for the delivery of mental health care following the pandemic, there are concerns about the sustainability of these digital mental health interventions as well as a need for services to be more informed by the experiences and preferences of youth.",10.2196/30491,13,Scopus,85117882674,2-s2.0-85117882674,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117882674
Forecasting the suitability of online mental health information for effective self-care developing machine learning classifiers using natural language features,Ji M.,2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Background: Online mental health information represents important resources for people living with mental health issues. Suitability of mental health information for effective self-care remains understudied, despite the increasing needs for more actionable mental health resources, especially among young people. Objective: We aimed to develop Bayesian machine learning classifiers as data-based decision aids for the assessment of the actionability of credible mental health information for people with mental health issues and diseases. Methods: We collected and classified creditable online health information on mental health issues into generic mental health (GEN) information and patient-specific (PAS) mental health information. GEN and PAS were both patient-oriented health resources developed by health authorities of mental health and public health promotion. GENs were non-classified online health information without indication of targeted readerships; PASs were developed purposefully for specific populations (young, elderly people, pregnant women, and men) as indicated by their website labels. To ensure the generalisability of our model, we chose to develop a sparse Bayesian machine learning classifier using Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). Results: Using optimisation and normalisation techniques, we developed a best-performing classifier through joint optimisation of natural language features and min-max normalisation of feature frequencies. The AUC (0.957), sensitivity (0.900), and specificity (0.953) of the best model were statistically higher (p < 0.05) than other models using parallel optimisation of structural and semantic features with or without feature normalisation. We subsequently evaluated the diagnostic utility of our model in the clinic by comparing its positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratios (LR−) and 95% confidence intervals (95% C.I.) as we adjusted the probability thresholds with the range of 0.1 and 0.9. We found that the best pair of LR+ (18.031, 95% C.I.: 10.992, 29.577) and LR− (0.100, 95% C.I.: 0.068, 0.148) was found when the probability threshold was set to 0.45 associated with a sensitivity of 0.905 (95%: 0.867, 0.942) and specificity of 0.950 (95% CI: 0.925, 0.975). These statistical properties of our model suggested its applicability in the clinic. Conclusion: Our study found that PAS had significant advantage over GEN mental health information regarding information actionability, engagement, and suitability for specific populations with distinct mental health issues. GEN is more suitable for general mental health information acquisition, whereas PAS can effectively engage patients and provide more effective and needed self-care support. The Bayesian machine learning classifier developed provided automatic tools to support decision making in the clinic to identify more actionable resources, effective to support self-care among different populations.",10.3390/ijerph181910048,3,Scopus,85115604791,2-s2.0-85115604791,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115604791
A Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Framework for Smart and Personalized Air Pollution Monitoring and Health Management in Hong Kong,Li V.O.K.,2021,Environmental Science and Policy,"All people in the world are entitled to enjoy a clean environment and a good quality of life. With big data and artificial intelligence technologies, it is possible to estimate personalized air pollution exposure and synchronize it with activity, health, quality of life and behavioural data, and provide real-time, personalized and interactive alert and advice to improve the health and well-being of individual citizens. In this paper, we propose an overarching framework outlining five major challenges to personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, and respective methodologies in an integrated interdisciplinary manner. First, urban air quality data is sparse, rendering it difficult to provide timely personalized alert and advice. Second, collected data, especially those involving human inputs such as health perception, are often missing and erroneous. Third, the data collected are heterogeneous, and highly complex, not easily comprehensible to facilitate individual and collective decision-making. Fourth, the causal relationships between personal air pollutants exposure (specifically, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>1.0</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf>) and personal health conditions, and health-related quality of life perception, of young asthmatics and young healthy citizens in Hong Kong (HK), are yet to be established. Fifth, whether personalized and smart information and advice provided can induce behavioural change and improve health and quality of life are yet to be determined. To overcome these challenges, our first novelty is to develop an AI and big data framework to estimate and forecast air quality in high temporal-spatial resolution and real-time. Our second novelty includes the deployment of mobile pollution sensor platforms to substantially improve the accuracy of estimated and forecasted air quality data, and the collection of activity, health condition and perception data. Our third novelty is the development of visualization tools and comprehensible indexes, by correlating personal exposure with four types of personal data, to provide timely, personalized pollution, health and travel alerts and advice. Our fourth novelty is determining causal relationship, if any, between personal pollutants, PM<inf>1.0</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf>, NO<inf>2</inf> exposure and personal health condition, and personal health perception, based on a clinical experiment of 150 young asthmatics and 150 young healthy citizens in HK. Our fifth novelty is an intervention study to determine if smart information, presented via our proposed visualized platform, will induce personal behavioural change. Our novel big data AI-driven approach, when integrated with other analytical approaches, provides an integrated interdisciplinary framework for personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, easily transferrable to and applicable in other domains and countries.",10.1016/j.envsci.2021.06.011,35,Scopus,85111282536,2-s2.0-85111282536,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111282536
App-Based Mindfulness Training for Adolescent Rumination: Predictors of Immediate and Cumulative Benefit,Webb C.A.,2021,Mindfulness,"Objectives: Rumination is a transdiagnostic risk factor for depression and anxiety, which surge during the adolescent years. Mindfulness training—with its emphasis on metacognitive awareness and present-moment attention—may be effective at reducing rumination. Mindfulness apps offer a convenient, engaging, and cost-effective means for accessing mindfulness training for teens. Despite their increasing popularity among adolescents, no study to date has investigated which teens are well-suited to app-based mindfulness training. Methods: Eighty adolescents (M age = 14.01 years, 45% girls) with elevated rumination were enrolled in a 3-week trial of app-based mindfulness training. Repeated daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys assessed problem-focused and emotion-focused rumination immediately prior to and following each mindfulness exercise. Elastic net regularization (ENR) models tested baseline predictors of “immediate” (post-mindfulness exercise) and “cumulative” (post-3-week intervention) benefit from app-based mindfulness training. Results: Ninety percent (72/80) of adolescents completed the 3-week trial, and the mean number of mindfulness exercises completed was 28.7. Baseline adolescent characteristics accounted for 14–25% of the variance in outcomes (i.e., reduction in problem-focused or emotion-focused rumination). Higher baseline rumination, and lower emotional suppression, predicted better immediate and cumulative outcomes. In contrast, female gender and older age predicted better immediate, but not cumulative, outcomes. Differences in results across outcome timeframes (immediate vs. cumulative) are discussed. Conclusions: Findings from this study highlight the potential of data-driven approaches to inform which adolescent characteristics may predict benefit from engaging with an app-based mindfulness training program. Additional research is needed to test these predictive models against a comparison (non-mindfulness) condition.",10.1007/s12671-021-01719-0,20,Scopus,85112097426,2-s2.0-85112097426,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112097426
The intervention of internet technology on students' english learning in the intelligent era,Su Z.,2021,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Objective: With the development of the Internet, Internet technology has had a great impact on English learning. This article explores the general expression of the performance, motivation and anxiety of students in Chinese medicine undergraduates in second language learning (SLL). performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates in China, it is to analyze the attribution and relationship of above three aspects, and propose the method of using artificial intelligence to improve students' learning motivation, reduce learning anxiety and improve learning ability. Methods: it is to select the undergraduate students (n = 300) in Jilin Province of China as the subjects. Use the Chinese version of the Foreign Language Learning Anxiety Scale under Internet technology, the Chinese Undergraduate English Learning Motivation Questionnaire, the self-made College Students' English learning ability evaluation scale and the English Writing Scale were used for test. Results: SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates are in the middle level among all undergraduates in China, and their English writing ability is lower than the middle level; Analysis of variance shows that there are significant differences in gender (p<0.01) and grade (p<0.05); learning ability in grade has extremely significant difference (p<0.01); female 's learning ability and writing ability were significantly higher than male's (p<0.01);Demographic variables were not statistically correlated with SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety (p>0.05); SLL anxiety had remarkable correlation with learning motivation (p>0.05); learning anxiety was statistically correlated with learning ability (p<0.01); learning motivation was negative correlative with learning ability (P<0.01). Regression analysis showed that learning anxiety and motivation had 44.3% and 5.8% explanatory power to English learning ability respectively. Intervention experiment results showed that Internet learning system significantly improved the performance of the experimental group (P<0.01), and the performance of the experimental group in listening, reading, writing and translation was significantly higher than that of the control group (p<0.01). the effectiveness of Internet learning mode had remarkable negative relationship with students' learning anxiety (P<0.01), and was significantly positive with learning motivation and learning ability (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Based on the data-driven theory, the empirical study of Internet learning system in English teaching is completed, which provides an important theoretical support for the current College English intelligent teaching in China, which also provides a strong argument for the ""scaffolding function""of AI in language learning. At the same time, the research also puts forward innovative ways to improve the effect of College English teaching from the perspective of psychology: through second language learning with AI resources, the ""challenging task""set by the intelligent learning system increases the intensity and difficulty of learning, thus arousing the ""promoting anxiety""of second language learners, and further internalizing the external and instrumental motivation in depth in order to improve English learning ability.",10.1145/3482632.3483015,2,Scopus,85120521138,2-s2.0-85120521138,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120521138
The Influence of Family Function on State Anxiety of Chinese College Students During the Epidemic of COVID-19,Yang L.,2021,Frontiers in Psychology,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may affect mental health. There is little research about the influence of family function on the state anxiety of college students in the context of the global pandemic. The study aimed to clarify that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and trait anxiety had mediating effects in family function on the state anxiety of Chinese college students following the “stay-at-home” order during the outbreak of COVID-19. This cross-sectional study was conducted online with 1,039 respondents. We analyzed demographics, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (ST-AI) and Chinese Family Function Scale (FAD-18), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and used path analysis to discuss the influence of family function on state and trait anxiety. The results showed that female students’ state and trait anxiety was higher than that of male students (P < 0.05). Medical students’ state and trait anxiety was lower than that of literature students (P < 0.05). The GAD of the male was lower compared with the female. The score of family function has significant differences in gender, age, education, and region (P < 0.05). Gender, family function, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and GAD relate to others (r = 0.07∼0.85, p < 0.05). The results of fit indices for measurement invariance models showed that the impact of family function among GAD, state and trait anxiety across gender is significantly different (each step p < 0.05). GAD and trait anxiety had a complete meditating effect between family function and state anxiety (the proportion of standard indirect mediating effect was 24.94% in females and 36.79% in males). A healthy family function may alleviate GAD and anxiety of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.",10.3389/fpsyg.2021.701945,13,Scopus,85116268773,2-s2.0-85116268773,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116268773
Digital Mental Health for Young People: A Scoping Review of Ethical Promises and Challenges,Wies B.,2021,Frontiers in Digital Health,"Mental health disorders are complex disorders of the nervous system characterized by a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. Mental illness is of particular concern for younger people. The WHO estimates that around 20% of the world's children and adolescents have a mental health condition, a rate that is almost double compared to the general population. One approach toward mitigating the medical and socio-economic effects of mental health disorders is leveraging the power of digital health technology to deploy assistive, preventative, and therapeutic solutions for people in need. We define “digital mental health” as any application of digital health technology for mental health assessment, support, prevention, and treatment. However, there is only limited evidence that digital mental health tools can be successfully implemented in clinical settings. Authors have pointed to a lack of technical and medical standards for digital mental health apps, personalized neurotechnology, and assistive cognitive technology as a possible cause of suboptimal adoption and implementation in the clinical setting. Further, ethical concerns have been raised related to insufficient effectiveness, lack of adequate clinical validation, and user-centered design as well as data privacy vulnerabilities of current digital mental health products. The aim of this paper is to report on a scoping review we conducted to capture and synthesize the growing literature on the promises and ethical challenges of digital mental health for young people aged 0–25. This review seeks to survey the scope and focus of the relevant literature, identify major benefits and opportunities of ethical significance (e.g., reducing suffering and improving well-being), and provide a comprehensive mapping of the emerging ethical challenges. Our findings provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current literature and offer a detailed informative basis for any stakeholder involved in the development, deployment, and management of ethically-aligned digital mental health solutions for young people.",10.3389/fdgth.2021.697072,135,Scopus,85123785156,2-s2.0-85123785156,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123785156
Efficacy of an mhealth intervention (brave) to promote mental wellness for american indian and alaska native teenagers and young adults: Randomized controlled trial,Rushing S.C.,2021,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Culturally relevant interventions are needed to help American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) teenagers and young adults navigate common risky situations involving family and friends, including drug and alcohol misuse, dating violence, and suicidality. Leveraging We R Native, a multimedia health resource for Native teenagers and young adults, staff of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board designed the BRAVE intervention for Native youth. The program is delivered via SMS text messaging and includes role model videos, mental wellness strategies, links to culturally relevant resources, and social support from family and friends. Objective: We aim to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the BRAVE intervention among AI/AN teenagers and young adults (aged 15-24 years) to assess its impact on their physical, mental, and spiritual health; their resilience and self-esteem; and their coping and help-seeking skills. Methods: From October to December 2019, we recruited 2334 AI/AN teenagers and young adults nationwide via social media channels and SMS text messages and enrolled 1044 participants. AI/AN teenagers and young adults enrolled in the study received either BRAVE SMS text messages, designed to improve mental health, help-seeking skills, and cultural resilience, or 8 weeks of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) SMS text messages, designed to elevate and reaffirm Native voices in STEM and medicine and then received the BRAVE SMS text messages. The impacts of the BRAVE intervention were tested using linear mixed-effect models and linear regressions. Results: A total of 833 AI/AN teenagers and young adults were included in the analysis. Individuals in the BRAVE and STEM arms showed significant positive trends over the course of the study for all outcomes, except cultural identity and help-seeking behavior. Mean scores were significantly different for health (P<.001), resilience (P<.001), negative coping (P=.03), positive coping (P<.001), self-efficacy (P=.02), and self-esteem (P<.001). Changes in help-seeking self-efficacy were significant in those exhibiting risky behaviors at baseline to exit (P=.01). Those who reported positive coping scores at baseline also reported better health on average; however, no difference was found in risky drug and alcohol use (P<.001). The number of participants who used SMS text messages to help themselves increased from 69.1% (427/618) at 3 months to 76% (381/501; P<.001) at 8 months. Similarly, the number of participants who used SMS text messages to help friends or family members increased from 22.4% (138/616) at 3 months to 54.6% (272/498) at 8 months. Conclusions: This is the first national randomized controlled trial of a mobile health intervention among AI/AN teenagers and young adults to test the efficacy of a mental wellness intervention in relation to STEM career messages. This study provides new insights for supporting the next generation of AI/AN changemakers. ,,.",10.2196/26158,22,Scopus,85116006508,2-s2.0-85116006508,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116006508
Patterns of high-risk drinking among medical students: A web-based survey with machine learning,Marcon G.,2021,Computers in Biology and Medicine,"Background: Prior studies have found increased rates of alcohol consumption among physicians and medical students. The present study aims to build machine learning (ML) models to identify patterns of high-risk drinking (HRD), including alcohol use disorder, within this population. Methods: We analyzed data collected through a web-based survey among Brazilian medical students. Variables included sociodemographic data, personal information, university status, and mental health. Stratification for HRD was carried out based on the AUDIT-C scores. Three ML algorithms were used to build classifiers to predict HRD among medical students: elastic net regularization, random forest, and artificial neural networks. Model interpretation techniques were adopted to assess the most influential predictors for models' decisions, which represent potential factors associated with HRD. Results: A total of 4840 medical students were included in the study. The prevalence of HRD was 53.03%. The three ML models built were able to distinguish individuals with HRD from low-risk drinking (LRD) with very similar performance. The average AUC scores in the cross-validation procedure were around 0.72, and this performance was replicated in the test set. The most important features for the ML models were the use of tobacco and cannabis, monthly family income, marital status, sexual orientation, and physical activities. Conclusions: This study proposes that ML models may serve as tools for initial screening of students regarding their susceptibility for at-risk drinking or alcohol use disorder. In addition, we identified several key factors associated with HRD that could be further investigated and explored for preventive and assistance measures.",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104747,11,Scopus,85114703940,2-s2.0-85114703940,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114703940
The food equity and environmental data sovereignty (feeds) project: Protocol for a quasi-experimental study evaluating a digital platform for climate change preparedness,Bhawra J.,2021,Jmir Research Protocols,"Background: Despite having the tools at our disposal to enable an adequate food supply for all people, inequities in food acquisition, distribution, and most importantly, food sovereignty, worsen food insecurity. The detrimental impact of climate change on food systems and mental health is further exacerbated by a lack of food sovereignty. We urgently require innovative solutions to enable food sovereignty, minimize food insecurity, and address climate change-related mental distress (ie, solastalgia). Indigenous communities have a wealth of Traditional Knowledge for climate change adaptation and preparedness to strengthen food systems. Traditional Knowledge combined with Western methods can revolutionize ethical data collection, engagement, and knowledge mobilization. Objective: The Food Equity and Environmental Data Sovereignty (FEEDS) Project takes a participatory action, citizen science approach for early detection and warning of climate change impacts on food sovereignty, food security, and solastalgia. The aim of this project is to develop and implement a sustainable digital platform that enables real-time decision-making to mitigate climate change-related impacts on food systems and mental well-being. Methods: Citizen science enables citizens to actively contribute to all aspects of the research process. The FEEDS Project is being implemented in five phases: participatory project planning, digital climate change platform customization, community-led evaluation, digital platform and project refinement, and integrated knowledge translation. The project is governed by a Citizen Scientist Advisory Council comprising Elders, Traditional Knowledge Keepers, key community decision makers, youth, and FEEDS Project researchers. The Council governs all phases of the project, including coconceptualizing a climate change platform, which consists of a smartphone app and a digital decision-making dashboard. Apart from capturing environmental and health-related big data (eg, weather, permafrost degradation, fire hazards, and human movement), the custom-built app uses artificial intelligence to engage and enable citizens to report on environmental hazards, changes in biodiversity or wildlife, and related food and mental health issues in their communities. The app provides citizens with valuable information to mitigate health-related risks and relays big data in real time to a digital dashboard. Results: This project is currently in phase 1, with the subarctic Métis jurisdiction of Île-à-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan, Canada. Conclusions: The FEEDS Project facilitates Indigenous Peoples' self-determination, governance, and data sovereignty. All citizen data are anonymous and encrypted, and communities have ownership, access, control, and possession of their data. The digital dashboard system provides decision makers with real-time data, thereby increasing the capacity to self-govern. The participatory action research approach, combined with digital citizen science, advances the cocreation of knowledge and multidisciplinary collaboration in the digital age. Given the urgency of climate change, leveraging technology provides communities with tools to respond to existing and emerging crises in a timely manner, as well as scientific evidence regarding the urgency of current health and environmental issues.",10.2196/31389,16,Scopus,85115610347,2-s2.0-85115610347,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115610347
Prevention of suicidal relapses in adolescents with a smartphone application: Bayesian network analysis of a preclinical trial using in silico patient simulations,Mouchabac S.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Recently, artificial intelligence technologies and machine learning methods have offered attractive prospects to design and manage crisis response processes, especially in suicide crisis management. In other domains, most algorithms are based on big data to help diagnose and suggest rational treatment options in medicine. But data in psychiatry are related to behavior and clinical evaluation. They are more heterogeneous, less objective, and incomplete compared to other fields of medicine. Consequently, the use of psychiatric clinical data may lead to less accurate and sometimes impossible-to-build algorithms and provide inefficient digital tools. In this case, the Bayesian network (BN) might be helpful and accurate when constructed from expert knowledge. Medical Companion is a government-funded smartphone application based on repeated questions posed to the subject and algorithm-matched advice to prevent relapse of suicide attempts within several months. Objective: Our paper aims to present our development of a BN algorithm as a medical device in accordance with the American Psychiatric Association digital healthcare guidelines and to provide results from a preclinical phase. Methods: The experts are psychiatrists working in university hospitals who are experienced and trained in managing suicidal crises. As recommended when building a BN, we divided the process into 2 tasks. Task 1 is structure determination, representing the qualitative part of the BN. The factors were chosen for their known and demonstrated link with suicidal risk in the literature (clinical, behavioral, and psychometrics) and therapeutic accuracy (advice). Task 2 is parameter elicitation, with the conditional probabilities corresponding to the quantitative part. The 4-step simulation (use case) process allowed us to ensure that the advice was adapted to the clinical states of patients and the context. Results: For task 1, in this formative part, we defined clinical questions related to the mental state of the patients, and we proposed specific factors related to the questions. Subsequently, we suggested specific advice related to the patient’s state. We obtained a structure for the BN with a graphical representation of causal relations between variables. For task 2, several runs of simulations confirmed the a priori model of experts regarding mental state, refining the precision of our model. Moreover, we noticed that the advice had the same distribution as the previous state and was clinically relevant. After 2 rounds of simulation, the experts found the exact match. Conclusions: BN is an efficient methodology to build an algorithm for a digital assistant dedicated to suicidal crisis management. Digital psychiatry is an emerging field, but it needs validation and testing before being used with patients. Similar to psychotropics, any medical device requires a phase II (preclinical) trial. With this method, we propose another step to respond to the American Psychiatric Association guidelines.

Automated Monitoring of Suicidal Adolescents' Digital Media Use: Qualitative Study Exploring Acceptability within Clinical Care,Biernesser C.,2021,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Monitoring linguistic cues from adolescents' digital media use (DMU; ie, digital content transmitted on the web, such as through text messages or social media) that could denote suicidal risk offers a unique opportunity to protect adolescents vulnerable to suicide, the second leading cause of death among youth. Adolescents communicate through digital media in high volumes and frequently express emotionality. In fact, web-based disclosures of suicidality are more common than in-person disclosures. The use of automated methods of digital media monitoring triggered by a natural language processing algorithm offers the potential to detect suicidal risk from subtle linguistic units (eg, negatively valanced words, phrases, or emoticons known to be associated with suicidality) present within adolescents' digital media content and to use this information to respond to alerts of suicidal risk. Critical to the implementation of such an approach is the consideration of its acceptability in the clinical care of adolescents at high risk of suicide. Objective: Through data collection among recently suicidal adolescents, parents, and clinicians, this study examines the current context of digital media monitoring for suicidal adolescents seeking clinical care to inform the need for automated monitoring and the factors that influence the acceptance of automated monitoring of suicidal adolescents'DMU within clinical care. Methods: A total of 15 recently suicidal adolescents (aged 13-17 years), 12 parents, and 10 clinicians participated in focus groups, qualitative interviews, and a group discussion, respectively. Data were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants described important challenges to the current strategies for monitoring the DMU of suicidal youth. They felt that automated monitoring would have advantages over current monitoring approaches, namely, by protecting web-based environments and aiding adolescent disclosure and support seeking about web-based suicidal risk communication, which may otherwise go unnoticed. However, they identified barriers that could impede implementation within clinical care, namely, adolescents' and parents' concerns about unintended consequences of automated monitoring, that is, the potential for loss of privacy or false alerts, and clinicians' concerns about liability to respond to alerts of suicidal risk. On the basis of the needs and preferences of adolescents, parents, and clinicians, a model for automated digital media monitoring is presented that aims to optimize acceptability within clinical care for suicidal youth. Conclusions: Automated digital media monitoring offers a promising means to augment detection and response to suicidal risk within the clinical care of suicidal youth when strategies that address the preferences of adolescents, parents, and clinicians are in place.",10.2196/26031,5,Scopus,85116055400,2-s2.0-85116055400,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116055400
Career Counseling Chatbot on Facebook Messenger using AI,Suresh N.,2021,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"Increasingly we observe that newly graduated university students struggle to find employment, often ending up in fields completely different from those that they studied in, and employees reporting low levels of satisfaction in the careers that they choose. One of the reasons for this could be a lack of adequate, useful career guidance when an individual is in university or recently graduated. Chatbots are useful resources and a topic of interest in the realm of Computer Science and AI for their ability to mimic experts in different applications, as well as being able to replicate human interaction to varying degrees. Research suggests that the use of a chatbot in offering career counseling can serve as an efficient means to provide this useful service in environments where a dedicated career counsellor may not be available. A lack of appropriate, adequate career counseling means youth may wind up pursuing careers that are chosen for them by their parents or only chosen for the promise of high salaries. These decisions may be made without taking into consideration whether or not they align with the individual's interests and values. This can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction in one's career, which is detrimental not only to the wellbeing of the individual but also to the overall productivity of the business in which they are hired. Hence, the development of the chatbot will better inform users, assisting them in the ways of choosing a career. This will allow them to consider careers they may not have thought available to them, that would be more fulfilling and satisfactory than one that does not align with their interests. This research adopted both Research methodology and Software Development methodology. Under Research Methodology, a survey was conducted to gather information about individuals' opinions regarding their possible career choices, and what types of career advice they would like to receive from the system. In addition, the latest research on career guidance was considered in forming the basis of the questions asked. This information was used in chatbot system development on the Facebook Messenger platform, using tools such as the Facebook SDK, the Messenger Platform APIs, and JavaScript, and the Wit.ai API which enables the use of Natural Language Processing, which is a use case of AI techniques. The chatbot understands user input and give relevant and appropriate responses, reliably and in real-time. In conclusion, the results obtained are hoped to result in positive proclivity towards adopting the system, thus serving as a useful asset to any universities or institutions that might wish to utilize it.",10.1145/3484824.3484875,20,Scopus,85123791935,2-s2.0-85123791935,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123791935
Applying Machine Learning Approaches to Suicide Prediction Using Healthcare Data: Overview and Future Directions,Boudreaux E.D.,2021,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Objective: Early identification of individuals who are at risk for suicide is crucial in supporting suicide prevention. Machine learning is emerging as a promising approach to support this objective. Machine learning is broadly defined as a set of mathematical models and computational algorithms designed to automatically learn complex patterns between predictors and outcomes from example data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. The model's performance continuously improves over time by learning from newly available data. Method: This concept paper explores how machine learning approaches applied to healthcare data obtained from electronic health records, including billing and claims data, can advance our ability to accurately predict future suicidal behavior. Results: We provide a general overview of machine learning concepts, summarize exemplar studies, describe continued challenges, and propose innovative research directions. Conclusion: Machine learning has potential for improving estimation of suicide risk, yet important challenges and opportunities remain. Further research can focus on incorporating evolving methods for addressing data imbalances, understanding factors that affect generalizability across samples and healthcare systems, expanding the richness of the data, leveraging newer machine learning approaches, and developing automatic learning systems.",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.707916,53,Scopus,85113156065,2-s2.0-85113156065,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113156065
Estimation of psychological distress in Japanese youth through narrative writing: Text-based stylometric and sentiment analyses,Manabe M.,2021,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Internalizing mental illnesses associated with psychological distress are often underdetected. Text-based detection using natural language processing (NLP) methods is increasingly being used to complement conventional detection efforts. However, these approaches often rely on self-disclosure through autobiographical narratives that may not always be possible, especially in the context of the collectivistic Japanese culture. Objective: We propose the use of narrative writing as an alternative resource for mental illness detection in youth. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the textual characteristics of narratives written by youth with psychological distress; our research focuses on the detection of psychopathological tendencies in written imaginative narratives. Methods: Using NLP tools such as stylometric measures and lexicon-based sentiment analysis, we examined short narratives from 52 Japanese youth (mean age 19.8 years, SD 3.1) obtained through crowdsourcing. Participants wrote a short narrative introduction to an imagined story before completing a questionnaire to quantify their tendencies toward psychological distress. Based on this score, participants were categorized into higher distress and lower distress groups. The written narratives were then analyzed using NLP tools and examined for between-group differences. Although outside the scope of this study, we also carried out a supplementary analysis of narratives written by adults using the same procedure. Results: Youth demonstrating higher tendencies toward psychological distress used significantly more positive (happiness-related) words, revealing differences in valence of the narrative content. No other significant differences were observed between the high and low distress groups. Conclusions: Youth with tendencies toward mental illness were found to write more positive stories that contained more happiness-related terms. These results may potentially have widespread implications on psychological distress screening on online platforms, particularly in cultures such as Japan that are not accustomed to self-disclosure. Although the mechanisms that we propose in explaining our results are speculative, we believe that this interpretation paves the way for future research in online surveillance and detection efforts.",10.2196/29500,10,Scopus,85112715458,2-s2.0-85112715458,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112715458
‘Routine’ versus ‘Smart Phone Application Based – Intense’ follow up of patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: Impact on clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction,Yadav S.,2021,Ijc Heart and Vasculature,"Background: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to the spectrum of clinical presentation of coronary artery disease (CAD). As a routine practice at our institute, following PCI, ACS patients are called for the first follow up after two weeks. This period of two weeks can be full of anxieties, concerns and medical issues. In this study, we planned to assess the feasibility/acceptability of smart phone application (app) based system for patient follow-up and its comparison to routine practice among patients with ACS who have undergone a PCI. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted over a period of one year from January to December 2017. After the PCI was deemed successful, patients were recruited and enrolled based on the understanding of basic English language and operation of a smart phone. Those who consented to be part of study were then randomly allocated either the conventional follow up group or the intense follow up (routine + smart phone app based follow up) group. First co- primary outcome was composite of clinical outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, target vessel revascularisation, heart failure admission and emergency visit). Second co- primary outcome was patient satisfaction. The overall patient satisfaction was assessed by the patients using a five-point patient satisfaction survey instrument containing five questions with 5 marks each, in which higher scores meant more satisfaction. Secondary outcome was controlled hypertension in hypertensive patients. It was defined as systolic BP less than 130 and diastolic BP less than 80 mmHg. Results: A cohort of 228 patients (109 in intense app-based arm; 119 in routine follow up arm) were analyzed. The result showed significant improvement in blood pressure control in hypertensive population in intense app based follow up group (76.2%) when compared to routine follow up group (45%) with p value 0.0062. The satisfaction score was significantly higher in the intense app based follow up (20.7 ± 1.29) as compared to routine follow up (16.5 ± 2.68); p value 0.0001. In the intense app based follow up 72.5% patient felt it was excellent tool (score 21–25) while 27.5% categorized it as good (score 16–20). While the routine follows up was perceived as good by most (91.6%) of the patients. Only 4.2% graded it as excellent and an equal number (4.2%) graded it as a poor way of follow up. Conclusions: App based system shows higher satisfaction rate and comparable clinical outcome when compared to traditional hospital based follow up protocol alone. It has a high acceptance rate and thus this system should be explored further to optimize long term patient care.",10.1016/j.ijcha.2021.100832,6,Scopus,85108602180,2-s2.0-85108602180,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108602180
Perceptions of alerts issued by social media platforms in response to self-injury posts among latinx adolescents: Qualitative analysis,Laestadius L.I.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: There is growing interest in using social media data to detect and address nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents. Adolescents often do not seek clinical help for NSSI and may adopt strategies to obscure detection; therefore, social media platforms may be able to facilitate early detection and treatment by using machine learning models to screen posts for harmful content and subsequently alert adults. However, such efforts have raised privacy and ethical concerns among health researchers. Little is currently known about how adolescents perceive these efforts. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine perceptions of automated alerts for NSSI posts on social media among Latinx adolescents, who are at risk for NSSI yet are underrepresented in both NSSI and health informatics research. In addition, we considered their perspectives on preferred recipients of automated alerts. Methods: We conducted semistructured, qualitative interviews with 42 Latinx adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 years who were recruited from a nonprofit organization serving the Latinx community in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Latinx population in Milwaukee is largely of Mexican descent. All interviews were conducted between June and July 2019. Transcripts were analyzed using framework analysis to discern their perceptions of automated alerts sent by social media platforms and potential alert recipients. Results: Participants felt that automated alerts would make adolescents safer and expedite aid before the situation escalated. However, some worried that hyperbolic statements would generate false alerts and instigate conflicts. Interviews revealed strong opinions about ideal alert recipients. Parents were most commonly endorsed, but support was conditional on perceptions that the parent would respond appropriately. Emergency services were judged as safer but inappropriate for situations considered lower risk. Alerts sent to school staff generated the strongest privacy concerns. Altogether, the preferred alert recipients varied by individual adolescents and perceived risks in the situation. None raised ethical concerns about the collection, analysis, or storage of personal information regarding their mental health status. Conclusions: Overall, Latinx adolescents expressed broad support for automated alerts for NSSI on social media, which indicates opportunities to address NSSI. However, these efforts should be co-constructed with adolescents to ensure that preferences and needs are met, as well as embedded within broader approaches for addressing structural and cultural barriers to care.",10.2196/28931,6,Scopus,85112582995,2-s2.0-85112582995,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112582995
Identifying predictors of university students’ wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic—a data-driven approach,Liu C.,2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed risks to public mental health worldwide. University students, who are already recognised as a vulnerable population, are at elevated risk of mental health issues given COVID-19-related disruptions to higher education. To assist universities in effectively allocating resources to the launch of targeted, population-level interventions, the cur-rent study aimed to uncover predictors of university students’ psychological wellbeing during the pandemic via a data-driven approach. Methods: Data were collected from 3973 Australian university students ((median age = 22, aged from 18 to 79); 70.6% female)) at five time points during 2020. Feature selection was conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify predictors from a comprehensive set of variables. Selected variables were then entered into an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to compare coefficients and assess statistical significance. Results: Six negative predictors of university students’ psychological wellbeing emerged: White/Eu-ropean ethnicity, restriction stress, perceived worry on mental health, dietary changes, perceived sufficiency of distancing communication, and social isolation. Physical health status, emotional sup-port, and resilience were positively associated with students’ psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has the largest effect on students’ psychological wellbeing. Notably, age, gender, international status, and educational level did not emerge as predictors of wellbeing. Conclusion: To cost-effec-tively support student wellbeing through 2021 and beyond, universities should consider investing in internet-and tele-based interventions explicitly targeting perceived social isolation among stu-dents. Course-based online forums as well as internet-and tele-based logotherapy may be promis-ing candidates for improving students’ psychological wellbeing.",10.3390/ijerph18136730,79,Scopus,85108206485,2-s2.0-85108206485,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108206485
College life is hard! - Shedding light on stress prediction for autistic college students using data-driven analysis,Islam T.Z.,2021,Proceedings 2021 IEEE 45th Annual Computers Software and Applications Conference Compsac 2021,"Autistic college students face significant challenges in college settings and have a higher dropout rate than neurotypical college students. High physiological distress, depression, and anxiety are identified as critical challenges that contribute to this less than optimal college experience. In this paper, we leverage affordable mobile and wearable devices to collect large amounts of physiological and contextual data (biomarkers) and leverage a data-driven analysis approach for building stress prediction models. Such models can be used to provide real-time intervention for better stress management. We conducted a mixed-method study where we collected physiological and contextual data from 20 college students (10 neurotypical and 10 autistic). Our proposed data-driven analysis pipeline leverages an unsupervised representation learning technique with a semi-supervised label approximation method to predict the onset of stress based on biomarkers for autistic students, neurotypical students, and both populations with accuracies 69%, 72%, and 70%, respectively.",10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00066,3,Scopus,85115864560,2-s2.0-85115864560,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115864560
"Understanding, Discovering, and Mitigating Habitual Smartphone Use in Young Adults",Roffarello A.M.,2021,ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems,"People, especially young adults, often use their smartphones out of habit: They compulsively browse social networks, check emails, and play video-games with little or no awareness at all. While previous studies analyzed this phenomena qualitatively, e.g., by showing that users perceive it as meaningless and addictive, yet our understanding of how to discover smartphone habits and mitigate their disruptive effects is limited. Being able to automatically assess habitual smartphone use, in particular, might have different applications, e.g., to design better ""digital wellbeing""solutions for mitigating meaningless habitual use. To close this gap, we first define a data analytic methodology based on clustering and association rules mining to automatically discover complex smartphone habits from mobile usage data. We assess the methodology over more than 130,000 phone usage sessions collected from users aged between 16 and 33, and we show evidence that smartphone habits of young adults can be characterized by various types of links between contextual situations and usage sessions, which are highly diversified and differently perceived across users. We then apply the proposed methodology in Socialize, a digital wellbeing app that (i) monitors habitual smartphone behaviors in real time and (ii) uses proactive notifications and just-in-time reminders to encourage users to avoid any identified smartphone habits they consider as meaningless. An in-the-wild study with 20 users (ages 19-31) demonstrates that Socialize can assist young adults in better controlling their smartphone usage with a significant reduction of their unwanted smartphone habits.",10.1145/3447991,28,Scopus,85111410776,2-s2.0-85111410776,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111410776
Impact of using e-learning tools on Student’s Psychological Health during covid-19,Das K.,2021,Vfast Transactions on Software Engineering,"COVID-19 is a disease generally caused by a virus called Coronavirus. The first corona case was reported in Wuhan, the City of China, which spread worldwide and led to global health emergencies as a pandemic. Under this situation, like many countries, the Pakistan educational system implements an electronic learning (e-learning) mode due to lockdown all over the country. However, during the implementation, it has been observed that the sudden application of the e-learning mode significantly disturbs the psychological health of students. In order to address this problem, the current research work initially led an online survey through a google form to gather a novel dataset to study the psychological effect of electronic tools specifically on UMT students' goodness. A dataset of 735 responses was recorded to predict students' depression, sleeping habits, social interaction, and academic performance using elearning tools. Further, the dataset was analyzed regarding each question's occurrences and proportions that were considered and tabulated. Secondly, multiple machine learning models such as Logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbours, and Support Vector Machine are considered to classify and deliberate the relationship between electronic learning and psychological illnesses. The experimental results showed that students' psychological health was significantly impacted due to the usage of e-learning tools during a pandemic. In future work, we will extend the scope of the proposed methodology to understand university students' emotional behaviour, psychological desires, and political inferring to improve electronic learning.",10.21015/vtse.v9i3.692,4,Scopus,105018762814,2-s2.0-105018762814,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105018762814
"Predicting depression from smartphone behavioral markers using machine learning methods, hyperparameter optimization, and feature importance analysis: Exploratory study",Asare K.O.,2021,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: Depression is a prevalent mental health challenge. Current depression assessment methods using self-reported and clinician-administered questionnaires have limitations. Instrumenting smartphones to passively and continuously collect moment-by-moment data sets to quantify human behaviors has the potential to augment current depression assessment methods for early diagnosis, scalable, and longitudinal monitoring of depression. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of predicting depression with human behaviors quantified from smartphone data sets, and to identify behaviors that can influence depression. Methods: Smartphone data sets and self-reported 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression assessments were collected from 629 participants in an exploratory longitudinal study over an average of 22.1 days (SD 17.90; range 8-86). We quantified 22 regularity, entropy, and SD behavioral markers from the smartphone data. We explored the relationship between the behavioral features and depression using correlation and bivariate linear mixed models (LMMs). We leveraged 5 supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms with hyperparameter optimization, nested cross-validation, and imbalanced data handling to predict depression. Finally, with the permutation importance method, we identified influential behavioral markers in predicting depression. Results: Of the 629 participants from at least 56 countries, 69 (10.97%) were females, 546 (86.8%) were males, and 14 (2.2%) were nonbinary. Participants’ age distribution is as follows: 73/629 (11.6%) were aged between 18 and 24, 204/629 (32.4%) were aged between 25 and 34, 156/629 (24.8%) were aged between 35 and 44, 166/629 (26.4%) were aged between 45 and 64, and 30/629 (4.8%) were aged 65 years and over. Of the 1374 PHQ-8 assessments, 1143 (83.19%) responses were nondepressed scores (PHQ-8 score <10), while 231 (16.81%) were depressed scores (PHQ-8 score ≥10), as identified based on PHQ-8 cut-off. A significant positive Pearson correlation was found between screen status–normalized entropy and depression (r=0.14, P<.001). LMM demonstrates an intraclass correlation of 0.7584 and a significant positive association between screen status–normalized entropy and depression (β=.48, P=.03). The best ML algorithms achieved the following metrics: precision, 85.55%-92.51%; recall, 92.19%-95.56%; F1, 88.73%-94.00%; area under the curve receiver operating characteristic, 94.69%-99.06%; Cohen κ, 86.61%-92.90%; and accuracy, 96.44%-98.14%. Including age group and gender as predictors improved the ML performances. Screen and internet connectivity features were the most influential in predicting depression. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that behavioral markers indicative of depression can be unobtrusively identified from smartphone sensors’ data. Traditional assessment of depression can be augmented with behavioral markers from smartphones for depression diagnosis and monitoring.",10.2196/26540,98,Scopus,85110364704,2-s2.0-85110364704,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110364704
Resting-state connectome-based support-vector-machine predictive modeling of internet gaming disorder,Song K.R.,2021,Addiction Biology,"Internet gaming disorder (IGD), a worldwide mental health issue, has been widely studied using neuroimaging techniques during the last decade. Although dysfunctions in resting-state functional connectivity have been reported in IGD, mapping relationships from abnormal connectivity patterns to behavioral measures have not been fully investigated. Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM)—a recently developed machine-learning approach—has been used to examine potential neural mechanisms in addictions and other psychiatric disorders. To identify the resting-state connections associated with IGD, we modified the CPM approach by replacing its core learning algorithm with a support vector machine. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired in 72 individuals with IGD and 41 healthy comparison participants. The modified CPM was conducted with respect to classification and regression. A comparison of whole-brain and network-based analyses showed that the default-mode network (DMN) is the most informative network in predicting IGD both in classification (individual identification accuracy = 78.76%) and regression (correspondence between predicted and actual psychometric scale score: r = 0.44, P < 0.001). To facilitate the characterization of the aberrant resting-state activity in the DMN, the identified networks have been mapped into a three-subsystem division of the DMN. Results suggest that individual differences in DMN function at rest could advance our understanding of IGD and variability in disorder etiology and intervention outcomes.",10.1111/adb.12969,28,Scopus,85092401617,2-s2.0-85092401617,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092401617
Assessing patient perceptions and experiences of Paracetamol in France: Infodemiology study using social media data mining,Schück S.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Individuals frequently turning to social media to discuss medical conditions and medication, sharing their experiences and information and asking questions among themselves. These online discussions can provide valuable insights into individual perceptions of medical treatment, and increasingly, studies are focusing on the potential use of this information to improve health care management. Objective: The objective of this infodemiology study was to identify social media posts mentioning paracetamol-containing products to develop a better understanding of patients’ opinions and perceptions of the drug. Methods: Posts between January 2003 and March 2019 containing at least one mention of paracetamol were extracted from 18 French forums in May 2019 with the use of the Detec’t (Kap Code) web crawler. Posts were then analyzed using the automated Detec’t tool, which uses machine learning and text mining methods to inspect social media posts and extract relevant content. Posts were classified into groups: Paracetamol Only, Paracetamol and Opioids, Paracetamol and Others, and the Aggregate group. Results: Overall, 44,283 posts were analyzed from 20,883 different users. Post volume over the study period showed a peak in activity between 2009 and 2012, as well as a spike in 2017 in the Aggregate group. The number of posts tended to be higher during winter each year. Posts were made predominantly by women (14,897/20,883, 71.34%), with 12.00% (2507/20,883) made by men and 16.67% (3479/20,883) by individuals of unknown gender. The mean age of web users was 39 (SD 19) years. In the Aggregate group, pain was the most common medical concept discussed (22,257/37,863, 58.78%), and paracetamol risk was the most common discussion topic, addressed in 20.36% (8902/43,725) of posts. Doliprane was the most common medication mentioned (14,058/44,283, 31.74%) within the Aggregate group, and tramadol was the most commonly mentioned drug in combination with paracetamol in the Aggregate group (1038/19,587, 5.30%). The most common unapproved indication mentioned within the Paracetamol Only group was fatigue (190/616, with 16.32% positive for an unapproved indication), with reference to dependence made by 1.61% (136/8470) of the web users, accounting for 1.33% (171/12,843) of the posts in the Paracetamol Only group. Dependence mentions in the Paracetamol and Opioids group were provided by 6.94% (248/3576) of web users, accounting for 5.44% (342/6281) of total posts. Reference to overdose was made by 245 web users across 291 posts within the Paracetamol Only group. The most common potential adverse event detected was nausea (306/12843, 2.38%) within the Paracetamol Only group. Conclusions: The use of social media mining with the Detec’t tool provided valuable information on the perceptions and understanding of the web users, highlighting areas where providing more information for the general public on paracetamol, as well as other medications, may be of benefit.",10.2196/25049,7,Scopus,85110355117,2-s2.0-85110355117,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110355117
IPonder: A Novel Approach to Multimodal Mental Health Diagnosis and Therapy for Teens via Deep Transfer Learning and Computer Vision,Kogilathota V.,2021,2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Robotics and Communication Icairc 2021,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death for teenagers, tarnishing the future potential of the world. More teenagers die from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, stroke, and many more diseases, combined. Although the greatest mental health improvement occurs from a conversation, over 50% of suicidal teenagers stay quiet about their depression due to shame. Thus, iPonder, a cross-platform accessible mobile application for teenagers to privately discuss, confront, and overcome their depression, was created. Using a four-level diagnosis approach based on user data, responses to psychological questionnaires, choice specification, and free-response answers, iPonder constructs a hyper-personalized user profile, which can then be used to pair teenagers anonymously online with similar profiles to discuss and vent about their issues. Questionnaires include the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator test. Using Reddit's Self-Reported Mental Health Diagnosis text-corpus with over 200,000 data points, 11 artificial neural networks were constructed to predict user risk of various mental illnesses based on their free-Text-responses, using transfer learning from a token-based text embedding neural network with over 48 million parameters trained on the English Google News 7B corpus with over 4 billion data points. Additionally, two other artificial neural networks were created, trained on the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus with tremendous labeled video data regarding facial landmark tracking and audio analysis for depression-diagnosed people, to predict the risk of depression from a user-submitted video. All neural networks were evaluated on their accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Besting state-of-The-Art metrics on similar tasks in the relevant literature, iPonder achieves over 95% accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score per neural network, pointing to a new age of accessible, effective, and anonymous mental health therapy in teens.",10.1109/ICAIRC52191.2021.9545055,2,Scopus,85116851351,2-s2.0-85116851351,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116851351

Based on a Decision Tree Model for Exploring the Risk Factors of Smartphone Addiction Among Children and Adolescents in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic,Duan L.,2021,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Smartphone addiction has emerged as a major concern among children and adolescents over the past few decades and may be heightened by the outbreak of COVID-19, posing a threat to their physical and mental health. Then we aimed to develop a decision tree model as a screening tool for unrecognized smartphone addiction by conducting large sample investigation in mainland China. Methods: The data from cross-sectional investigation of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents in mainland China (n = 3,615) was used to build models of smartphone addiction by employing logistic regression, visualized nomogram, and decision tree analysis. Results: Smartphone addiction was found in 849 (23.5%) of the 3,615 respondents. According to the results of logistic regression, nomogram, and decision tree analyses, Internet addiction, hours spend on smartphone during the epidemic, levels of clinical anxiety symptoms, fear of physical injury, and sex were used in predictive model of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents. The C-index of the final adjusted model of logistic regression was 0.804. The classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUC area of decision tree for detecting smartphone addiction were 87.3, 71.4, 92.1, 73.5, 91.4, and 0.884, respectively. Conclusions: It was found that the incidence of smartphone addiction among children and adolescents is significant during the epidemic.

Prediction of problematic smartphone use: A machine learning approach,Lee J.,2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"While smartphone addiction is becoming a recent concern with the exponential increase in the number of smartphone users, it is difficult to predict problematic smartphone users based on the usage characteristics of individual smartphone users. This study aimed to explore the possibility of predicting smartphone addiction level with mobile phone log data. By Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA), 29,712 respondents completed the Smartphone Addiction Scale developed in 2017. Integrating basic personal characteristics and smartphone usage information, the data were analyzed using machine learning techniques (decision tree, random forest, and Xgboost) in addition to hypothesis tests. In total, 27 variables were employed to predict smartphone addiction and the accuracy rate was the highest for the random forest (82.59%) model and the lowest for the decision tree model (74.56%). The results showed that users’ general information, such as age group, job classification, and sex did not contribute much to predicting their smartphone addiction level.

Personalized machine learning of depressed mood using wearables,Shah R.V.,2021,Translational Psychiatry,"Depression is a multifaceted illness with large interindividual variability in clinical response to treatment. In the era of digital medicine and precision therapeutics, new personalized treatment approaches are warranted for depression. Here, we use a combination of longitudinal ecological momentary assessments of depression, neurocognitive sampling synchronized with electroencephalography, and lifestyle data from wearables to generate individualized predictions of depressed mood over a 1-month time period. This study, thus, develops a systematic pipeline for N-of-1 personalized modeling of depression using multiple modalities of data. In the models, we integrate seven types of supervised machine learning (ML) approaches for each individual, including ensemble learning and regression-based methods. All models were verified using fourfold nested cross-validation. The best-fit as benchmarked by the lowest mean absolute percentage error, was obtained by a different type of ML model for each individual, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. The voting regressor, which is a composite strategy across ML models, was best performing on-average across subjects. However, the individually selected best-fit models still showed significantly less error than the voting regressor performance across subjects. For each individual’s best-fit personalized model, we further extracted top-feature predictors using Shapley statistics. Shapley values revealed distinct feature determinants of depression over time for each person ranging from co-morbid anxiety, to physical exercise, diet, momentary stress and breathing performance, sleep times, and neurocognition. In future, these personalized features can serve as targets for a personalized ML-guided, multimodal treatment strategy for depression.",10.1038/s41398-021-01445-0,76,Scopus,85107610835,2-s2.0-85107610835,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107610835
Machine learning analysis to identify digital behavioral phenotypes for engagement and health outcome efficacy of an mHealth intervention for obesity: Randomized controlled trial,Kim M.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: The digital health care community has been urged to enhance engagement and clinical outcomes by analyzing multidimensional digital phenotypes. Objective: This study aims to use a machine learning approach to investigate the performance of multivariate phenotypes in predicting the engagement rate and health outcomes of digital cognitive behavioral therapy. Methods: We leveraged both conventional phenotypes assessed by validated psychological questionnaires and multidimensional digital phenotypes within time-series data from a mobile app of 45 participants undergoing digital cognitive behavioral therapy for 8 weeks. We conducted a machine learning analysis to discriminate the important characteristics. Results: A higher engagement rate was associated with higher weight loss at 8 weeks (r=−0.59; P<.001) and 24 weeks (r=−0.52; P=.001). Applying the machine learning approach, lower self-esteem on the conventional phenotype and higher in-app motivational measures on digital phenotypes commonly accounted for both engagement and health outcomes. In addition, 16 types of digital phenotypes (ie, lower intake of high-calorie food and evening snacks and higher interaction frequency with mentors) predicted engagement rates (mean R<sup>2</sup> 0.416, SD 0.006). The prediction of short-term weight change (mean R<sup>2</sup> 0.382, SD 0.015) was associated with 13 different digital phenotypes (ie, lower intake of high-calorie food and carbohydrate and higher intake of low-calorie food). Finally, 8 measures of digital phenotypes (ie, lower intake of carbohydrate and evening snacks and higher motivation) were associated with a long-term weight change (mean R<sup>2</sup> 0.590, SD 0.011). Conclusions: Our findings successfully demonstrated how multiple psychological constructs, such as emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and motivational phenotypes, elucidate the mechanisms and clinical efficacy of a digital intervention using the machine learning method. Accordingly, our study designed an interpretable digital phenotype model, including multiple aspects of motivation before and during the intervention, predicting both engagement and clinical efficacy. This line of research may shed light on the development of advanced prevention and personalized digital therapeutics.",10.2196/27218,30,Scopus,85108838112,2-s2.0-85108838112,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108838112
B·RIGHT: usability and satisfaction with a mobile app for self-managing emotional crises in patients with borderline personality disorder,Frías Á.,2021,Australasian Psychiatry,"Objective: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental disorder characterized by emotional crises. To date, crisis interventions for BPD have been conducted via telephone calls and emergency units, which are associated with an extra amount of resources. The aim of this research was to test the usability and satisfaction with a psychotherapeutic mobile app for self-managing crises in BPD. Method: The B·RIGHT app was designed based on Artificial Intelligence psychotherapeutic algorithms. Usability and satisfaction with the app were assessed in 25 outpatients diagnosed with BPD (84% female, mean age = 35.80 years) using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and other questionnaires. Clinical features were assessed using the Borderline Symptom List, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and Beck’s Depression Inventory. Results: Patients with BPD considered the app user-friendly (mean total score = 4.03) and highly satisfactory (mean total score = 4.02), resulting in a positive user experience (mean total score = 4.09). Total usability was negatively associated with age (r = −.44), positively associated with educational level (rho =.47) and with overall emotion dysregulation (r =.51), and negatively associated with depression severity (r = −.47). Conclusions: The usability and satisfaction testing of the B·RIGHT app showed promising findings, which warrant further research in order to validate its effectiveness.",10.1177/1039856220924321,16,Scopus,85085009776,2-s2.0-85085009776,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085009776
Development of a positive body image chatbot (KIT) with young people and parents/carers: Qualitative focus group study,Beilharz F.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Body image and eating disorders represent a significant public health concern; however, many affected individuals never access appropriate treatment. Conversational agents or chatbots reflect a unique opportunity to target those affected online by providing psychoeducation and coping skills, thus filling the gap in service provision. Objective: A world-first body image chatbot called “KIT” was designed. The aim of this study was to assess preliminary acceptability and feasibility via the collection of qualitative feedback from young people and parents/carers regarding the content, structure, and design of the chatbot, in accordance with an agile methodology strategy. The chatbot was developed in collaboration with Australia’s national eating disorder support organization, the Butterfly Foundation. Methods: A conversation decision tree was designed that offered psychoeducational information on body image and eating disorders, as well as evidence-based coping strategies. A version of KIT was built as a research prototype to deliver these conversations. Six focus groups were conducted using online semistructured interviews to seek feedback on the KIT prototype. This included four groups of people seeking help for themselves (n=17; age 13-18 years) and two groups of parents/carers (n=8; age 46-57 years). Participants provided feedback on the cartoon chatbot character design, as well as the content, structure, and design of the chatbot webchat. Results: Thematic analyses identified the following three main themes from the six focus groups: (1) chatbot character and design, (2) content presentation, and (3) flow. Overall, the participants provided positive feedback regarding KIT, with both young people and parents/carers generally providing similar reflections. The participants approved of KIT’s character and engagement. Specific suggestions were made regarding the brevity and tone to increase KIT’s interactivity. Conclusions: Focus groups provided overall positive qualitative feedback regarding the content, structure, and design of the body image chatbot. Incorporating the feedback of lived experience from both individuals and parents/carers allowed the refinement of KIT in the development phase as per an iterative agile methodology. Further research is required to evaluate KIT’s efficacy.",10.2196/27807,64,Scopus,85108386605,2-s2.0-85108386605,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108386605
Medical insights from posts about irritable bowel syndrome by adolescent patients and their parents: Topic modeling and social network analysis,Zhong B.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are increasingly seeking and sharing information about their symptoms in web-based health care forums. Their posts and those from their parents contain critical insights that can be used by patients, physicians, and caregivers to manage IBS symptoms. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the posts from adolescent patients and their parents in a health forum, IBS Group, to better understand the key challenges, concerns, and issues of interest to young patients with IBS and their caregivers. Methods: Using topic modeling and social network analysis, in this study, we analyzed all the messages (over 750 topics and 3400 replies) posted on the IBS Group forum from 2010-2019 by adolescents with IBS aged 13-17 years and parents having children with IBS. We first detected 6 major topics in the posts by adolescent patients and parents on teenagers' IBS symptoms and the interaction between the topics. Social network analysis was then performed to gain insights into the nature of web-based interaction patterns among patients and caregivers. Results: Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and a latent Dirichlet allocation visualization tool, this study revealed 6 leading topics of concern in adolescents with IBS: school life, treatment or diet, symptoms, boys' ties to doctors, social or friend issues, and girls' ties to doctors. The top 6 topics in the parents' discussions were school life, girls' issues, boys' issues, diet choice, symptoms, and stress. The analyses show that the adolescent patients themselves are most concerned about the effect of IBS on their everyday activities and social lives. For parents having daughters with IBS, their top concerns were related to the girls' school performance and how much help they received at school. For their sons, the parents were more concerned about the pain and suffering that their sons had to endure. Both parents and adolescents gained social support from the web-based platform. Topic modeling shows that IBS affects teenagers the most in the areas of pain and school life. Furthermore, the issues raised by parents suggest that girls are bothered more by school performance over pain, whereas boys show exactly the opposite: pain is of greater concern than school performance. Conclusions: This study represents the first attempt to leverage both machine learning approaches and social network analysis to identify top IBS concerns from the perspectives of adolescent patients and caregivers in the same health forum. Young patients with IBS must face the challenges of social influences and anxiety associated with this health disorder in addition to physical pain and other symptoms. Boys and girls are affected differently by pain and school performance and view the IBS impacts differently from the parents.",10.2196/26867,7,Scopus,85107829569,2-s2.0-85107829569,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107829569
Detecting Suicide and Self-Harm Discussions Among Opioid Substance Users on Instagram Using Machine Learning,Purushothaman V.,2021,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"Background: Suicide and substance use disorder (SUD) pose serious public health challenges among young adults in the United States. Increasing social media use among these populations can be leveraged as an alternative method to detect characteristics of suicide-related topics and behavior among substance users. Objective: To detect and characterize suicide and self-harm related conversations co-occurring with SUD posts and comments on the popular social media platform Instagram. Methods: This study used big data and machine learning approaches to collect and classify Instagram posts containing 632 controlled substance-related hashtags. Posts were first classified for online drug diversion topics and then filtered to detect suicide and mental health discussions. Posts and comments were then manually annotated for SUD and mental health co-occurring themes. Associations between these characteristics were tested using the Chi-square test. Results: We detected 719 Instagram posts/comments that included user-generated discussions about suicide, substance use and/or mental health. Posts self-reporting SUD and mental health topics were also more likely to discuss suicide compared to those that did not discuss SUD and mental health topics, respectively (p < 0.001). Major themes observed included concurrent discussions of suicide ideation and attempts and low self-esteem. Conclusions: Our study results provide preliminary evidence of social media discussions about suicide and mental health among those with SUD. This co-occurrence represents a key health risk factor on a platform heavily utilized by young adults. Further studies are required to analyze specific patterns of suicide and self-harm ideations for the purposes of designing future suicide prevention campaigns through digital channels.",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.551296,9,Scopus,85107811577,2-s2.0-85107811577,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107811577
Prevalence of Medical Cannabis Use and Associated Health Conditions Documented in Electronic Health Records among Primary Care Patients in Washington State,Matson T.E.,2021,JAMA Network Open,"Importance: Many people use cannabis for medical reasons despite limited evidence of therapeutic benefit and potential risks. Little is known about medical practitioners' documentation of medical cannabis use or clinical characteristics of patients with documented medical cannabis use. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of past-year medical cannabis use documented in electronic health records (EHRs) and to describe patients with EHR-documented medical cannabis use, EHR-documented cannabis use without evidence of medical use (other cannabis use), and no EHR-documented cannabis use. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study assessed adult primary care patients who completed a cannabis screen during a visit between November 1, 2017, and October 31, 2018, at a large health system that conducts routine cannabis screening in a US state with legal medical and recreational cannabis use. Exposures: Three mutually exclusive categories of EHR-documented cannabis use (medical, other, and no use) based on practitioner documentation of medical cannabis use in the EHR and patient report of past-year cannabis use at screening. Main Outcomes and Measures: Health conditions for which cannabis use has potential benefits or risks were defined based on National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's review. The adjusted prevalence of conditions diagnosed in the prior year were estimated across 3 categories of EHR-documented cannabis use with logistic regression. Results: A total of 185565 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [18.1] years; 59% female, 73% White, 94% non-Hispanic, and 61% commercially insured) were screened for cannabis use in a primary care visit during the study period. Among these patients, 3551 (2%) had EHR-documented medical cannabis use, 36 599 (20%) had EHR-documented other cannabis use, and 145 415 (78%) had no documented cannabis use. Patients with medical cannabis use had a higher prevalence of health conditions for which cannabis has potential benefits (49.8%; 95% CI, 48.3%-51.3%) compared with patients with other cannabis use (39.9%; 95% CI, 39.4%-40.3%) or no cannabis use (40.0%; 95% CI, 39.8%-40.2%). In addition, patients with medical cannabis use had a higher prevalence of health conditions for which cannabis has potential risks (60.7%; 95% CI, 59.0%-62.3%) compared with patients with other cannabis use (50.5%; 95% CI, 50.0%-51.0%) or no cannabis use (42.7%; 95% CI, 42.4%-42.9%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, primary care patients with documented medical cannabis use had a high prevalence of health conditions for which cannabis use has potential benefits, yet a higher prevalence of conditions with potential risks from cannabis use. These findings suggest that practitioners should be prepared to discuss potential risks and benefits of cannabis use with patients.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.9375,29,Scopus,85105478947,2-s2.0-85105478947,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105478947
Engagement and effectiveness of a healthy-coping intervention via chatbot for university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Mixed methods proof-of-concept study,Gabrielli S.,2021,Jmir Mhealth and Uhealth,"Background: University students are increasingly reporting common mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and they frequently face barriers to seeking psychological support because of stigma, cost, and availability of mental health services. This issue is even more critical in the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via chatbots on mobile devices, offer the potential to achieve scalability of healthy-coping interventions by lowering cost and supporting prevention. Objective: The goal of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation measuring the engagement and effectiveness of Atena, a psychoeducational chatbot supporting healthy coping with stress and anxiety, among a population of university students. Methods: In a proof-of-concept study, 71 university students were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic; 68% (48/71) were female, they were all in their first year of university, and their mean age was 20.6 years (SD 2.4). Enrolled students were asked to use the Atena psychoeducational chatbot for 4 weeks (eight sessions; two per week), which provided healthy-coping strategies based on cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and mindfulness techniques. The intervention program consisted of conversations combined with audiovisual clips delivered via the Atena chatbot. Participants were asked to complete web-based versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and postintervention to assess effectiveness. They were also asked to complete the User Engagement Scale-Short Form at week 2 to assess engagement with the chatbot and to provide qualitative comments on their overall experience with Atena postintervention. Results: Participants engaged with the Atena chatbot an average of 78 (SD 24.8) times over the study period. A total of 61 out of 71 (86%) participants completed the first 2 weeks of the intervention and provided data on engagement (10/71, 14% attrition). A total of 41 participants out of 71 (58%) completed the full intervention and the postintervention questionnaires (30/71, 42% attrition). Results from the completer analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms for participants in more extreme GAD-7 score ranges (t<inf>39</inf>=0.94; P=.009) and a decrease in stress symptoms as measured by the PSS-10 (t39=2.00; P=.05) for all participants postintervention. Participants also improved significantly in the describing and nonjudging facets, based on their FFMQ subscale scores, and asked for some improvements in the user experience with the chatbot. Conclusions: This study shows the benefit of deploying a digital healthy-coping intervention via a chatbot to support university students experiencing higher levels of distress. While findings collected during the COVID-19 pandemic show promise, further research is required to confirm conclusions.",10.2196/27965,87,Scopus,85106947763,2-s2.0-85106947763,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106947763
Predictive model of social media and mobile phone’s problematic use: Impulsivity and social anxiety,Becerra-Guajardo J.R.,2021,Gaceta Medica De Caracas,"The number of social media and mobile phone users is constantly increasing. Researchers worldwide argue that studying the problematic use of these technologies is of the utmost importance to develop better interventions in the future. The study proposes a predictive model of problematic use of social media and mobile phones in relation to social anxiety the components of impulsivity and emotional regulation. A non-experimental, predictive, and correlational cross-sectional design was used to investigate the interaction between psychological variables. Through a convenience sampling, 242 university students aged 18 to 24 were selected (mean age = 20.29 SE = 2.19) to interact with relevant instruments.

Editors’ Note and Special Communication: Research Priorities in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Emerging From the COVID-19 Pandemic,Novins D.K.,2021,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Over the last year, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in profound disruptions across the globe, with school closures, social isolation, job loss, illness, and death affecting the lives of children and families in myriad ways. In an Editors' Note in our June 2020 issue,<sup>1</sup> our senior editorial team described this Journal's role in advancing knowledge in child and adolescent mental health during the pandemic and outlined areas we identified as important for science and practice in our field. Since then, the Journal has published articles on the impacts of the pandemic on child and adolescent mental health and service systems,<sup>2-5</sup> which are available in a special collection accessible through the Journal's website.<sup>6</sup> Alongside many opinion papers, the pace of publication of empirical research in this area is rapidly expanding, covering important issues such as increased frequency of mental health symptoms among children and adolescents<sup>3,5,7-10</sup> and changes in patterns of clinical service use such as emergency department visits.<sup>11-14</sup> As the Senior Editors prepared that Editors’ Note, they were acutely aware that the priorities that they identified were broad and generated by only a small group of scientists and clinicians. Although this had the advantage of enabling us to get this information out to readers quickly, we decided that a more systematic approach to developing recommendations for research priorities would be of greater long-term value. We were particularly influenced by the efforts of the partnership between the UK Academy of Medical Scientists and a UK mental health research charity (MQ: Transforming Mental Health) to detail COVID-19−related research priorities for “Mental Health Science” that was published online by Holmes et al. in The Lancet Psychiatry in April 2020.<sup>15</sup> Consistent with its focus on mental health research across the lifespan, several recommendations highlighted child development and children's mental health. However, a more detailed assessment of research priorities related to child and adolescent mental health was beyond the scope of that paper. Furthermore, the publication of that position paper preceded the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25, 2020, which re-energized efforts to acknowledge and to address racism and healthcare disparities in the United States and many other countries. To build upon the JAACAP Editors’ Note<sup>1</sup> and the work of Holmes et al.,<sup>15</sup> we conducted an international survey of professionals—practitioners and researchers—working on child and adolescent development and pediatric mental health to identify concerns about the impact of the pandemic on children, adolescents, and their families, as well as what is helping families navigate these impacts, and the specific research topics that are of greatest importance.",10.1016/j.jaac.2021.03.005,19,Scopus,85104961839,2-s2.0-85104961839,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104961839

Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on College Students After School Reopening: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on Machine Learning,Ren Z.,2021,Frontiers in Psychology,"COVID-19, the most severe public health problem to occur in the past 10 years, has greatly impacted people's mental health. Colleges in China have reopened, and how to prevent college students from suffering secondary damage due to school reopening remains elusive. This cross-sectional study was aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of COVID-19 after school reopening and explore via machine learning the factors that influence anxiety and depression among students. Among the 478 valid online questionnaires collected between September 14th and September 20th, 74 (15.5%) showed symptoms of anxiety (by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), and 155 (32.4%) showed symptoms of depression (by Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Descriptive analysis of basic personal characteristics indicated that students at a higher grade, having relatives or friends who have been infected, fearing being infected, and having a pessimistic attitude to COVID-19 easily experience anxiety or depression. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was utilized to counteract the imbalance of retrieved data. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and multivariate logistic regression were performed to explore significant influence factors. The results indicate that exercise frequency, alcohol use, school reopening, having relatives or friends who have been infected, self-quarantine, quarantine of classmates, taking temperature routinely, wearing masks routinely, sleep quality, retaining holiday, availability of package delivery, take-out availability, lockdown restriction, several areas in school closed due to COVID-19, living conditions in the school, taking the final examinations after school reopening, and the degree to which family economic status is influenced by COVID-19 are the primary influence factors for anxiety or depression. To evaluate the effect of our model, we used 5-fold cross-validation, and the average area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of anxiety and depression on the test set reached 0.885 and 0.806, respectively. To conclude, we examined the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese college students after school reopening and explored many factors influencing students' mental health, providing reasonable school management suggestions.",10.3389/fpsyg.2021.641806,99,Scopus,85105953395,2-s2.0-85105953395,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105953395

Impact of big data analytics on people's health: Overview of systematic reviews and recommendations for future studies,Do Nascimento I.J.B.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Although the potential of big data analytics for health care is well recognized, evidence is lacking on its effects on public health. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the use of big data analytics on people's health based on the health indicators and core priorities in the World Health Organization (WHO) General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the European Programme of Work (EPW), approved and adopted by its Member States, in addition to SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Furthermore, we sought to identify the most relevant challenges and opportunities of these tools with respect to people's health. Methods: Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Epistemonikos) were searched from the inception date to September 21, 2020. Systematic reviews assessing the effects of big data analytics on health indicators were included. Two authors independently performed screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) checklist. Results: The literature search initially yielded 185 records, 35 of which met the inclusion criteria, involving more than 5,000,000 patients. Most of the included studies used patient data collected from electronic health records, hospital information systems, private patient databases, and imaging datasets, and involved the use of big data analytics for noncommunicable diseases. ""Probability of dying from any of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes or chronic renal disease"" and ""suicide mortality rate"" were the most commonly assessed health indicators and core priorities within the WHO General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the EPW 2020/2025. Big data analytics have shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis and prediction of complications of diabetes mellitus as well as for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders; prediction of suicide attempts and behaviors; and the diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of important clinical outcomes of several chronic diseases. Confidence in the results was rated as ""critically low"" for 25 reviews, as ""low"" for 7 reviews, and as ""moderate"" for 3 reviews. The most frequently identified challenges were establishment of a well-designed and structured data source, and a secure, transparent, and standardized database for patient data. Conclusions: Although the overall quality of included studies was limited, big data analytics has shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis of certain diseases, improvement in managing chronic diseases, and support for prompt and real-time analyses of large sets of varied input data to diagnose and predict disease outcomes.",10.2196/27275,68,Scopus,85104054422,2-s2.0-85104054422,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104054422
Learning the mental health impact of COVID-19 in the United States with explainable artificial intelligence: Observational study,Jha I.P.,2021,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health, economic, and social fabric of many nations worldwide. Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Objective: This study is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this study, we have used a survey of 17,764 adults in the United States from different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis and Bayesian network inference, we have identified key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches led to effective modeling of the level of mental health prevalence. Results: Overall, females were more stressed than males, and people in the age group 18-29 years were more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian network model, we found that people with a chronic mental illness were more prone to mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new realities of working from home; homeschooling; and lack of communication with family, friends, and neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during the COVID-19–generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised machine learning models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy. Conclusions: Multiple factors such as social isolation, digital communication, and working and schooling from home were identified as factors of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular in-person communication with friends and family, a healthy social life, and social security were key factors, and taking care of people with a history of mental disease appears to be even more important during this time.",10.2196/25097,42,Scopus,85104823640,2-s2.0-85104823640,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104823640
Variation in sexual orientation documentation in a national electronic health record system,Lynch K.E.,2021,Lgbt Health,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine variation in sexual minority (SM) sexual orientation documentation within the electronic medical records of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Methods: Documentation of SM sexual orientation was retrospectively extracted from clinical notes and administrative data in the VHA from October 1, 1999 to July 1, 2019. The rate of documentation overall and by calendar year was calculated, and differences across patient, provider, and clinic characteristics were evaluated. Results: Approximately 1.4% of all VHA Veterans (n = 115,911) had at least one documentation of SM sexual orientation, including 79,455 men and 36,456 women. The rate of documentation increased from 81.01/100,000 in 2000 to 568.84/100,000 in 2018. The majority of documentations (58.7%) occurred in mental health settings by non-MD mental health/social work counselors, whereas only 9.6% occurred in primary care settings. Although 99% of these Veterans had a primary care visit, only 19% had SM status recorded in that setting. Conclusion: Documentation patterns of SM sexual orientation varied considerably in the VHA with notable gaps in primary care. Diverse approaches to culturally competent training for primary care clinicians and patient-facing collection strategies could facilitate documentation of sexual orientation.",10.1089/lgbt.2020.0333,22,Scopus,85104400251,2-s2.0-85104400251,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104400251
"Cyberbullying Detection, Based on the FastText and Word Similarity Schemes",Wang K.,2021,ACM Transactions on Asian and Low Resource Language Information Processing,"With recent developments in online social networks (OSNs), these services are widely applied in daily lives. On the other hand, cyberbullying, which is a relatively new type of harassment through the internet-based electronic devices, is rising in online social networks. Accordingly, scholars are attracted to investigating cyberbullying behaviors. Studies show that cyberbullying has a devastating effect on mental health, especially for teenagers. In order to reduce or even stop cyberbullying, different machine learning techniques are applied and numerous studies have been conducted so far. However, conventional detection schemes still have challenges, such as low accuracy. Therefore, it is of significant importance to find an efficient detection solution in the natural language processing and machine learning communities. In the present study, characteristics of cyberbullying are initially analyzed from vocabulary and syntax points of view. Then a new detection algorithm is proposed based on FastText and word similarity schemes. Finally, experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method. Obtained results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the detection accuracy and recall rate of cyberbullying detection.",10.1145/3398191,20,Scopus,85104186090,2-s2.0-85104186090,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104186090
Using machine learning analyses of speech to classify levels of expressed emotion in parents of youth with mood disorders,Weintraub M.J.,2021,Journal of Psychiatric Research,"Expressed emotion (EE), a measure of attitudes among caregivers towards a patient with a psychiatric disorder, is a robust predictor of relapse across mood and psychotic disorders. Because the measurement of EE is time-intensive and costly, its use in clinical settings has been limited. In an effort to automate EE classification, we evaluated whether machine learning (ML) applied to lexical features of speech samples can accurately categorize parents as high or low in EE and in its subtypes (criticism, overinvolvement, and warmth). The sample was 123 parents of youth who had active mood symptoms and a family history of bipolar disorder. Using ML algorithms, we achieved 75.2–81.8% accuracy (sensitivities of ~0.7 and specificities of ~0.8) in classifying parents as high or low in EE and EE subtypes. Additionally, machine-derived EE classifications and observer-rated EE classifications had simiar relationships with youth mood symptoms, parental distress, and family conflict. Of note, criticism related to greater manic severity, parental distress, and family conflict. Study findings indicate that EE classification can be automated through lexical analysis and suggest potential for facilitating larger-scale applications in clinical settings. The results also provide initial indications of the digital phenotypes that underlie EE and its subtypes.",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.019,11,Scopus,85100415443,2-s2.0-85100415443,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100415443
Using machine learning imputed outcomes to assess drug-dependent risk of self-harm in patients with bipolar disorder: A comparative effectiveness study,Nestsiarovich A.,2021,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: Incomplete suicidality coding in administrative claims data is a known obstacle for observational studies. With most of the negative outcomes missing from the data, it is challenging to assess the evidence on treatment strategies for the prevention of self-harm in bipolar disorder (BD), including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. There are conflicting data from studies on the drug-dependent risk of self-harm, and there is major uncertainty regarding the preventive effect of monotherapy and drug combinations. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare all commonly used BD pharmacotherapies, as well as psychotherapy for the risk of self-harm, in a large population of commercially insured individuals, using self-harm imputation to overcome the known limitations of this outcome being underrecorded within US electronic health care records. Methods: The IBM MarketScan administrative claims database was used to compare self-harm risk in patients with BD following 65 drug regimens and drug-free periods. Probable but uncoded self-harm events were imputed via machine learning, with different probability thresholds examined in a sensitivity analysis. Comparators included lithium, mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants (MSAs), second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), and five classes of antidepressants. Cox regression models with time-varying covariates were built for individual treatment regimens and for any pharmacotherapy with or without psychosocial interventions (“psychotherapy”). Results: Among 529,359 patients, 1.66% (n=8813 events) had imputed and/or coded self-harm following the exposure of interest. A higher self-harm risk was observed during adolescence. After multiple testing adjustment (P≤.012), the following six regimens had higher risk of self-harm than lithium: tri/tetracyclic antidepressants + SGA, FGA + MSA, FGA, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) + SGA, lithium + MSA, and lithium + SGA (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.44-2.29), and the following nine had lower risk: lamotrigine, valproate, risperidone, aripiprazole, SNRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), “no drug,” bupropion, and bupropion + SSRI (HRs 0.28-0.74). Psychotherapy alone (without medication) had a lower self-harm risk than no treatment (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.52-0.60; P=8.76×10<sup>-58</sup>). The sensitivity analysis showed that the direction of drug-outcome associations did not change as a function of the self-harm probability threshold. Conclusions: Our data support evidence on the effectiveness of antidepressants, MSAs, and psychotherapy for self-harm prevention in BD.",10.2196/24522,5,Scopus,85104866468,2-s2.0-85104866468,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104866468
One More Bite? Inferring Food Consumption Level of College Students Using Smartphone Sensing and Self-Reports,Meegahapola L.,2021,Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies,"While the characterization of food consumption level has been extensively studied in nutrition and psychology research, advancements in passive smartphone sensing have not been fully utilized to complement mobile food diaries in characterizing food consumption levels. In this study, a new dataset regarding the holistic food consumption behavior of 84 college students in Mexico was collected using a mobile application combining passive smartphone sensing and self-reports. We show that factors such as sociability and activity types and levels have an association to food consumption levels. Finally, we define and assess a novel ubicomp task, by using machine learning techniques to infer self-perceived food consumption level (eating as usual, overeating, undereating) with an accuracy of 87.81% in a 3-class classification task by using passive smartphone sensing and self-report data. Furthermore, we show that an accuracy of 83.49% can be achieved for the same classification task by using only smartphone sensing data and time of eating, which is an encouraging step towards building context-aware mobile food diaries and making food diary based apps less tedious for users.",10.1145/3448120,32,Scopus,85103680840,2-s2.0-85103680840,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103680840
Leveraging Collaborative-Filtering for Personalized Behavior Modeling,Xu X.,2021,Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies,"The prevalence of mobile phones and wearable devices enables the passive capturing and modeling of human behavior at an unprecedented resolution and scale. Past research has demonstrated the capability of mobile sensing to model aspects of physical health, mental health, education, and work performance, etc. However, most of the algorithms and models proposed in previous work follow a one-size-fits-all (i.e., population modeling) approach that looks for common behaviors amongst all users, disregarding the fact that individuals can behave very differently, resulting in reduced model performance. Further, black-box models are often used that do not allow for interpretability and human behavior understanding. We present a new method to address the problems of personalized behavior classification and interpretability, and apply it to depression detection among college students. Inspired by the idea of collaborative-filtering, our method is a type of memory-based learning algorithm. It leverages the relevance of mobile-sensed behavior features among individuals to calculate personalized relevance weights, which are used to impute missing data and select features according to a specific modeling goal (e.g., whether the student has depressive symptoms) in different time epochs, i.e., times of the day and days of the week. It then compiles features from epochs using majority voting to obtain the final prediction. We apply our algorithm on a depression detection dataset collected from first-year college students with low data-missing rates and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning model by 5.1% in accuracy and 5.5% in F1 score. We further verify the pipeline-level generalizability of our approach by achieving similar results on a second dataset, with an average improvement of 3.4% across performance metrics. Beyond achieving better classification performance, our novel approach is further able to generate personalized interpretations of the models for each individual. These interpretations are supported by existing depression-related literature and can potentially inspire automated and personalized depression intervention design in the future.",10.1145/3448107,56,Scopus,85103663635,2-s2.0-85103663635,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103663635
An ensemble learning approach for the detection of depression and mental illness over twitter data,Prakash A.,2021,Proceedings of the 2021 8th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development Indiacom 2021,"Depression and mental illness are becoming an indispensable concern, primarily among the youth. According to doctors, about 80 to 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. The close correspondence between social media platforms and their users helps in getting insight into the users' personal life on many levels. This project aims to analyze the tweets for self-assessed depressive features, which can make it possible for individuals, parents, caregivers, and medical professionals to combat this disorder. The project helps to identify the linguistic features of the tweets and the behavioral pattern of the Twitter users who post them, which could demonstrate symptoms of depression. This can be considered as an enhancement in the health care industry providing aid in the early detection and treatment of depression.

Predicting mental health of scholars using contextual word embedding,Chaurasia A.,2021,Proceedings of the 2021 8th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development Indiacom 2021,"Frustration, anger and mental fatigue are some of the most prevalent issues faced by scholars these days which are often due to the cut-throat competition and peer pressure among adolescents increasing day by day. The objective of the work was to predict the mental health of scholars by tracking strongly negative words or offensive slangs used very deliberately by them in their tweets. The data to analyze the sentiments exhibited by them has been used from their Twitter timelines. The most common topics they talked about and the common keywords for each of these topics were identified and thereafter using BERT, the word embedding and cosine similarities had been found between these keywords and a bag of words that contained a number of strongly negative emotion words collected manually. In this paper, contextual word embedding has been done on the twitter data of frustrated individuals to analyze their temperament and behavior exhibited by them. Also, we have found if there was any correlation between frequently used negative words and frustrated individuals or not.

A Novel BrainHealth Index Prototype Improved by Telehealth-Delivered Training During COVID-19,Chapman S.B.,2021,Frontiers in Public Health,"Introduction: Brain health is neglected in public health, receiving attention after something goes wrong. Neuroplasticity research illustrates that preventive steps strengthen the brain's component systems; however, this information is not widely known. Actionable steps are needed to scale proven population-level interventions. Objectives: This pilot tested two main objectives: (1) the feasibility/ease of use of an online platform to measure brain health, deliver training, and offer virtual coaching to healthy adults and (2) to develop a data driven index of brain health. Methods: 180 participants, ages 18–87, enrolled in this 12-week pilot. Participants took a BrainHealth Index™ (BHI), a composite of assessments encompassing cognition, well-being, daily-life and social, pre-post training. Participants engaged in online training with three coaching sessions. We assessed changes in BHI, effects of training utilization and demographics, contributions of sub-domain measures to the BHI and development of a factor analytic structure of latent BrainHealth constructs. Results: The results indicated that 75% of participants showed at least a 5-point gain on their BHI which did not depend on age, education, or gender. The contribution to these gains were from all sub-domains, including stress, anxiety and resilience, even though training focused largely on cognition. Some individuals improved due to increased resilience and decreased anxiety, whereas others improved due to increased innovation and social engagement. Larger gains depended on module utilization, especially strategy training. An exploratory factor analytic solution to the correlation matrix of online assessments identified three latent constructs. Discussion/Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of an online platform to assess changes on a composite BrainHealth Index and efficacy in delivering training modules and coaching. We found that adults, college age to late life, were motivated to learn about their brain and engage in virtual-training with coaching to improve their brain health. This effort intends to scale up to thousands, thus the pilot data, tested by an impending imaging pilot, will be utilized in ongoing machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop a precision brain health model. This pilot is a first step in scaling evidence-based brain health protocols to reach individuals and positively affect public health globally.",10.3389/fpubh.2021.641754,20,Scopus,85103422111,2-s2.0-85103422111,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103422111
Using Natural Language Processing on Electronic Health Records to Enhance Detection and Prediction of Psychosis Risk,Irving J.,2021,Schizophrenia Bulletin,"Background: Using novel data mining methods such as natural language processing (NLP) on electronic health records (EHRs) for screening and detecting individuals at risk for psychosis. Method: The study included all patients receiving a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust between January 1, 2008, and July 28, 2018. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-regularized Cox regression was used to refine and externally validate a refined version of a five-item individualized, transdiagnostic, clinically based risk calculator previously developed (Harrell's C = 0.79) and piloted for implementation. The refined version included 14 additional NLP-predictors: tearfulness, poor appetite, weight loss, insomnia, cannabis, cocaine, guilt, irritability, delusions, hopelessness, disturbed sleep, poor insight, agitation, and paranoia. Results: A total of 92 151 patients with a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the SLaM Trust were included in the derivation (n = 28 297) or external validation (n = 63 854) data sets. Mean age was 33.6 years, 50.7% were women, and 67.0% were of white race/ethnicity. Mean follow-up was 1590 days. The overall 6-year risk of psychosis in secondary mental health care was 3.4 (95% CI, 3.3-3.6). External validation indicated strong performance on unseen data (Harrell's C 0.85, 95% CI 0.84-0.86), an increase of 0.06 from the original model. Conclusions: Using NLP on EHRs can considerably enhance the prognostic accuracy of psychosis risk calculators.

Digital technologies and coercion in psychiatry,Morris N.P.,2021,Psychiatric Services,"Psychiatry has a contentious history of coercion in the care of patients with mental illness, and legal frameworks often govern use of coercive interventions, such as involuntary hospitalization, physical restraints, and medication over objection. Research also suggests that informal coercion, including subtle inducements, leverage, or threats, is prevalent and influential in psychiatric settings. Digital technologies bring promise for expanding access to psychiatric care and improving delivery of these services; however, use and misuse of digital technologies, such as electronic medical record flags, surveillance cameras, videoconferencing, and risk assessment tools, could lead to unexpected coercion of patients with mental illness. Using several composite case examples, the author proposes that the integration of digital technologies into psychiatric care can influence patients' experiences of coercion and provides recommendations for studying and addressing these effects.",10.1176/APPI.PS.202000427,5,Scopus,85102403911,2-s2.0-85102403911,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102403911
Ecological momentary assessment of depressive symptoms using the mind.me application: Convergence with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),McIntyre R.S.,2021,Journal of Psychiatric Research,"Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for mental disorders, using application-based (app) technology capable of passive and ambient data collection, has been insufficiently evaluated and validated with rigorous, adequately-powered, high-quality studies. Herein, we sought to validate the mind.me application for the assessment of depressive symptoms in adults. Adults (ages 18–65) who self-identified as having clinically significant depressive symptoms [i.e. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) ≥ 5] utilized the mind.me app—a mobile phone technology that collects data passively and continuously, and is capable of integrating broad multimodal data [e.g., location variance (e.g. GPS), behavioural (e.g. social network activity), and communication data (e.g. SMS texting, phone calls)]. The primary outcome was predictive accuracy (i.e. convergent validity with depressive symptom measurement, as captured by the PHQ-9). 200 subjects were enrolled in the study (mean age 46 ± 12.71). The average PHQ-9 score was 12.8 ± 6.9. The predictive accuracy of the mind.me app was 0.91 ± 0.06. The sensitivity was 0.98 and the specificity was 0.93. The mind.me app was rated by 200 users as highly usable and informative to their illness.

Evidence of gender differences in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 patients: An analysis of electronic health records using natural language processing and machine learning,Ancochea J.,2021,Journal of Women S Health,"Background: The impact of sex and gender in the incidence and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. Here, we aim to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, who were on average 1.5 years younger than male patients (61.7 ± 19.4 vs. 63.3 ± 18.3, p = 0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 15-59-year-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (95% confidence interval) observed in the 30-39-year-old range (1.69; 1.35-2.11). Upon diagnosis, headache, anosmia, and ageusia were significantly more frequent in females than males. Imaging by chest X-ray or blood tests were performed less frequently in females (65.5% vs. 78.3% and 49.5% vs. 63.7%, respectively), all p < 0.001. Regarding hospital resource use, females showed less frequency of hospitalization (44.3% vs. 62.0%) and intensive care unit admission (2.8% vs. 6.3%) than males, all p < 0.001.

Voice-based conversational agents for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions: Systematic literature review,Bérubé C.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Chronic and mental health conditions are increasingly prevalent worldwide. As devices in our everyday lives offer more and more voice-based self-service, voice-based conversational agents (VCAs) have the potential to support the prevention and management of these conditions in a scalable manner. However, evidence on VCAs dedicated to the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions is unclear. Objective: This study provides a better understanding of the current methods used in the evaluation of health interventions for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions delivered through VCAs. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We included primary research involving the prevention or management of chronic or mental health conditions through a VCA and reporting an empirical evaluation of the system either in terms of system accuracy, technology acceptance, or both. A total of 2 independent reviewers conducted the screening and data extraction, and agreement between them was measured using Cohen kappa. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the selected records. Results: Of 7170 prescreened papers, 12 met the inclusion criteria. All studies were nonexperimental. The VCAs provided behavioral support (n=5), health monitoring services (n=3), or both (n=4). The interventions were delivered via smartphones (n=5), tablets (n=2), or smart speakers (n=3). In 2 cases, no device was specified. A total of 3 VCAs targeted cancer, whereas 2 VCAs targeted diabetes and heart failure. The other VCAs targeted hearing impairment, asthma, Parkinson disease, dementia, autism, intellectual disability, and depression. The majority of the studies (n=7) assessed technology acceptance, but only few studies (n=3) used validated instruments. Half of the studies (n=6) reported either performance measures on speech recognition or on the ability of VCAs to respond to health-related queries. Only a minority of the studies (n=2) reported behavioral measures or a measure of attitudes toward intervention-targeted health behavior. Moreover, only a minority of studies (n=4) reported controlling for participants' previous experience with technology. Finally, risk bias varied markedly. Conclusions: The heterogeneity in the methods, the limited number of studies identified, and the high risk of bias show that research on VCAs for chronic and mental health conditions is still in its infancy. Although the results of system accuracy and technology acceptance are encouraging, there is still a need to establish more conclusive evidence on the efficacy of VCAs for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions, both in absolute terms and in comparison with standard health care.",10.2196/25933,92,Scopus,85103554360,2-s2.0-85103554360,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103554360
Improved mental health clinical practice informed by digital phenotyping,Bougeard A.,2021,Sante Mentale Au Quebec,"Objectives This review is motivated by the observation that clinical decision-making in mental health is limited by the nature of the measures obtained in conventional clinical interviews and the difficulty for clinicians to make accurate predictions about their patients’ future mental states. Our objective is to offer a representative overview of the potential of digital phenotyping coupled with machine learning to address this limitation, while highlighting its own current weaknesses. Methods Through a non-systematic narrative review of the literature, we identify the technological developments that make it possible to quantify, moment by moment and in ecologically valid settings, the human phenotype in various psychiatric populations using the smartphone. Relevant work is also selected in order to determine the usefulness and limitations of machine learning to guide predictions and clinical decision-making. Finally, the literature is explored to assess current barriers to the adoption of such tools. Results Although emerging from a recent field of research, a large body of work already highlights the value of measurements extracted from smartphone sensors in characterizing the human phenotype in behavioral, cognitive, emotional and social spheres that are all impacted by mental disorders. Machine learning permits useful and accurate clinical predictions based on such measures, but suffers from a lack of interpretability that will hamper its use in clinical practice in the near future. Moreover, several barriers identified both on the patient and clinician sides currently hamper the adoption of this type of monitoring and clinical decision support tools.

Insights into the real-life experiences of people living with epilepsy: A qualitative netnographic study,Fazekas B.,2021,Epilepsy and Behavior,"A qualitative netnographic study of epilepsy conversations posted on public social media sites over a 12-month period was conducted in order to identify key themes and issues for people living with epilepsy (PWE). A total of 264,706 conversations posted online between 03 November 2018 and 03 November 2019, which had originated in the UK, Spain, France, Italy, and Germany, were identified using pre-defined and piloted search terms. A random sample of these posts was then analyzed using natural language processing, and qualitative in-depth and contextual analysis. Key themes that emerged related to: disease awareness among the general public; the psychological and physical impact of seizures; the importance of ensuring proper sleep; understanding disease burden through time; finding treatment and managing side effects; and dealing with depression and anxiety. People living with epilepsy highlighted that seizures have a significant impact on mental as well as physical health and can cause limitations to all aspects of life. Fear of having a seizure in public is a major concern for PWE and the anticipation of seizures can worsen anxiety, causing patients to limit social interaction and often leading to social isolation, which may further exacerbate anxiety and depression. People living with epilepsy therefore advocate that greater attention be paid to the mental health impact of epilepsy. Treatment and its side effects were also a major aspect of the online conversation of PWE. Some PWE believe there is a lack of awareness or sensitivity among healthcare professionals, who may underestimate their concerns or not take sufficient time to discuss their needs. These findings therefore help sign-post issues of importance to PWE and areas in which their care may be improved.",10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107729,33,Scopus,85099631090,2-s2.0-85099631090,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099631090
Psychiatric rehabilitation through teaching smartphone skills to improve functional outcomes in serious mental illness,Rodriguez-Villa E.,2021,Internet Interventions,"This study measured the impact of a digital competencies and skills course on participants with serious mental illness. Close to 75% of participants reported an improvement in a smartphone related skill, and the majority of participants that reported improvement in one skill reported improvement in at least one other. Qualitative feedback from participants suggests how digital competencies acquired were used to immediately support functional outcomes. Objective: To improve functional outcomes in patients with serious mental illness through a multi-session curriculum designed to improve smartphone skills and engage participants in group learning and problem solving, targeting negative and cognitive symptoms of illness. Methods: An eight-week smartphone digital competencies and skills course was offered to two distinct groups of youth with serious mental illness. Pre and post self-report measurements were captured for each participant for each session. Results: Group participation varied by session, but overall 28 unique patients attended. From survey results, 75% reported improvement in smartphone related skills because of the groups. Qualitative feedback suggests how skills acquired by patients were immediately utilized to gain insight into health and support functional outcomes. Conclusions and implications for practice: Smartphone skills groups are a means to provide practical psychiatric rehabilitation that may enable some patients to compensate for cognitive and social deficits due to illness. While ensuring groups are responsive to patients with varying degrees of skills remains a challenge, adapting lesson structures and mediums, as well as creating new measurement tools, offers a means to modify the course with the clinical need.",10.1016/j.invent.2021.100366,14,Scopus,85100023499,2-s2.0-85100023499,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100023499

Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a web-based behavioural lifestyle programme for emPOWERment in early Multiple Sclerosis (POWER@MS1),Krause N.,2021,BMJ Open,"Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects young adults. Uncertainty is a major psychological burden of the disease from diagnosis to prognosis, enhanced by the pressure to make early decisions on a diverse set of immunotherapies. Watchful waiting for 1-2 years while adapting goals and lifestyle habits to life with a chronic disease represents another reasonable option for persons with MS (PwMS). A behaviour change programme based on evidence-based patient information (EBPI) is not available in standard care. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an embedded process evaluation investigates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based behavioural lifestyle programme to change lifestyle behaviour and reduce inflammatory disease activity in PwMS. Methods and analysis A web-based behavioural intervention will be evaluated in an RCT aiming to recruit 328 persons with clinically isolated syndrome, suspected MS or confirmed MS for less than 1 year, who have not yet started immunotherapy. Moreover, a mixed-methods process evaluation and a health economic evaluation will be carried out. Participants will be recruited in at least 16 MS centres across Germany and randomised to an intervention group with 12 months of access to EBPI about lifestyle factors in MS, combined with a complex behaviour change programme or to a control group (optimised standard care). The combined primary endpoint is the incidence of new T2 lesions on MRI or confirmed relapses. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians (PV6015). Trial results will be communicated at scientific conferences and meetings and presented on relevant patient websites and in patient education seminars.

Serving children and adolescents in need during the covid-19 pandemic: Evaluation of service-learning subjects with and without face-to-face interaction,Lin L.,2021,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has posed a great challenge to teaching and learning activities in higher education, particularly for service-learning subjects that involve inten-sive human interaction. Although service-learning may be transformed to a virtual mode in response to the pandemic, little is known about the impact of this new mode on student learning and well-being. This paper reports a university credit-bearing service-learning subject that involves services toward needy children and adolescents in a non-face-to-face mode under COVID-19 pan-demic. We examined the effectiveness of this subject by comparing it with the same subject deliv-ered via a face-to-face mode. Objective outcome evaluation via a pretest-posttest comparison (N = 216) showed that the students who took service-learning subjects with and without face-to-face interaction showed similar positive changes in positive youth development competences, service leadership qualities, and life satisfaction. Subjective outcome evaluation (N = 345) also showed that most students were satisfied with the subject, instructors and benefits regardless of the service mode. The findings highlight the important role of non-face-to-face service learning in promoting college students’ positive growth and well-being.",10.3390/ijerph18042114,50,Scopus,85101070655,2-s2.0-85101070655,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101070655
Machine Learning to Differentiate Risk of Suicide Attempt and Self-harm after General Medical Hospitalization of Women with Mental Illness,Edgcomb J.B.,2021,Medical Care,"Background:Suicide prevention is a public health priority, but risk factors for suicide after medical hospitalization remain understudied. This problem is critical for women, for whom suicide rates in the United States are disproportionately increasing.Objective:To differentiate the risk of suicide attempt and self-harm following general medical hospitalization among women with depression, bipolar disorder, and chronic psychosis.Methods:We developed a machine learning algorithm that identified risk factors of suicide attempt and self-harm after general hospitalization using electronic health record data from 1628 women in the University of California Los Angeles Integrated Clinical and Research Data Repository. To assess replicability, we applied the algorithm to a larger sample of 140,848 women in the New York City Clinical Data Research Network.Results:The classification tree algorithm identified risk groups in University of California Los Angeles Integrated Clinical and Research Data Repository (area under the curve 0.73, sensitivity 73.4, specificity 84.1, accuracy 0.84), and predictor combinations characterizing key risk groups were replicated in New York City Clinical Data Research Network (area under the curve 0.71, sensitivity 83.3, specificity 82.2, and accuracy 0.84). Predictors included medical comorbidity, history of pregnancy-related mental illness, age, and history of suicide-related behavior. Women with antecedent medical illness and history of pregnancy-related mental illness were at high risk (6.9%-17.2% readmitted for suicide-related behavior), as were women below 55 years old without antecedent medical illness (4.0%-7.5% readmitted).Conclusions:Prevention of suicide attempt and self-harm among women following acute medical illness may be improved by screening for sex-specific predictors including perinatal mental health history.",10.1097/MLR.0000000000001467,23,Scopus,85099997764,2-s2.0-85099997764,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099997764
Patients’ preferences for artificial intelligence applications versus clinicians in disease diagnosis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in China: Discrete choice experiment,Liu T.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Misdiagnosis, arbitrary charges, annoying queues, and clinic waiting times among others are long-standing phenomena in the medical industry across the world. These factors can contribute to patient anxiety about misdiagnosis by clinicians. However, with the increasing growth in use of big data in biomedical and health care communities, the performance of artificial intelligence (Al) techniques of diagnosis is improving and can help avoid medical practice errors, including under the current circumstance of COVID-19. Objective: This study aims to visualize and measure patients’ heterogeneous preferences from various angles of AI diagnosis versus clinicians in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. We also aim to illustrate the different decision-making factors of the latent class of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and prospects for the application of AI techniques in judgment and management during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 and in the future. Methods: A DCE approach was the main analysis method applied in this paper. Attributes from different dimensions were hypothesized: diagnostic method, outpatient waiting time, diagnosis time, accuracy, follow-up after diagnosis, and diagnostic expense. After that, a questionnaire is formed. With collected data from the DCE questionnaire, we apply Sawtooth software to construct a generalized multinomial logit (GMNL) model, mixed logit model, and latent class model with the data sets. Moreover, we calculate the variables’ coefficients, standard error, P value, and odds ratio (OR) and form a utility report to present the importance and weighted percentage of attributes. Results: A total of 55.8% of the respondents (428 out of 767) opted for AI diagnosis regardless of the description of the clinicians. In the GMNL model, we found that people prefer the 100% accuracy level the most (OR 4.548, 95% CI 4.048-5.110, P<.001). For the latent class model, the most acceptable model consists of 3 latent classes of respondents. The attributes with the most substantial effects and highest percentage weights are the accuracy (39.29% in general) and expense of diagnosis (21.69% in general), especially the preferences for the diagnosis “accuracy” attribute, which is constant across classes. For class 1 and class 3, people prefer the AI + clinicians method (class 1: OR 1.247, 95% CI 1.036-1.463, P<.001; class 3: OR 1.958, 95% CI 1.769-2.167, P<.001). For class 2, people prefer the AI method (OR 1.546, 95% CI 0.883-2.707, P=.37). The OR of levels of attributes increases with the increase of accuracy across all classes. Conclusions: Latent class analysis was prominent and useful in quantifying preferences for attributes of diagnosis choice. People’s preferences for the “accuracy” and “diagnostic expenses” attributes are palpable. AI will have a potential market. However, accuracy and diagnosis expenses need to be taken into consideration.",10.2196/22841,19,Scopus,85101884257,2-s2.0-85101884257,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101884257
Co-developing a Mental Health and Wellbeing Chatbot With and for Young People,Grové C.,2021,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"There are many young people who experience mental health and wellbeing challenges. A potential negative mental health trigger for some youth is a struggle to cope with stress at school, feelings of depression and anxiety and availability of adequate help for these stressors. In response to youth needs a mental health and wellbeing Chatbot has been co-developed with youth, technology partners and expert stakeholders. An element of the Chatbot is powered by artificial intelligence and rules based AI using natural language processing. It is created to communicate evidence based resources, wellbeing support, educational mental health information and adaptive coping strategies. This paper will discuss how the Chatbot has been developed, highlighting its participatory, co-design process with youth who are the key stakeholders to benefit from this digital tool. Research from interviews and surveys informed the creation of the Chabots personality and its character design. Examples of the conversation design and content development are provided. The paper finishes with how, if at all, digital tools such as Chatbot applications could support the mental health of young people in secondary schools or health care settings in conjunction with the wellbeing or health care team, concluding with lessons learned and cautions.",10.3389/fpsyt.2020.606041,88,Scopus,85100836972,2-s2.0-85100836972,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100836972
Suitability of text-based communications for the delivery of psychological therapeutic services to rural and remote communities: Scoping review,Dwyer A.,2021,Jmir Mental Health,"Background: People living in rural and remote areas have poorer access to mental health services than those living in cities. They are also less likely to seek help because of self-stigma and entrenched stoic beliefs about help seeking as a sign of weakness. E-mental health services can span great distances to reach those in need and offer a degree of privacy and anonymity exceeding that of traditional face-to-face counseling and open up possibilities for identifying at-risk individuals for targeted intervention. Objective: This scoping review maps the research that has explored text-based e-mental health counseling services and studies that have used language use patterns to predict mental health status. In doing so, one of the aims was to determine whether text-based counseling services have the potential to circumvent the barriers faced by clients in rural and remote communities using technology and whether text-based communications, in particular, can be used to identify individuals at risk of psychological distress or self-harm. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science databases for articles published in English through November 2020. Results: Of the 9134 articles screened, 70 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that text-based, real-time communication with a qualified therapist is an effective form of e-mental health service delivery, particularly for individuals concerned with stigma and confidentiality. There is also converging evidence that text-based communications that have been analyzed using computational linguistic techniques can be used to accurately predict progress during treatment and identify individuals at risk of serious mental health conditions and suicide. Conclusions: This review reveals a clear need for intensified research into the extent to which text-based counseling (and predictive models using modern computational linguistics tools) may help deliver mental health treatments to underserved groups such as regional communities, identify at-risk individuals for targeted intervention, and predict progress during treatment. Such approaches have implications for policy development to improve intervention accessibility in at-risk and underserved populations.",10.2196/19478,21,Scopus,85101875439,2-s2.0-85101875439,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101875439
Telehealth in type 1 diabetes,Kompala T.,2021,Current Opinion in Endocrinology Diabetes and Obesity,"Purpose of review The role of telehealth in the care of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has expanded dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic, and is expected to remain a major care delivery modality going forward. This review explores the landscape of recent evidence for telehealth in T1D care. Recent findings Telemedicine for routine T1D care has shown equivalence to standard in-person care, with respect to glycemic control, while also increasing access, convenience, and satisfaction. Telehealth use promotes increased engagement of adolescents with T1D. Telehealth platforms have successfully been used in the care of microvascular complications and to support mental health related to diabetes. Machine learning and advanced decision support will increasingly be used to augment T1D care, as recent evidence suggests increasing capabilities to improve glycemic control. A spectrum of digital connected care services are emerging to support people with diabetes with daily management of diabetes. Finally, policy and systems are required that promote data interoperability, telemedicine provision, and reimbursement to support the ongoing growth of telehealth in T1D. Summary A developing field of evidence supports use of telehealth in T1D. As this care modality scales, it has the potential to increase access to high-quality diabetes care for many people with T1D.",10.1097/MED.0000000000000600,28,Scopus,85099172329,2-s2.0-85099172329,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099172329
The aberrant behavioral spectrum of internet addiction in university students,Liu J.,2021,2021 10th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology Iceit 2021,"A large number of behaviors, collected by self-reporting questionnaires, have been demonstrated associative with Internet addiction (IA). Assume that these behaviors are informative for distinguishing IA subjects from normal controls (NCs). Rather than analyzing each behavior separately, a classification model is presented for discriminant analysis of behaviors jointly at a subject level. In conjunction with support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a forward behavior selection technique is presented to select behaviors for constructing the most discriminative behavioral spectrum. The discriminant analysis model has been applied to 8 types of behaviors based on IA study with 27 IA subjects and 27 NCs. These 8 types of behaviors were average online days per week, average online time per day, anxiety level, depression level, self-control ability, positive self-confidence, negative self-confidence, and self-confidence, which were closely associated with AI. Experimental results indicated that the aberrant behavioral spectrum were properly arranged, which identified behavioral markers with different levels of importance for IA. The presented classification model also achieved an excellent performance for differentiating IA subjects from NCs (average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]: 0.96, average accuracy: 84%, average specificity: 92%, average sensitivity: 76%).",10.1109/ICEIT51700.2021.9375548,1,Scopus,85103436866,2-s2.0-85103436866,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103436866

Research on Information Anxiety of College Students under the Background of Information Overloaded Based on Support Vector Machine Optimization Alogrithm,Jia Y.,2021,Proceedings 2021 2nd International Conference on Information Science and Education Icise Ie 2021,"With the continuous improvement of Internet technology, people have entered an era of continuous soaring knowledge and information. This era has brought infinite opportunities and challenges. People are exposed to a lot of information every day, such as the numerous information from Tic Toe and Weibo. However, the ability of receiving information of each person is limited. When the amount of received information exceeds his or her ability, information anxiety will arise. If things keep going like this, information anxiety will have a negative impact on the life and study of the college students. Meanwhile, Support Vector Machine (SVM) as one of the machine learning methods is of importance in statistical learning technology Because of its high efficiency, good performance and wide applications in classification, forecasting, and estimation, the SVM has become the most recognized method in learning machines. Therefore, this paper applies the Support Vector Machine optimization algorithm in Matlab language to quantify the relationship between the amount of information received and degree of information anxiety, seeking to find a balance point to help students learn more efficient Through the study of questionnaires, we find the three factors that cause college students information anxiety. We take these three as the independent variables, and the degree of information anxiety as the dependent variable. By the SVM alogrithm, the model between information anxiety, and the amount of information received is created. Then we can calculate the balance point. This paper also analyses the reaction of college students when they are exposed to a large amount of overloaded information, and the main behaviors of information anxiety. As for how to cope with the information anxiety, the redundant information is filtered through optimization algorithms model in order to provide students with effective information.

User Perception on an Artificial Intelligence Counseling App,Joo H.,2021,Lecture Notes in Computer Science Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics,"Mental health is a serious issue amongst college students in the Republic of Korea. The stigma related to mental health issues renders college students to be reluctant when it comes to seeking help regarding it. Moreover, college students often seek alternative means to rely on rather than in-person counseling sessions due to shortage of time, money, and lack of access to resources. Existing research has revealed that the utilization of technology can be conducive when it comes to alleviating mental health concerns. The development of a mobile application that provides its users with a counseling session via Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be a helpful resource for college students as it could be accessed regardless of the time and location of the students that wish to access the service.

A support system for formal college students: A case study of a community-based app augmented with a chatbot,Alqaidi S.,2021,2021 19th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training Ithet 2021,"The rapid adoption and advancement of technology has improved communication methods in many facets of life, including education. The affordance of an effective virtual communication channel can support college students' sense of belonging and mitigate their anxiety, which in turn can help them reach their maximum academic potential and greater well-being. In this study, we explored the common problems faced by college students - in particular, students enrolled in the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology at King Abdulaziz University - when they seek help, ask questions, or find out about current and upcoming events in the college. Moreover, we explored their knowledge of chatbots and their perceived effectiveness in answering frequently asked questions. The results revealed 1) the absence of a single platform that helps them communicate and share mutual benefits in an effective, easy, and fast manner, and 2) that less than half of the surveyed participants had previously interacted with a chatbot. Thus, the paper presents the development of a unified communication channel by building a mobile application that brings college students together to communicate and exchange common experiences and interests while being supported by a digital assistant technology (chatbot), which can answer common questions and inquiries. Users in a pilot test showed a high satisfaction level with the app.",10.1109/ITHET50392.2021.9759796,6,Scopus,85130091876,2-s2.0-85130091876,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130091876
Assessing COVID-19 impacts on college students via automated processing of free-form text,Sharma R.,2021,Healthinf 2021 14th International Conference on Health Informatics Part of the 14th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies Biostec 2021,"In this paper, we report experimental results on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on college students by processing free-form texts generated by them. By free-form texts, we mean textual entries posted by college students (enrolled in a four year US college) via an app specifically designed to assess and improve their mental health. Using a dataset comprising of more than 9000 textual entries from 1451 students collected over four months (split between pre and post COVID-19), and established NLP techniques, a) we assess how topics of most interest to student change between pre and post COVID-19, and b) we assess the sentiments that students exhibit in each topic between pre and post COVID-19. Our analysis reveals that topics like Education became noticeably less important to students post COVID-19, while Health became much more trending. We also found that across all topics, negative sentiment among students post COVID-19 was much higher compared to pre-COVID-19. We expect our study to have an impact on policy-makers in higher education across several spectra, including college administrators, teachers, parents, and mental health counselors.",,2,Scopus,85103840473,2-s2.0-85103840473,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103840473
Designing the Empathetic Research IoT Network (ERIN) Chatbot for Mental Health Resources,Persons B.,2021,Lecture Notes in Computer Science Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics,"Grounded in the user experience driven innovation (UXDI) framework, we designed and developed a chatbot, ERIN, to help college students with finding resources about sensitive issues such as mental health and Title IX. ERIN was designed to be accessed via different devices. Throughout the design process, the analysis of user interviews suggested that the service experience of the chatbot and its adoption may strongly be influenced by the medium through which it is accessed. To test this possibility, we conducted an experiment comparing user reactions to the chatbot using two different devices: laptop and smart phone. The preliminary results showed that user experience of the chatbot was almost significantly better in the mobile group and people in that group were almost significantly more likely to adopt the chatbot. These results and their implications are discussed.",10.1007/978-3-030-77750-0_41,6,Scopus,85112213519,2-s2.0-85112213519,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112213519
Understanding Health and Behavioral Trends of Successful Students Through Machine Learning Models,Kim A.,2021,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"This study analyzes patterns of physical, mental, lifestyle, and personality factors in college students in different periods over the course of a semester and models their relationships with students’ academic performance. The data analyzed was collected through smartphones and Fitbit. The use of machine learning models derived from the gathered data was employed to observe the extent of students’ behavior associated with their GPA, lifestyle, physical health, mental health, and personality attributes. A mutual agreement method was used in which rather than looking at the accuracy of results, the model parameters and weights of features were used to find common behavioral trends. From the results of the model creation, it was determined that the most significant indicator of academic success defined as a higher GPA, was the places a student spent their time. Lifestyle and personality factors were deemed more significant than mental and physical factors. This study will provide insight into the impact of different factors and the timing of those factors on students’ academic performance.",10.1007/978-3-030-74009-2_66,0,Scopus,85105877124,2-s2.0-85105877124,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105877124
Detecting depression and predicting its onset using longitudinal symptoms captured by passive sensing: A machine learning approach with robust feature selection,Chikersal P.,2021,ACM Transactions on Computer Human Interaction,"We present a machine learning approach that uses data from smartphones and fitness trackers of 138 college students to identify students that experienced depressive symptoms at the end of the semester and students whose depressive symptoms worsened over the semester. Our novel approach is a feature extraction technique that allows us to select meaningful features indicative of depressive symptoms from longitudinal data. It allows us to detect the presence of post-semester depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 85.7% and change in symptom severity with an accuracy of 85.4%. It also predicts these outcomes with an accuracy of >80%, 11-15 weeks before the end of the semester, allowing ample time for pre-emptive interventions.

Influence of Entrepreneur Awe on Entrepreneurship Management in the Internet Environment,Zhao G.,2021,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"With the rapid development of Internet technology, many traditional lifestyles and education have undergone fundamental changes. At the same time, Internet technology has lowered the threshold of entrepreneurship. Many people with entrepreneurial creativity have begun to use the advantages of the Internet to carry out entrepreneurial activities. This article studies the impact of entrepreneur awe on entrepreneurship in the network environment. Compared with the traditional entrepreneurial form, the threshold of the Internet entrepreneurship environment is low, and the difficulty of entrepreneurship is also less. Opportunity awareness is the starting point of the entire corporate activity and the core element of corporate success. The method of identifying, discovering and using the main entrepreneurs and entrepreneur opportunities in this process is the basic problem in entrepreneur research. This article discusses the influence of entrepreneurs of various enterprises on enterprises, and also studies entrepreneurship. The Internet has brought a certain impact on the thinking and values of college students, directly affecting the employment choices of college students. College students have freshness and curiosity about new things and dare to innovate. College students who are new to society have no rich life experience and insufficient funds. Relying on the Internet to start a business seems to be a very witty path that can help college students to develop their physical and mental health in an all-round way.

A novel artificial intelligence-powered emotional intelligence and mindfulness app (ajivar) for the college student population during the covid-19 pandemic: Quantitative questionnaire study,Sturgill R.,2021,Jmir Formative Research,"Background: Emotional intelligence (EI) and mindfulness can impact the level of anxiety and depression that an individual experiences. These symptoms have been exacerbated among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training. Objective: The main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. Methods: A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49%) were given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group members (50/99, 51%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results: Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years; 27% (27/99) of the group were male and 60% (59/99) identified as Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001). Conclusions: It is possible to deliver EI and mindfulness training in a scalable way using the Ajivar app during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in improvements in anxiety, depression, and EI in the college student population.",10.2196/25372,29,Scopus,85100195888,2-s2.0-85100195888,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100195888

As an important factor affecting people's psychological quality, mental health has been paid more and more attention by people. The effect of traditional mental health education in daily education activities is not very obvious, which cannot achieve a profound impact on people's mental health training and development. In this paper, based on the artificial intelligence online technology, an expert system of mental health education and daily consultation is designed. The system mainly integrates four application modules: psychological knowledge learning, psychological daily evaluation, psychological expert consultation and personal personalized management. The experiment shows that the artificial intelligence online expert consultation system designed in this paper can query daily psychological problems conveniently and quickly. At the same time, the treatment of human psychological problems can be realized through the intelligent online psychological counselling and the relief of psychological symptoms.

“Welcome to your Daily Wellness Check”: The Proposed Evaluation of a SMS-based Conversational Agent for Managing Health and Wellbeing,Kettle L.,2021,Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society,"University students tend to sacrifice healthy lifestyles in favor of academic and financial gain. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to online schooling and reduced access to healthcare resources. To mitigate these pressures, artificial intelligence conversational agents (CA) have addressed mental wellness in the general population but are yet to address physical well-being. Therefore, a CA that can address barriers and improve physical and mental well-being by cultivating healthy behaviors is desired. This research is designed to evaluate the feasibility and user experience of a text-based CA on addressing student barriers for a healthy lifestyle using evidence-based theories including the Theory of Planned Behavior and Motivational Interviewing over a two-week timeframe. Data collection has been paused due to the pandemic; results are expected to show positive impacts on well-being outcomes compared to an information-only control group and support the implementation of CAs to those with less accessibility to healthcare resources.",10.1177/1071181321651297,0,Scopus,85171304955,2-s2.0-85171304955,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171304955

The Creative Composition Problem is embedded within Cecilia: an architecture of a digital companion artificial intelligence agent system composer of dialogue scripts for Well-being and Mental Health. Where Cecilia Framework is instantiated in Well-being and Mental Health domain for optimal well-being development of first year university students. We define the ‘The Problem of Creating a Dialogue Composition (PCDC)’ and we propose a feasible and optimal solution of it. CCP is instantiated in this applied domain to solve PCDC optimizing the Mental Health and Well-being of the student. CCP as PCDC is applied to optimize maximizing the mental health of the student but also maximizing the smoothness, coherence, enjoyment and engagement each time the dialogue session is composed. Cecilia helps students to manage stress/anxiety to attempt the prevention of depression. Students can interact through the digital companion making questions and answers.

Construction of the Teaching Quality Monitoring System of Physical Education Courses in Colleges and Universities Based on the Construction of Smart Campus with Artificial Intelligence,Huang X.,2021,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,"With regard to the development of colleges and universities, ensuring the quality of education is the fundamental goal and main task of teaching daily management. With the continuous improvement of the application level of the Internet and other information technologies, the construction of smart campus in colleges and universities in China is rapidly advancing. This paper studies the construction and innovation strategy of the public sports quality monitoring system and discusses the changes in college students' sports quality after the introduction of smart campuses from the perspective of artificial intelligence and the creation of smart universities. In this paper, the field survey method and other research methods are combined to study, and in the process of data storage, SQL Server database platform is used to store the data. This study shows that the proportion of each element of physical state management has changed significantly before and after college entrance. According to the data, since the introduction of smart campus real name system identification, tracking data, and evaluation functions, the number of college students' physical exercise has increased significantly. The number of students with exercise plan in school 1 has increased from 70 to 222, and that of school 2 has increased from 49 to 199. Before the introduction, the students were very satisfied with the learning effect of physical education, which was 40.12% and increased to 45.70% after the introduction. Before the introduction, the students were very satisfied with the sports equipment, which was 30.12% before the introduction and increased to 35.24% after the introduction. Therefore, building a system for monitoring the quality of public sports in universities is very important for improving the quality of education in public sports in universities and plays an active role in promoting the physical and mental health of students.",10.1155/2021/9907531,29,Scopus,85114668108,2-s2.0-85114668108,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114668108
Deriving College Students' Phone Call Patterns to Improve Student Life,Vhaduri S.,2021,IEEE Access,"When high school students leave their homes for a college education, the students often face enormous changes and challenges in life, such as meeting new people, more responsibilities in life, and being away from family and their comfort zones. These sudden changes often lead to an elevation of stress and anxiety, affecting a student's mental health and well-being and academic progress. With the outbreak of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, this transition moment can worsen with frequent, long-lasting lockdown and associated academic disruption. To help this young population, researchers are increasingly relying on smartphones and wearables, such as smartwatches, to continuously monitor students' daily lives to identify various factors that can affect students' phone call patterns associated with their health and well-being and academic success. In this work, we use different visualizations and statistical techniques to find various geographical places and temporal factors that affect students' phone call patterns (in terms of phone call duration and frequency) to foster the design and delivery of future smartphone-based health interventions using predictive models; thereby, potentially helping students adjust to college life with or without the presence of an emergency, such as pandemic that adversely impacts academic calendar and student life. From our detailed analysis of an 18-month dataset collected from a cohort of 464 freshmen, we obtain insights on communication pattern variations during different temporal contexts, e.g., epochs of a day, days of a week, the parts of a semester, social events, and in various geographical contexts (i.e., places of interest). Finally, we also obtain a negative correlation of-0.29 between physical activity and phone call duration, which can help provide guided feedback to improve future health behaviors.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093493,20,Scopus,85110873044,2-s2.0-85110873044,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110873044
"Suicidality in Bangladeshi young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of behavioral factors, COVID-19 risk and fear, and mental health problems",Mamun M.A.,2021,Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,"Background: It is said that psychological stressors have risen during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may contribute to suicidality. A few studies were conducted investigating suicidality amid the first wave of the pandemic in Bangladesh, but none of these studies explored the predictive role of the suicidality-related factors (eg, behavior and health-related variables, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of suicidality and the predictive models explaining suicidality variance among Bangladeshi young adults during the second wave of the pandemic. Methods: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted during the second wave of the pandemic (between 1 and 13 April 2021; a year after the pandemic's inception in the country). The survey questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, behavior and health-related variables, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, and suicidality. A total of 756 data were analyzed (male 59%; mean age 22.24 ±4.39 years), and hierarchical regression was performed considering suicidality as the dependent variable. A p-value < 0.05 was set to be statistically significant with a 95% of confidence interval. Results: About 8.2% reported having at least suicidal thoughts within the pandemic inception to survey time (one-year suicidal ideation). More specifically, 7.40% had only suicidal ideation, whereas 0.10% planned for suicide, 0.70% attempted suicide. None of the sociodemographic variables was significantly associated with suicidality. Taking drugs, performing less physical activity, poor self-reporting health condition, being comorbid, being at higher COVID-19 risk, having fear of COVID-19 infection, and suffering from depression and anxiety were significantly associated with a higher risk of suicidality. However, the final model including all of the studied variables explained a 17.1% (F=8.245, p<0.001) variance in terms of suicidality. Conclusion: Although this study reported a lower severity of suicidality than prior Bangladeshi studies conducted during the first wave of the pandemic, a portion of people are still at risk of suicide and they should be given attention.",10.2147/RMHP.S330282,18,Scopus,85117208217,2-s2.0-85117208217,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117208217
Prevalence and associated factors of problematic smartphone use during the covid-19 pandemic: A bangladeshi study,Hosen I.,2021,Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,"Background: Problematic smartphone use (PSU) has been increasing hastily in recent decades, and it has become inseparable during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among the students who are at risk of problematic smartphone use. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of PSU during the COVID-19 pandemic among the Bangladeshi students. Methods: A total of 601 Bangladeshi students were recruited through an online-based cross-sectional survey that was conducted between October 7 and November 2, 2020. The survey collected information related to socio-demographics, behavioral health, internet use beha-viors, depression, anxiety, and PSU. Independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA were performed to present the relationship between the studied variables and PSU. Multiple linear regression analysis was also used for investigating the explanatory power of the predictive models for PSU. Results: Surprisingly, about 86.9% of the students scored to be problematic smartphone users (≥21 out of a total 36 based on the Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale). In addition, medical students, engaging in a relationship, performing less physical activity, longer duration of internet use, some sorts of internet use purpose (eg, messaging, watching videos, using social media), depression, and anxiety were significantly associated with higher scores of PSU. After adjusting all the studied variables, the final model explained a 31.3% variance predicting PSU. Conclusion: The present study is one of the first approaches to assess the prevalence of PSU among the Bangladeshi students during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the addiction level was superfluous (and this may be due to more online engagement related to the pandemic). Thus, the study recommended strategies or policies related to the students’ risk-reducing and healthy use of smartphones.",10.2147/RMHP.S325126,61,Scopus,85115237687,2-s2.0-85115237687,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115237687
Mental health and caregiving experiences of family carers supporting people with psychosis,Sin J.,2021,Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences,"Aims: Family carers supporting an individual with psychosis often experience poorer mental health, however, little is known about specific risk factors among these carers. We investigated the associations between demographic, caregiving characteristics and mental health outcomes in family carers supporting an individual with psychosis and compared carers' outcomes with general population norms. Methods: We analysed baseline data from the COPe-support randomised controlled trial of online psychoeducation and peer support for adult carers supporting an individual with psychosis between 2018 and 2020. We collected carers' demographic and health outcome data, including wellbeing using Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS as primary outcome), quality of life using EQ-5D-5L and caregiving experience assessed with Experience of Caregiving Inventory. We tested associations between carers' demographic and caregiving characteristics for each outcome in turn and meta-analysed carers' WEMWBS and EQ-5D-5L with Health Survey England (HSE) general population data from 2016 and 2017, respectively. Results: The 407 carers of people with psychosis had a mean WEMWBS score of 42.2 (s.d. 9.21) and their overall weighted pooled WEMWBS score was 7.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) -8.6 to -6.0, p < 0.01) lower than the HSE general population sample, indicating carers have poorer mental wellbeing by more than double the minimum clinically important difference of 3 points on WEMWBS. Among all caring relationships, partners had poorer wellbeing compared to parents with lower WEMWBS score (-6.8, -16.9 to 3.3, p = 0.03). Single carers had significantly poorer wellbeing (-3.6, -5.6 to -1.5, p < 0.01) and a more negative caregiving experience than those who were cohabiting. Spending more than 35 h per week caregiving increased carers' negative experience significantly (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Carers of people with psychosis have poorer mental health than non-carers. Partners, lone carers and those spending more than 35 h per week on caring were found to be most at risk of poor mental health. Based on the results, we advocate that the details of carers for individuals with psychosis should be added to the existing carers or severe mental illness registers at all general practitioner surgeries and for their wellbeing screened routinely. Future large-scale prospective studies are needed to develop a predictive model to determine risk factors, hence to aid early identification of carers' support needs. Such understandings are also useful to inform tailored intervention development.",10.1017/S2045796020001067,38,Scopus,85099058135,2-s2.0-85099058135,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099058135
Experimental and numerical diagnosis of fatigue foot using convolutional neural network,Sharifi A.,2021,Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering,"Fatigue is an essential criterion for physiotherapy in injured athletes. Muscle fatigue mechanism also is a crucial matter in designing a workout program. It is mainly related to physical injury, cerebrovascular accident, spinal cord injury, and rheumatologic disease. The leg is one of the organs in the body where fatigue is visible, and usually, the first fatigue traces in the human body are shown. The main objective of the article is to diagnosis tired and untired feet base on digital footprint images. Therefore, the foot images of students in the age group of 20–30 were examined. The device is a digital footprint scanner. This device includes a plate screen equipped with pressure sensors and footprints in the image. A treadmill is used for 8 min to tire our test individuals. Therefore, six methods of k-nearest-neighbor classifier, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, naïve Bayesian learning, decision tree, and convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture are presented to achieve the goal. First, the images are grayscale and divide into four regions, and the mean and variance of pressure in each of the four areas are extracted as features. Finally, the classification is accomplished using machine learning methods. Then, the results are compared with a proposed CNN architecture.

Diagnosing Mental Health Patient WhileMaintaining Anonymity,Saboo S.,2021,2021 IEEE Mysore Sub Section International Conference Mysurucon 2021,"Mental Health has become a significant public health concern worldwide, yet the stigma associated with this makes it an immense societal burden. It is being believed that the age of onset of mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety has decreased consistently, the effects of which can now be seen in children and adolescents. Continuous negligence of mental health by Indian society has made it very difficult for young people to express their mental well-being. So few technical advancements and societal ignorance have made its pace of development somewhat slow, but recently machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques have piqued the interest of several industries constituting the healthcare industry. Machine learning makes use of advanced mathematical techniques to construct systems with an ability to learn from given datasets, thus enabling analysts and developers to extract vital information from those datasets easily. With the help of such advanced techniques, the aim is to propose a platform that will help people express their emotional state of mind anonymously, without the fear of being judged. In this research paper, an application-based approach is used to provide a personalized experience to users.

Perceptions and Opinions of Patients about Mental Health Chatbots: Scoping Review,Abd-Alrazaq A.A.,2021,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"Background: Chatbots have been used in the last decade to improve access to mental health care services. Perceptions and opinions of patients influence the adoption of chatbots for health care. Many studies have been conducted to assess the perceptions and opinions of patients about mental health chatbots. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no review of the evidence surrounding perceptions and opinions of patients about mental health chatbots. Objective: This study aims to conduct a scoping review of the perceptions and opinions of patients about chatbots for mental health. Methods: The scoping review was carried out in line with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Studies were identified by searching 8 electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE and Embase) in addition to conducting backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. In total, 2 reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data from the included studies. Data were synthesized using thematic analysis. Results: Of 1072 citations retrieved, 37 unique studies were included in the review. The thematic analysis generated 10 themes from the findings of the studies: Usefulness, ease of use, responsiveness, understandability, acceptability, attractiveness, trustworthiness, enjoyability, content, and comparisons. Conclusions: The results demonstrated overall positive perceptions and opinions of patients about chatbots for mental health. Important issues to be addressed in the future are the linguistic capabilities of the chatbots: They have to be able to deal adequately with unexpected user input, provide high-quality responses, and have to show high variability in responses. To be useful for clinical practice, we have to find ways to harmonize chatbot content with individual treatment recommendations, that is, a personalization of chatbot conversations is required.",10.2196/17828,183,Scopus,85099894870,2-s2.0-85099894870,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099894870
Smart Healthcare System for Psychological Disorders in Smart Cities,Bindu Bhavani B.,2021,Eai Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing,"As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and technology-oriented, a new wave of smart apps is changing human approach towards everyday activities. The ideas of “smart cities” are proposed as the future of urbanism. A smart city is a city with the innovative Internet of Things (IoT) and Information and communication technology (ICT), which enhance the quality of life of urban population, increasing business competitiveness and ensuring environmental sustainability. All of these characteristics are used in the framework of Deloitte’s Smart City, and its improvement can be found in the following areas: economy, mobility, security, education, living and the environment. A research performed by Grand View showed that the annual growth rate of the smart cities across the globes is expected to reach 18.9%, that is $237.6 billion by 2025. Smart cities cover a large number and a variety of domains and enhanced application areas with technological advancements. One of the important applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in smart cities is health care. For good economy of smart cities, human health is a priority, which is beginning to be looked at comprehensively. Healthcare of a person includes the well-being of both body and mind. There is no doubt that the health sector has been looking forward to the technological advancements over the last few years. To provide health services to the increasing population following urban life style will be a time-taking process. Citizens look after themselves more quickly and efficiently. It’s no secret that city life is stressful. It is fast paced, noisy, expensive and demanding. People often feel the need to rest, to escape some time from this life. Any psychologist will verify that these are general concepts. It is estimated that 1 in 6 people worldwide suffers from mental health disorders, and this is causing personal and financial collapse. Psychological disorders are among the most common causes of disability and death. Suicide is a commonly seen predominant cause of death among the youth. Older generations also suffer from mental disorders like anxiety, depression and dementia. This study aims to inspect the promising future of innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on a psychological disorder. Psychological data training, prescription of the medication and therapy, monitoring and analysis and decision making for improvement are some of the AI-supported activities reviewed in this study. In smart cities using smart health technology, the interaction of the data generated by smart devices will be smooth for medical researchers, experts and physicians to give improved personal care and treatment.",10.1007/978-3-030-48539-9_6,4,Scopus,85102730357,2-s2.0-85102730357,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102730357
Development of NLP-Integrated Intelligent Web System for E-Mental Health,Hassan A.,2021,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the need for a better health care facility is highlighted more than ever. Besides physical health, mental health conditions have become a significant concern. Unfortunately, there are few opportunities for people to receive mental health care. There are inadequate facilities for seeking mental health support even in big cities, let alone remote areas. This paper presents the structure and implementation procedures for a mental health support system combining technology and professionals. The system is a web platform where mental health seekers can register and use functionalities like NLP-based chatbot for personality assessment, chatting with like-minded people, and one-to-one video conferencing with a mental health professional. The video calling feature of the system has emotion detection capabilities using computer vision. The system also includes downloadable prescription facilities and a payment gateway for secure transactions. From a technological aspect, the conversational NLP-based chatbot and computer vision-powered video calling are the system's most important features. The system has a documentation facility to analyze the mental health condition over time. The web platform is built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. MongoDB is used as the database of the platform. The NLP chatbot is built on a three-layered deep neural network model that is programmed in the Python language and uses the NLTK, TensorFlow, and Keras sequential API. Video conference is one of the most important features of the platform. To create the video calling feature, Express.js, Socket.io, and Socket.io-client have been used. The emotion detection feature is implemented on video conferences using computer vision, Haar Cascade, and TensorFlow. All the implemented features are tested and work fine. The targeted users for the platform are teenagers, youth, and the middle-aged population. Mental health-seeking is still considered taboo in some societies today. Apart from basic established facilities, this social dilemma of undergoing treatment for mental health is causing severe damage to individuals. A solution to this problem can be a remote platform for mental health support. With this goal in mind, this system is designed to provide mental health support to people remotely from anywhere worldwide.",10.1155/2021/1546343,18,Scopus,85122364022,2-s2.0-85122364022,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122364022
Natural language processing and machine learning of electronic health records for prediction of first-time suicide attempts,Tsui F.R.,2021,JAMIA Open,"Objective: Limited research exists in predicting first-time suicide attempts that account for two-thirds of suicide decedents. We aimed to predict first-time suicide attempts using a large data-driven approach that applies natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to unstructured (narrative) clinical notes and structured electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods: This case-control study included patients aged 10-75 years who were seen between 2007 and 2016 from emergency departments and inpatient units. Cases were first-time suicide attempts from coded diagnosis; controls were randomly selected without suicide attempts regardless of demographics, following a ratio of nine controls per case. Four data-driven ML models were evaluated using 2-year historical EHR data prior to suicide attempt or control index visits, with prediction windows from 7 to 730 days. Patients without any historical notes were excluded. Model evaluation on accuracy and robustness was performed on a blind dataset (30% cohort). Results: The study cohort included 45 238 patients (5099 cases, 40 139 controls) comprising 54 651 variables from 5.7 million structured records and 798 665 notes. Using both unstructured and structured data resulted in significantly greater accuracy compared to structured data alone (area-under-the-curve [AUC]: 0.932 vs. 0.901 P <. 001). The best-predicting model utilized 1726 variables with AUC = 0.932 (95% CI, 0.922-0.941). The model was robust across multiple prediction windows and subgroups by demographics, points of historical most recent clinical contact, and depression diagnosis history. Conclusions: Our large data-driven approach using both structured and unstructured EHR data demonstrated accurate and robust first-time suicide attempt prediction, and has the potential to be deployed across various populations and clinical settings.",10.1093/jamiaopen/ooab011,70,Scopus,85124044243,2-s2.0-85124044243,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124044243
Artificial Intelligence Framework for Identifying the Population Addicted to Drugs: Markov Decision Process,Kaur S.,2021,Proceedings 2021 2nd International Conference on Computational Methods in Science and Technology Iccmst 2021,"Drug addiction is a complex disease which is growing in every corner of the world. Adaptive interventions such as trend setters, life style, stress, depression, peer pressure etc. are hiking than to control over the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases like heart disease, kidney problems, lung cancer, skin cancer, diabetes. The myriad of drug de-addiction centers has not effectively reached the optimal treatment over time. The goal of the paper is to develop a general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) framework that address self-diagnosing is the self-treatment like a doctor. This approach uses Markov decision process to observe self believe states about the victim, the plans and actions and new observation obtained using the electronic health record in the database. Self-monitoring system is designed which saves the values of the test and the user can self-diagnose by repeating the test. User can have control on the severity level of addiction or proneness whether it is low, moderate and high. The result reveals the AI approach outperforms by performing the series of simulations conducted under varying circumstances by the youth to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Youths’ Digital Participation in the Early Phases of COVID-19 Lockdown,Pietilä I.,2021,Lecture Notes in Computer Science Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics,"On 18 March 2020 the Finnish Government declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19 causing public services to limit their capacity or to close completely. Well-founded concerns have been raised on how the restrictions affect young people’s well-being and their possibilities to get support. Youths use digital technologies in their everyday lives, and it can be assumed that the usage has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can also be a benefit when coping with the situation. This paper explores young people’s subjective experiences regarding digital services, digital societal participation, and social interactions in the early phases of COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the youths’ backgrounds in relation to their utilisation of digital technologies and services are examined. A mixed-method survey including closed-ended and open-ended questions was conducted in spring 2020. The sample included 49 young Finnish people aged 15–26. Results suggest that digitality supports youths in their activities, such as work and school, societal participation, and social interactions. Also, problems, such as inadequate ICT skills and technical issues were identified. Furthermore, the ICT-savvy youths seem to benefit highly from digitality in comparison to their less ICT-savvy peers. This paper contributes to the discussions of digital divides, equal access to societal participation, and the activities that may support youths’ coping in similar future lockdown situations.",10.1007/978-3-030-82824-0_1,1,Scopus,85115276187,2-s2.0-85115276187,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115276187
Refinement of Bengali Obscene Words using Sequence to Sequence RNNs,Afroz U.S.,2021,2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies Icccnt 2021,"In the recent past, a growing number of users have tolerated offensive behaviors or have witnessed objectionable activities through virtual platforms. Defamatory and abusive words are mostly used in the comment section on social networking sites that are more detrimental for children and teenagers. This type of offensive word can shape their thoughts in the wrong manners and influence their mental health. Our work targets to filter and replace the negative impression of defamatory words on children that are used on Facebook with the help of sequence to sequence RNNs along with LSTM. For doing this experiment, we have created a dataset by the comments and posts from Facebook. and also, done data pre-preprocessing, counting of vocabulary, counting of missing words, embedding words, finding the missing word, and so on. Our main focus was identifying the offensive word and filtering that word by the abstract text summarizer model and decreasing the training loss. After applying the model on the dataset, practically we have reached our target to decrease the training loss to 0.007 and are capable of making a filtered text from given input text.",10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579560,1,Scopus,85126188744,2-s2.0-85126188744,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126188744
Cyberbullying Classification based on Social Network Analysis,Wang A.,2021,Proceedings IEEE 7th International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications Bigdataservice 2021,"With the popularity of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, people widely share their opinions and comments over the Internet. The extensive use of social media has also caused a lot of problems. A representative problem is Cyberbullying, which is a serious social problem, mostly among teenagers. Cyberbullying occurs when a social media user posts aggressive words or phrases to harass other users, and that can lead to negatively affects on their mental and social well-being. Additionally, it may ruin the reputation of that media. We are considering the problem of detecting posts that are aggressive. Moreover, we try to detect Cyberbullies. In this research, we study Cyberbullying as a classification problem by combining text mining techniques, and the graph structure of the social network relationships that are based on a dataset from Twitter. We enhance a given dataset to a new one that has more information for each tweet (post). We manage to improve the classification accuracy by considering the additional social network features that we get from the user's follower list and retweet information.",10.1109/BigDataService52369.2021.00016,10,Scopus,85126202238,2-s2.0-85126202238,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126202238
A peek into one's emotion through pen: Analyzing individual's emotion through their thoughts expressed on various social media platforms using ensemble classifier,Shree S.,2021,2021 4th International Conference on Electrical Computer and Communication Technologies Icecct 2021,"Maximum countries of the world are considered as the youth or young nation. But unfortunately, these young ones are the ones suffering the most from emotional distress and suicide ideation. In India alone, every hour one student commits suicide and nearly 28 per day. (NRCB). The NCRB data shows that 10,159 students died by suicide in 2018, an increase from 9,905 in 2017, and 9,478 in 2016 [1]. According to the survey conducted by CSDS in 2017 between the age group of 15-34 approximately one out of every four youth moderately suffered from depression, loneliness, worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts. 6% of them got suicidal thoughts at least once [1]. Despite increasing knowledge, most affected young people do not receive mental health care because the professionals can not easily identify such groups of people [2]. With most people expressing their thoughts and emotions on social media whether positive or negative, examining their posting on the internet has become an essential part of identifying a person's emotion. Manual identification and examining of this data can be very time-consuming so this paper uses a much better and technical aspect to solve this problem. A dataset is formed by the collection of a few individual's daily blogs and texts and a combination of machine learning classifiers is used to identify an individual's emotion. Then the accuracy of these classifiers is tested and the best classifier is used in the system to predict people's emotions. The result of the analysis shows that the classifier in the system performs better than the other individual classifiers, professionals can understand more people's emotions and see early signs of emotional distress and provide them with assistance.",10.1109/ICECCT52121.2021.9616713,0,Scopus,85123427233,2-s2.0-85123427233,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123427233
STP:Suicidal tendency prediction among the youth using social network data,Sharma M.,2021,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,"The suicide tendency is increasing day to day. It is having a negative impact on our youth. Human at possibility of suicide does not want help before trying to attempt and do not feel necessity to any mental health counselling. As a result, suicidal tendency is becoming social challenge. At the same time, social media are becoming popular for communication and exchange emotional expression to the world. Social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram play major role for emotion sharing. Therefore, huge number of people publishes their emotion of depression and happiness within notes in these social media like Twitter. Social platform like Twitter has a large number of collection of emotional notes. In this situation, machine learning helps in early prediction of the depression and suicidal tendency. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a soft solution which is able to early detect suicidal tendency among the youth. In this approach, we train a model with genuine suicidal notes and post collected from different sources and generate score for input social media tweet high or low for social tendency prediction. With the help of social media postings like Twitter, we are able to identify risk of suicide.",10.1007/978-981-15-4851-2_17,5,Scopus,85087010936,2-s2.0-85087010936,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087010936
An innovative platform to promote social media literacy in school contexts,Taibi D.,2021,Proceedings of the European Conference on E Learning Ecel,"In spite of the impressive number of adolescents using social media, only a minority is aware of the risks associated with the use of the Internet. Hate speech, violation of personal rights, psychological attacks, deceiving people with fake accounts, as well as cyberbullying, harassment and insults are some examples of toxic content that can jeopardize adolescent well-being on the Web. Social Media literacy paths in school contexts provide students with the proper defence instruments to face these problems. Furthermore, it is important to underline the role of social media on both the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of adolescents which has short-and long-term influences when using these virtual environments. However, traditional teaching approaches are not enough to engage students, and the need for innovative learning activities and tools emerges. In this paper we present an online platform specifically designed to support the development of competences related to Information and Data Literacy, Communication and Collaboration and Digital Content Creation. These competences are connected to the most recent versions of the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens, and the Global framework of reference on digital literacy skills promoted by UNESCO. The platform is based on PixelFed, an open-source alternative to Instagram, so that adolescents can practice with an environment they are familiar with. Our platform extends the PixelFed environment with functionalities designed to implement use cases that make students aware of the mechanisms behind social media, such as the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to filter the content they have access to. This platform has been experimented during a pilot run with secondary school students, by proposing them educational activities based on our platform, aimed at educating and supporting students to increase their awareness and counteract the problems that arise within social media.",10.34190/EEL.21.064,15,Scopus,85121585510,2-s2.0-85121585510,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121585510
Detection of Harassment Type of Cyberbullying: A Dictionary of Approach Words and Its Impact,Mahbub S.,2021,Security and Communication Networks,"The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effects of predatory approach words in the detection of cyberbullying and to propose a mechanism of generating a dictionary of such approach words. The research incorporates analysis of chat logs from convicted felons, to generate a dictionary of sexual approach words. By analysing data across multiple social networks, the study demonstrates the usefulness of such a dictionary of approach words in detection of online predatory behaviour through machine learning algorithms. It also shows the difference between the nature of contents across specific social network platforms. The proposed solution to detect cyberbullying and the domain of approach words are scalable to fit real-life social media, which can have a positive impact on the overall health of online social networks. Different types of cyberbullying have different characteristics. However, existing cyberbullying detection works are not targeted towards any of these specific types. This research is tailored to focus on sexual harassment type of cyberbullying and proposes a novel dictionary of approach words. Since cyberbullying is a growing threat to the mental health and intellectual development of adolescents in the society, models targeted towards the detection of specific type of online bullying or predation should be encouraged among social network researchers.",10.1155/2021/5594175,21,Scopus,85108024126,2-s2.0-85108024126,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108024126
Scaling Depression Level Through Facial Image Processing and Social Media Analysis,Bhayani A.,2021,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,"One of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents is depression. Often, a person going through mental health issues hesitate to consult a counselor. Moreover, they are not willing to share their feelings with their near ones. Technology can play a vital role and can be the first line of support in such a situation. As people are more active on social media, it can be used successfully to help or diagnose physical and mental illness.

Progressophobia in the new temporality of the digital world,Shestakova I.G.,2021,Voprosy Filosofii,"The paper considers the alarmism inherent in humanity regarding changes caused by the entry into life of achievements of scientific and technological progress. It is noted that all opponents of progress use the fruits of his previous achievements, but at the same time express fears about newly emerging innovations, since they cause discomfort, bringing to the world something unusual, in relation to which tradition has not yet constituted. It is quite expected that similar phobias are also caused by the development of digital technologies – fears about the digital degradation of youth, fear of artificial intelligence, etc. In the digital world, however, there is another reason for the rejection of progress. This is the pace of the emergence and invasion of a novelty into the space of human existence. Whereas in previous eras, adaptation to innovations passed through several generations, today radical transformations of the technological and, as a result, socioeconomic infrastructure occur many times in the course of one human life. A qualitative leap in the speed of socio-technological development and the problems generated by the new temporality of the digital world in the conditions of a sharp narrowing of the horizon of foresight form chronic anxiety, which is based on doubts about the future, the correctness of the chosen life path and even the consistency of ideas about the meaning of life and human destination, gained in the process of modern upbringing and education.",10.21146/0042-8744-2021-7-61-71,11,Scopus,85111938067,2-s2.0-85111938067,https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111938067

There has been a drastic change in the life of people due to this pandemic because of which they are suffering from mental stress, financial problems, anxiety, etc. Different measures such as lockdown and social distancing were adopted by almost every country to control the pandemic. People have lost jobs, have got salary cuts, and are suffering from great financial losses due to these measures which are causing mental stress to the people. The youth is also facing much problems due to closing of educational institutions, sudden shift toward online mode of education, and nonavailability of jobs due to falling economy in COVID. Hence, we prepared a questionnaire about the problems faced by people. The questions were divided into three sections - education, health, and lifestyle. The questionnaire was filled by individuals in the age group of 17-30 years in India. Responses were collected and analyzed using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms such as KNN, logistic regression, and SVM.
